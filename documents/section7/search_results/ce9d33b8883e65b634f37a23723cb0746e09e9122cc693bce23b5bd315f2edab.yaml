    measures 1. Introduction Water distribution networks are vital infrastructural
    systems that ensure potable water delivery to households, industries, and other
    consumers in urban and rural settings [1]. These networks, often sprawling over
    vast areas, consist of interconnected pipes, reservoirs, pumps, valves, and other
    components. Ensuring these networks’ efficient and uninterrupted operation is
    paramount not only for public health and safety but also for economic and environmental
    reasons [2,3]. Leaks in water distribution networks represent one of the most
    persistent challenges faced by utilities worldwide [4,5]. They lead to significant
    water loss, which is especially concerning given the increasing water scarcity
    in many parts of the world [6]. According to the World Bank, an estimated 32 billion
    cubic meters of treated water are lost yearly due to leaks in urban systems, equivalent
    to nearly USD 40 billion in financial costs [7]. Beyond the economic implications,
    leaks can lead to reduced pressure in the system, making it susceptible to external
    contamination and thus posing health risks. Additionally, the energy and resources
    expended in treating and pumping the lost water contribute to unnecessary environmental
    impacts [8]. Such effects encompass wasting water resources and increased CO2
    emissions due to the energy consumption related to the treatment of excess water
    volumes with excessive chemical components. Uneven daily and yearly consumption
    patterns critically impact water distribution networks. During peak consumption
    periods, increased demand can lower system pressure and escalate flow rates, potentially
    exacerbating existing leaks or causing new ones due to the added stress on the
    infrastructure [9]. Conversely, during low-demand periods, reduced flow rates
    can make leaks less detectable. These variations must be taken into account in
    the design and operation of leak detection strategies, as they influence both
    the likelihood and detectability of leaks. As such, understanding and adapting
    to these consumption patterns is essential for effective leak management, reducing
    water loss, and ensuring the reliability of supply [10,11]. Given the complexity
    and vastness of water distribution networks, there’s a growing interest in leveraging
    advanced mathematical and computational techniques for enhanced leak detection
    and system analysis. The primary research problem this study addresses is the
    need for more sophisticated, accurate, and efficient methods for identifying zone
    leaks within these complex networks [4,12]. To tackle this issue, our study explores
    the application of graph theory, a crucial interdisciplinary tool that enhances
    our understanding and management of complex systems [13]. While graph theory has
    been successfully employed in various fields such as epidemiology to trace and
    control the spread of diseases [14,15] and urban planning to optimize transport
    networks and traffic management [16,17], its potential in water distribution management
    is particularly compelling. By translating the physical network of water distribution
    into a graph of nodes and edges, representing the infrastructure’s interconnectivity,
    we can implement algorithms to simulate fluid movement, reveal usage patterns,
    and, crucially, detect leakage. The objectives of our research are to develop
    a comprehensive methodology that integrates graph theory into the analysis of
    water distribution networks to improve leak detection and network management.
    We aim to demonstrate how graph-theoretical approaches can provide deeper insights
    into network dynamics, identify critical areas prone to leaks, and enhance the
    overall efficiency and reliability of water distribution systems. Through this
    study, we aspire to contribute valuable tools and strategies to the field of water
    management, helping to mitigate the challenges posed by leaks and advancing the
    sustainability of water resources. The rest of the article is structured as follows:
    Section 2, “Literature Review”, offers an overview of existing studies that intersect
    graph theory with WDS. Section 3, “Graph Theory Fundamentals and Hydraulic Metrics
    in WDS Analysis”, outlines the foundational aspects of graph theory alongside
    key hydraulic measures pertinent to WDS analysis. Section 4, “Methodology”, is
    the paper’s core, detailing our study’s methodology and applying it to a well-known
    WDS for illustrative purposes. Section 5, “Case Studies”, presents empirical findings
    from applying our methods to four distinct WDSs. Section 6, “Practical Implications
    of Findings”, presents some practical implications of the proposed method. The
    paper concludes with a discussion that synthesizes the results and provides a
    comprehensive summary of the insights gained. 2. Literature Review In the literature,
    multiple methodologies have been proposed to analyze the resilience of water distribution
    systems in order to detect water leaks. One prevalent method is the performance-based
    approach, which employs hydraulic models to evaluate how the system responds under
    different hypothetical scenarios [18]. These models typically analyze the flow
    and pressure characteristics within the network’s pipes and junctions, simulating
    various operational conditions to predict system behavior during normal and adverse
    events [19,20]. For this purpose, we present related works that exemplify the
    integration of graph theory in WDS, followed by a discussion on its application
    and impact. 2.1. Graph Theory Integration in Water Distribution Systems To further
    enrich this analysis, integrating hydraulic metrics with graph theory measures
    enhances the precision of leakage detection in WDSs, thereby addressing a notable
    gap in the existing research. Ulusoy et al. [21] sought to analyze pipe criticality’s
    impact on the overall resilience of a network by integrating graph theory methods
    with fundamental principles of pipe hydraulics. This paper overcomes the limitations
    of traditional hydraulic methods and most surrogate measures of redundancy by
    introducing a hydraulically informed graph-theoretic measure of pipe criticality
    known as Water Flow Edge Betweenness Centrality (WFEBC). Similarly, Dunn and Wilkinson
    [22] developed a method that merges flow parameters with betweenness centrality
    and degree centrality to predict changes in flow dynamics caused by node removal.
    This integrated metric serves as a tool for identifying essential elements in
    water distribution networks, aiding in the management and maintenance of these
    critical infrastructures. Additionally, Agathokleous et al. [23] observed a significant
    correlation between hydraulic metrics and network centrality measures. Nadro et
    al. [24] introduced an analysis framework based on Eigenvector centrality to support
    water utilities in the decision-making process for efficient supply management.
    Moreover, the study by Giudicianni et al. [25] aims to assess the criticality
    of water distribution networks facing natural disasters, particularly in the frequent
    context of limited site-specific information. It introduces a novel algorithm
    to detect the fractal structure of WDS layouts and a new vulnerability index called
    Cut-Vulnerability Vcut, which accounts for topological self-similarity and global
    vulnerability in WDSs. These advances provide a significant contribution to our
    understanding of the structural and functional robustness of water distribution
    networks, further supporting the integrated approach of combining hydraulic and
    graph theory analyses. Another recent research study demonstrates the incorporation
    of complex network analysis using graph theory for identifying critical components
    in drainage networks [26]. 2.2. Application and Impact in WDS Generally, graph
    theory emerges as a potent analytical tool, transcending its mathematical origins
    to offer valuable insights. Its adaptability has been demonstrated across a multitude
    of disciplines, such as the criminal field [27,28], e-learning [29], and social
    media [30,31]. Each application demonstrates graph theory’s remarkable capacity
    to address structured data and solve complex problems in many environments. Building
    on the foundational concepts discussed previously, the application of graph theory
    in WDS research has proven to be of considerable value [32,33]. It enables a structured
    analysis of the network’s topology, enhancing operational efficiency, and improving
    resilience. It provides a robust framework for optimizing system design, facilitating
    effective leak detection, ensuring water quality, and supporting strategic maintenance
    and expansion. Among these advancements, Kibum et al. [34] introduced a novel
    methodology grounded in graph theory to pinpoint susceptible segments and accidental
    isolations in water distribution systems. This approach utilizes a node-based
    adjacency matrix for clear visualization of network connectivity, streamlined
    by a single row-first search method. In addition, Tzatchkov et al. [35] outlined
    graph theory algorithms for sectorizing water distribution systems. Their paper
    details how these algorithms help divide a large network into smaller, independent
    sectors, identify disconnected nodes, and analyze water source contributions.
    Implemented in an AutoCAD-based system, these methods have improved water distribution
    efficiency in Mexican cities by aiding in managing and reducing water losses.
    Further investigations by Tzatchkov et al. [36] demonstrate that graph theory
    is instrumental in simplifying the management of a WDS by facilitating its division
    into sectors and improving the accuracy of leak detection. Complementarily, another
    study by Shekofteh et al. [37] presents a novel leak detection method for WDSs
    that leverages graph theory for network decomposition. By dividing the WDS into
    manageable sections, the method uses pressure logger data and artificial neural
    networks to pinpoint the location of leaks. This iterative process narrows down
    the leak to a specific area within the network. Applied to the Balerma WDS under
    various scenarios, the approach proved accurate, showcasing graph theory’s utility
    in enhancing the efficiency of leak detection in WDSs amidst water scarcity challenges.
    Additionally, a recent study [38] proposes a procedure to accelerate the computation
    of shortest paths in WDSs, highlighting the method’s efficiency in reducing computational
    time and its crucial role in real-time contamination detection and leakage control.
    This innovative approach underscores the potential of graph theory in enhancing
    operational integrity and robustness of water distribution systems. On the other
    hand, graph theory can be utilized to evaluate and assess the robustness and operational
    integrity of water distribution systems—this serves as the main objective of our
    paper. We delve into the application of graph theory in the context of urban resilience,
    specifically within the framework of water distribution. Yazdani et al. [13] propose
    a deterministic network analysis method to evaluate the robustness and vulnerability
    of water distribution systems. These systems are conceptualized as intricate graphs,
    enabling a comprehensive assessment of their resilience against disruptions. Complementing
    this, Christopher Dzuwa’s study [39] presents an algorithm that identifies potential
    leakage points by calculating the risk of pipe bursts at network nodes. The algorithm
    leverages a sensitivity analysis that compares pressure readings at various nodes
    under different leakage scenarios to a standard no-leak model. This process is
    instrumental in detecting irregularities that may indicate a leak. Through this
    multifaceted approach, the study aims not only to locate potential weak points
    but also to prioritize them for maintenance or further investigation, thereby
    enhancing the system’s reliability and service delivery. 3. Graph Theory Fundamentals
    and Hydraulic Metrics in WDS Analysis This section delves into the foundational
    elements of our analysis, clarifies the problem statement, and defines the basic
    concepts used in this paper. 3.1. Graph Properties Graph-theoretical concepts
    are integral to leak detection in water distribution systems by offering a framework
    to model the network, identify critical nodes, and analyze flow patterns. These
    concepts facilitate the detection of anomalies in water flow and pressure that
    may indicate leaks. In this subsection, we define the fundamental concepts used
    in our work [40], drawing upon the characterizations and methodologies discussed
    in the context of WDSs as complex networks [41]. Model formulation. In this work,
    we model a water distribution system as a simple directed graph G(N;E) composed
    by a set of nodes N = 𝑢 1 ; 𝑢 2 ;…; 𝑢 𝑛 and a set of edges E⊂N×N . The nodes (vertices)
    represent reservoirs, tanks, or junctions, and the edges (links) correspond to
    pipes that transport water from one node to another (see Figure 1). We denote
    as 𝑛 = |N| and 𝑚 = |E|, respectively, the number of nodes and the number of edges
    of graph G. We employ the terms node, vertex, and junction (resp., edge, link,
    and pipe) interchangeably, as well as the terms network and graph. Figure 1. Schematics
    of a water distribution system (red arrows represent network flow). Problem definition.
    Take a WDS modeled by graph G(N; E), where N is a set nodes and E is a set of
    edges. We seek to divide G into a set, D, of disjoint zones (communities), ensuring
    that each junction 𝑢 𝑖 ∈ N belongs to only one community. This segmentation is
    a crucial step toward conducting an efficient sensitivity analysis for leak detection
    in WDSs. Therefore, our goal is to perform a diagnosis and risk assessment of
    water engineering systems, focusing on junctions and pipes because they represent
    the critical points susceptible to leakage. Definition 1  (Network Flow). Network
    flow in the context of WDSs refers to the rate at which water moves through the
    network’s pipelines. It is a critical parameter that determines the ability of
    the system to meet consumer demand at various points. Definition 2  (Cycle (Loop)).
    A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node without traversing any
    edge more than once. In WDSs, cycles are essential for redundancy; they ensure
    that if one part of the network fails, there is an alternative path for water
    distribution. Definition 3  (Adjacency). This refers to the direct connection
    between two nodes. In WDSs, two junctions are adjacent if they are connected by
    a single pipe. The adjacency matrix is a common mathematical representation that
    indicates which nodes in the network are adjacent to each other. Definition 4  (Path).
    In graph theory, a path is a sequence of edges that connects a sequence of distinct
    nodes. In WDSs, a path would represent a possible route for water to travel from
    one point to another within the network. Definition 5  (Subgraph). In water distribution
    systems, a subgraph is a subset of the network, comprising specific junctions
    and pipes, usually representing an operational area or manageable district. These
    zones are determined by various criteria, such as hydraulic connectivity, geographical
    boundaries, or demand patterns, facilitating targeted analysis and management
    within a larger network. Definition 6  (Degree Centrality). Degree centrality
    ( 𝐶 𝐷 ) is defined as the number of edges incident upon a node. In simpler terms,
    it measures the number of direct connections a node has to other nodes within
    the network. For a WDS, degree centrality would indicate how many pipes are connected
    to a junction, reservoir, or tank. A high degree of centrality at a junction might
    suggest it is a significant point for water distribution, potentially affecting
    many consumers if disrupted. For any undirected graph G, the degree of node v
    is: 𝐶 𝐷 (𝑣)= ∑ 𝑢∈𝑉 𝑎 𝑢𝑣 (1) where 𝑎 𝑢𝑣 are the elements of the adjacency matrix,
    indicating a connection between nodes u and v. Definition 7  (Closeness Centrality).
    Closeness centrality ( 𝐶 𝐶 ) measures how close a node is to all other nodes in
    the network. It is calculated as the reciprocal of the sum of the shortest path
    distances from a given node to all other nodes in the graph. Nodes with higher
    closeness centrality can reach all other nodes more quickly than those with lower
    closeness centrality. In WDSs, this measure can help identify which nodes are
    best positioned to distribute water efficiently across the entire network. Mathematically,
    for a node v: 𝐶 𝐶 (𝑣)= 1 ∑ 𝑢≠𝑣 𝑑(𝑣,𝑢) (2) where 𝑑(𝑣,𝑢) is the shortest path distance
    between nodes v and u. Definition 8  (Betweenness Centrality). Betweenness centrality
    ( 𝐶 𝐵 ) quantifies the number of times a node acts as a bridge along the shortest
    path between two other nodes. It is an indicator of a node’s control over the
    network’s flow, reflecting its potential to facilitate or impede water movement
    through the network. In WDSs, a node with high betweenness centrality would be
    critical for water flow between different network parts. Such nodes, if compromised,
    could significantly impact the network’s performance and reliability. The betweenness
    centrality of a node v is calculated by the following formula: 𝐶 𝐵 (𝑣)= ∑ 𝑠≠𝑣≠𝑡∈𝑉
    𝜎 𝑠𝑡 (𝑣) 𝜎 𝑠𝑡 (3) where 𝜎 𝑠𝑡 is the total number of shortest paths from node s
    to node t and 𝜎 𝑠𝑡 (𝑣) is the number of those paths passing through v. Definition
    9  (Link Betweenness Centrality). Link Betweenness Centrality ( 𝐶 𝐿𝐵 ) is a measure
    used in graph theory to quantify the importance of an edge within a network. It
    is defined as the number of shortest paths between pairs of nodes that pass through
    a particular edge. In WDSs, a higher betweenness centrality indicates that a link
    has a greater influence on the efficiency of the network’s water distribution
    and is more critical to its connectivity. The Link Betweenness Centrality edge
    e is: 𝐶 𝐿𝐵 (𝑒)= ∑ 𝑠≠𝑡∈𝑉 𝜎 𝑠𝑡 (𝑒) 𝜎 𝑠𝑡 (4) where 𝜎 𝑠𝑡 is the total number of shortest
    paths from node s to node t and 𝜎 𝑠𝑡 (𝑒) is the number of those paths that pass
    along edge e. 3.2. Hydraulic Measures Hydraulic measures refer to the various
    quantifiable characteristics that describe the behavior and performance of the
    fluid within the water distribution systems. Each junction in the WDS is characterized
    by: 1. Elevation (m)—The node’s height, which influences the gravitational pressure
    in the system. 2. Demand (m3/h)—The water requirement at that node is essential
    for ensuring adequate supply. 3. Pressure (m)—The fluid force exerted at the node
    is critical for water delivery and system integrity. The system’s edges represent
    the physical pipes and are defined by: 1. Length (m)—The distance between two
    nodes, affecting headloss and velocity. 2. Diameter (mm)—The width of the pipe,
    which dictates the flow rate and velocity. 3. Flow (m3/h)—The volume of water
    moving through the pipe per unit of time. 4. Velocity (m3/h)—The velocity of the
    water flow is crucial for preventing sedimentation and ensuring effective scouring.
    5. Headloss (m/s)—The loss of pressure due to friction within the length of the
    pipe. 6. Volume (m3)—The pipe’s water capacity can be influenced by the pipe’s
    cross-sectional area. It is important to note that while these are the primary
    measures used in our study, there are other parameters, such as pipe age and material;
    water quality indicators; and other factors, that could be considered in hydraulic
    analysis. However, our focus was on those metrics that were readily available
    and most pertinent to our experimental WDS. Considering these hydraulic measures,
    graph theory can be applied to analyze and optimize the WDS. This analytical approach
    is essential for designing a network that delivers water reliably and maintains
    quality, manages pressure effectively across different elevations, and ensures
    the system’s overall resilience and sustainability. 4. Methodology The flowchart
    presented in Figure 2 outlines a four-step process for conducting a sensitivity
    analysis of water distribution systems. A detailed description of each step is
    provided in the following sections. Figure 2. Flowchart of the methodology. 4.1.
    General Overview The aim of this research is to perform an extensive assessment
    of WDSs to prevent leakages effectively. This study meticulously scrutinizes the
    pipes and junctions, pinpointing them as pivotal elements prone to leaks. It delves
    into the critical facets of the system to uncover weaknesses and suggests proactive
    strategies for reducing water loss. The proposed methodology integrates the hydraulic
    measurements of a WDS with graph theory analytics. It thoroughly investigates
    pipe characteristics, such as length, diameter, flow rate, velocity, head loss,
    and volume. By applying graph theory, this study calculates edge betweenness centrality
    (see Definition 9) for pipes, providing insights into their significance in the
    network and aiding in bolstering the system’s integrity and reliability. Similarly,
    the research evaluates junction attributes, including elevation, demand, and pressure.
    It employs graph theory to derive three notable centrality measures: degree centrality
    (see Definition 6), closeness centrality (see Definition 7), and betweenness centrality
    (see Definition 8). These metrics are instrumental in gauging the importance of
    each junction within the network. The methodological approach is systematically
    organized into four key stages for both pipes and junctions (see Figure 2), which
    are described in the two following subsections. 4.2. Zonal Identification Process
    Our analytical process commences with the segmentation of the water distribution
    network into subgraphs or zones (see Definition 5). This segmentation is a strategic
    step to streamline both the examination and administration of water flow dynamics.
    We employ the k-means clustering algorithm for this segmentation, a widely used
    method for grouping data into clusters that minimize variance within each cluster
    and maximize variance between clusters [42]. Additionally, its scalability and
    adaptability make it suitable for water distribution networks of varying sizes
    and complexities [43]. K-means is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that is
    used to cluster our data into K number of clusters. Mathematically, it seeks to
    solve: min 𝑆 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑘 ∑ 𝑥∈ 𝑆 𝑖 ||𝑥− 𝜇 𝑖 || 2 (5) where, S represents the set of
    clusters 𝑆 1 , 𝑆 2 ,..., 𝑆 𝑘 . x is a data point belonging to cluster 𝑆 𝑖 . 𝜇
    𝑖 is the centroid of the points in 𝑆 𝑖 . To implement the k-means algorithm effectively,
    a pivotal preliminary step is to determine the ideal number of clusters. This
    decision is crucial as it influences the granularity and usefulness of the analysis.
    For this purpose, we apply the Elbow method. This method entails plotting the
    total within-cluster sum of squares (WSS) against the number of clusters. As we
    increment the number of clusters, the total WSS decreases. We look for a ‘knee’
    in the graph, which is the point at which the rate of decrease sharply changes,
    indicating that additional clusters will not significantly improve the partitioning.
    This point is known as the ‘elbow’, and the corresponding number of clusters is
    deemed optimal for our analysis. Once the optimal number of clusters is established,
    we can proceed with the k-means algorithm to create a zonal map of our network,
    facilitating targeted hydraulic analysis and efficient water distribution management.
    4.3. Parameters Scaling Procedure Following the zonal segmentation of the water
    distribution network, the second step in our methodology involves the normalization
    of parameters (hydraulic and centrality measures). This essential procedure equates
    disparate parameters, rendering them directly comparable by adjusting their values
    to a common scale [44]. Normalization is performed without altering the original
    data distribution or the relative standings of the values. Normalization or standardization
    helps to make data more adaptable [45,46]. Highly normalized data reduce the likelihood
    of inconsistencies, thereby decreasing the ambiguity of parameters. In this context,
    normalization adjusts the attributes of both pipes and junctions. For pipes, this
    may include parameters such as length, diameter, flow rate, velocity, head loss,
    volume, and edge betweenness centrality. For junctions, this could encompass elevation,
    demand, pressure, degree centrality, closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality.
    Specifically, normalization is applied to transform all parameter values to a
    uniform scale that ranges from 0 to 1. The normalization process is achieved by
    taking each parameter’s value 𝑥 𝑖 and subtracting the minimum value 𝑥 𝑚 𝑖𝑛 for
    that parameter across the network, then dividing by the range of the parameter
    values (the difference between the maximum 𝑥 𝑚 𝑎𝑥 and minimum 𝑥 𝑚 𝑖𝑛 values).
    This method, known as min–max scaling, allows for the different parameters to
    be evaluated on an equal footing. The normalization formula is articulated as
    follows: 𝑥 Norm = 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑥 min 𝑥 max − 𝑥 min (6) Through this formula, min–max
    scaling translates each parameter to a relative scale, facilitating a coherent
    and equitable comparison across the network’s diversified parameters. 4.4. Assigning
    Weights to Parameters In the third step of our approach, we enhance the analysis
    by assigning differential weights to each parameter, signifying their varying
    degrees of impact on the network’s susceptibility to leaks. To systematically
    quantify the importance of each parameter, we utilize the concept of entropy [47],
    which is a measure of uncertainty or disorder within a system. In this context,
    the application of entropy serves two primary purposes. Initially, it enables
    a quantitative differentiation among various parameters, emphasizing the ones
    with a substantial influence on the system’s behavior [48]. Parameters characterized
    by higher entropy values suggest more considerable variability, thereby being
    recognized as more impactful on the system’s overall state. Subsequently, entropy
    supports a weighted analytical approach. By attributing weights corresponding
    to the calculated entropy for each parameter, the methodology effectively incorporates
    the relative significance and influence of the parameters. Consequently, this
    method ensures that the analysis is detailed and specifically adapted to the unique
    dynamics of the system being analyzed. The application of entropy in the field
    of water distribution networks is pertinent, where the behavior of the system
    is influenced by a myriad of stochastic and dynamic parameters. The entropy-based
    weighting scheme allows for a more refined and targeted analysis, focusing on
    the parameters that truly drive system changes and thus enhancing the effectiveness
    of leak detection strategies [49,50]. The entropy H(X) of a parameter X is calculated
    by: 𝐻(𝑋)=− ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑃( 𝑥 𝑖 )log(𝑃( 𝑥 𝑖 )) (7) In this formula, 𝑃( 𝑥 𝑖 ) represents
    the probability of occurrence of the i-th value of the parameter X. This entropy-driven
    approach to weighting is particularly adept at reflecting the level of uncertainty
    or the lack of predictability associated with each parameter. It enables an insightful
    determination of which variables exert the most substantial influence on the network’s
    operational efficacy and robustness. 4.5. Sensitivity Index Computation The fourth
    and final step of our analysis involves computing the Sensitivity Index, denoted
    as S. This index is a weighted sum where each parameter value xi is multiplied
    by its corresponding weight 𝑊 𝑖 . The Sensitivity Index is thus the sum of these
    individual products across all parameters, formally expressed by the equation:
    𝑆= 𝑥 1 × 𝑤 1 + 𝑥 2 × 𝑤 2 +⋯+ 𝑥 𝑛 × 𝑤 𝑛 (8) In this formula, 𝑥 𝑖 represents the
    value of the ith parameter, and 𝑤 𝑖 signifies the weight assigned to that parameter,
    reflecting its relative importance in the calculation. The index n corresponds
    to the total number of parameters considered. The outcome, S, quantifies the overall
    sensitivity by aggregating the weighted contributions of each parameter, offering
    a singular measure that encapsulates the collective impact of all the parameters
    under investigation. The Sensitivity Index provides a comprehensive metric that
    can be used to prioritize maintenance and monitoring efforts, directing resources
    to the most critical areas of the network to mitigate the risk of leaks. 4.6.
    Theoretical Examination The primary purpose of this subsection is to illustrate
    the distinct steps of our proposal on a WDS Hanoi [51] composed of 31 nodes and
    34 edges (see Figure 3). Our methodology scrutinizes the network by assessing
    a range of parameters for pipes and junctions. As mentioned above, these parameters
    are crucial for evaluating the network’s performance and identifying key areas
    susceptible to leaks. Figure 3. Hanoi water distribution network. 1. Zonal Identification
    Process: At the outset of our analysis, we initiated the process with the Elbow
    method—a strategic approach to identifying the most suitable number of clusters
    for our dataset. As shown in Figure 4a, the number 3 emerges as the optimal number
    of clusters, as indicated by the ’elbow’ in the figure. After determining this,
    we apply the k-means clustering algorithm, which enables us to effectively partition
    the dataset into three coherent and distinct zones (green zone, red zone, and
    blue zone) (see Figure 4b). Figure 4. Zonal identification process step in the
    Hanoi water distribution network—(a): Elbow method analysis; (b): K-means clustering
    results. 2. Parameters Scaling Procedure: Upon identifying all of the distinct
    zones within the network, we advance to the pivotal normalization step. This process
    is essential as it uniformly scales all parameter values to a standard range between
    0 and 1. For this illustrative example, let us calculate the normalization value
    for the first pipe in the network. To achieve this, we will utilize min–max normalization
    for each parameter. If we denote L, D, F, V, H, Vol, and EB as the actual values
    for the length, diameter, flow, velocity, headloss, volume, and edge betweenness
    of the first pipe, and Lmin Lmin, Lmax Lmax, and so on as the minimum and maximum
    values for these parameters, based on Equation (6), the normalized values for
    all parameters would be calculated as: Normalized length = L−Lmin Lmax−Lmin =
    100−100 3500−100 =0 ; Normalized diameter = D−Dmin Dmax−Dmin = 1016−304.8 1016−304.8
    =1 ; Normalized flow = F−Fmin Fmax−Fmin = 5580.9−766.35 5588.9−766.35 =1 ; Normalized
    velocity = V−Vmin Vmax−Vmin = 6.831−0.0076 6.8319−0.0076 =1 ; Normalized headloss
    = H−Hmin Hmax−Hmin = 28.59−0 28.59−0 =1 ; Normalized volume = Vol−Volmin Volmax−Volmin
    = 81.073−10.944 2148.43−19.944 =0.032 ; Normalized edge betweenness = ED−EDmin
    EDmax−EDmin = 0.0625−0.0584 0.2883−0.0584 =0.015 . This normalization allows us
    to compare and analyze these parameters on an equal footing, as they are all rescaled
    to a uniform range, facilitating further steps such as weighting or sensitivity
    analysis. 3. Assigning Weights to Parameters: Upon establishing the seven critical
    parameters of the network—length, diameter, flow, velocity, headloss, volume,
    and edge betweenness—we embark on the task of allocating a distinctive weight
    to each. This allocation process utilizes the respective entropy values of these
    parameters as a foundation. To compute the entropy, we first calculate the probability
    distribution of each unique value within a parameter. For example, for the length
    parameter, we tally the frequency of each unique length measurement and normalize
    these frequencies to form a probability distribution: 𝑃( 𝑥 𝑖 )= Totalnumberofoccurrencesof
    𝑥 𝑖 Totalnumberofsamples (9) After that we calculate the entropy: 𝐻(𝑋)=− ∑ 𝑖=1
    𝑁 𝑃( 𝑥 𝑖 )log(𝑃( 𝑥 𝑖 )) (10) where H(X) is the Shannon entropy for the length
    values, 𝑃( 𝑥 𝑖 ) is the probability of each unique length, and N is the number
    of unique lengths. So, the entropy of each parameter is: Entropy length = 3.284;
    Entropy diameter = 3.141; Entropy flow = 3.232; Entropy velocity = 3.033; Entropy
    headloss = 3.295; Entropy volume = 3.287; Entropy edge betweenness = 3.022. After
    calculating the entropies for each parameter, the next step is to convert these
    entropy values into weights that can be used in our analysis. Transforming entropies
    into weights involves normalizing the entropy values to account for the number
    of unique values each parameter can take. This is performed using the concept
    of reduced entropy. The formula for reduced entropy ( 𝐻 𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑 ) is given by:
    𝐻 𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑 = 𝐸 log(𝑁) (11) where E is the entropy of a particular parameter, and
    N is the count of unique values that the parameter can take. Based on reduced
    entropy, we calculate the weight of each parameter using this formula: 𝑤 𝑖 = 1−
    𝐻 𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑 ( 𝑥 𝑖 ) 𝑚− ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 𝐻 𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑒𝑑 ( 𝑥 𝑖 ) (12) where m is the total number
    of parameters. The resulting weights are exemplified as: Weight length = 0.101;
    Weight diameter = 0.161; Weight flow = 0.123; Weight velocity = 0.206; Weight
    headloss = 0.097; Weight volume = 0.1; Weight edge betweenness = 0.211. 4. Sensitivity
    Index Computation: The Sensitivity Index Computation is the culmination of our
    methodological process where each parameter’s relative importance, as determined
    by the previously calculated weights, is utilized to quantify the network’s vulnerability
    to leaks. So, the Sensitivity Index for the first pipe is: 𝑆 1 =(0×0.101)+(1×0.161)+(0.999×0.123)+(0.999×0.206)+(1×0.097)+
    (0.032×0.1)+(0.015×0.211) Upon performing this calculation, the resultant Sensitivity
    Index for the first pipe is determined to be 0.59. This quantifies the combined
    effect of all weighted parameters for that specific pipe, providing a singular,
    comprehensive metric of its sensitivity. • Pipes’ Sensitivity Index interpretation:
    The Sensitivity Index calculated for each pipe in the network is visually represented
    on a graph, as shown in Figure 5a. This graph uses a color gradient to convey
    the relative sensitivity of each pipe segment within the network, with the progression
    from blue to red indicating an increase from low to high sensitivity. Figure 5.
    Graph visualizations of pipe and junction Sensitivity Indices in the Hanoi water
    distribution system—(a): pipes’ sensitivity analysis; (b): junctions’ sensitivity
    analysis. Notably, pipes within the green zone are distinguished as sensitive,
    denoting their strategic location adjacent to the reservoir. This is significant
    as these links serve as crucial conduits from the water source to the rest of
    the network, amplifying their importance. The sensitivity escalates for pipes
    that intersect the periphery of the green zone, transitioning into other areas,
    which indicates their critical role in maintaining the network’s integrity. Furthermore,
    the links bridging the green zone with other regions are inherently at risk, emphasizing
    the impact and importance of these transitional segments within the network’s
    hierarchy. • Junctions’ Sensitivity Index interpretation: Let us evaluate each
    junction within the network using the same methodology applied to the network’s
    pipes. We will maintain the existing zone divisions. The second phase involves
    normalization, where we apply the min–max normalization technique to the parameters
    of the junctions. This process adjusts elevation, demand, pressure, degree centrality,
    closeness centrality, and betweenness centrality values, scaling them to a range
    between 0 and 1. Subsequently, we will assign weights to each parameter to determine
    which factors most significantly impact the junctions and minimize water leakage
    in the network. After computing the weights for each parameter, we advance to
    calculating the Sensitivity Index for each network junction. As illustrated in
    Figure 5b, node colors represent the degree or the sensibility index; that is,
    the colors range from blue to red, representing a scale from low to high sensitivity.
    Blue sections describe areas assessed as safe, with a lower Sensitivity Index,
    while red sections highlight areas of higher sensitivity, suggesting potential
    concerns. Figure 5 illustrates the varying degrees of sensitivity across different
    junctions within the network. It is evident that junctions with multiple connecting
    nodes are identified as being more susceptible to water leakage. This observation
    is reasonable as these junctions are pivotal points within the network’s structure.
    5. Case Studies 5.1. Dataset Our experiments utilize four distinct WDSs: Balerma,
    ZJ, FossPoly 1, and L-Town. The characteristics of these WDSs are detailed in
    Table 1. Each WDS is represented by a directed graph. The directionality of the
    graph indicates the flow of water from sources to demand nodes under typical demand
    conditions. These conditions encompass average daily demands, peak demand periods,
    and minimum night-time flows to replicate a variety of operational scenarios.
    We conduct the simulations using the EPANET 2.2 software, accessed through the
    ’wntr’ Python package, which allows for the analysis of water flow and pressure
    in these directed networks. Table 1. The statistics of WDSs used in our experiments.
    5.2. Results: Sensitivity Index 5.2.1. Pipes’ Sensitivity Index Results In this
    subsection, we will discuss the results of the sensitivity analysis conducted
    on pipes. Figure 6 presents the outcomes derived from analyzing four WDSs. The
    color-coded links (pipes) in these figures are visual indicators of the Sensitivity
    Index assigned to each segment. The color spectrum ranges from soothing blue to
    attention-grabbing red, suggesting a continuum from low to high sensitivity. Within
    this color scheme, blue sections denote regions assessed as safe, characterized
    by a lower Sensitivity Index. Conversely, red sections highlight areas of heightened
    sensitivity, signaling potential concerns. Figure 6. Graph visualization of pipes’
    Sensitivity Index: (a) Balerma; (b) ZJ; (c) FossPoly 1 1; (d) L-Town (square is
    a reservoir). Figure 6a showcases the results of the sensitivity analysis conducted
    on the WDS of Balerma. The graph delineates three distinct zones identified through
    k-means clustering. Pipes adjacent to the reservoir are conspicuously marked in
    yellow, indicating their vulnerability to leaks. The connection between three
    specific zones is also highlighted as being at risk. Figure 6b pertains to WDS
    ZJ, where two zones are discerned. The blue zone is labeled as safe, with all
    pipes represented in blue. In contrast, the green zone exhibits a mix of green
    and yellow links, particularly those near the reservoir, suggesting heightened
    sensitivity in those areas. Moving on to Figure 6c, dedicated to the FossPoly
    1 WDS, three zones are identified. The blue zone exhibits links between red and
    yellow, signifying its sensitivity, especially considering its proximity to the
    reservoir. Inter-zone risks are also evident, while the red and green zones are
    deemed safe due to the prevalence of links exclusively in green and blue. Lastly,
    in Figure 6d, we observe the L-Town WDS segmented into three unique zones. Each
    zone is characterized by specific features and vulnerabilities. Similar to other
    networks, the links adjacent to the reservoir in this WDS are more susceptible
    to leaks. However, the distinctive aspect of this particular network is its elongated
    structure, which suggests that there may be numerous at-risk links scattered throughout.
    This network’s extended configuration means that the betweenness measure becomes
    especially pertinent. It is likely that the links with higher betweenness scores
    are those that serve as critical pathways for water delivery. These links, often
    functioning as bridges on the shortest path between two nodes, are integral to
    the network’s efficiency and reliability. If these links were to fail or leak,
    the impact could be significant, potentially disrupting service to large segments
    of the network. Therefore, regular monitoring of these high-betweenness links
    is essential for leak detection and prompt maintenance. By proactively identifying
    and addressing vulnerabilities in these critical areas, the network’s overall
    resilience can be enhanced, ensuring consistent water supply and minimizing the
    risk of large-scale service interruptions. Figure 7 illustrates the significance
    of various parameters within five WDSs. The figure effectively highlights the
    importance of each parameter: Figure 7. The impact of pipes’ parameters on water
    distribution systems’ performance. 1. Length: It holds moderate importance in
    most networks but is least important in L-Town, where the pipe lengths are very
    close. 2. Diameter: This parameter is crucial in Balerma due to the variance of
    pipe diameter, whereas its importance varies in other networks. 3. Flow: In FossPoly
    1 and Hanoi, the flow’s importance is markedly high, suggesting that it is a crucial
    parameter for the networks’ operation. 4. Volume: The high importance of volume
    in FossPoly 1 suggests an emphasis on storage capacity within the network. 5.
    Edge Betweenness: The prominence of edge betweenness in L-Town could indicate
    a focus on network connectivity or the diversity of paths because L-Town is a
    larger graph. 6. Velocity: In ZJ, velocity is notably essential, pointing to a
    prioritization of water delivery speed or system dynamics. 7. Head Loss: The high
    importance of head loss in ZJ reflects the network’s susceptibility to pressure
    drops or its emphasis on energy efficiency. 5.2.2. Junctions’ Sensitivity Index
    Results In this subsection, we will discuss the sensitivity analysis results conducted
    on junctions. Figure 8 illustrates the results from analyzing four WDSs. In these
    figures, the nodes’ colors range from red to blue, representing each junction’s
    Sensitivity Index, with the colors’ intensities reflecting their susceptibility
    to leak detection. Figure 8. Graph visualization of junctions’ Sensitivity Index:
    (a) Balerma; (b) ZJ; (c) FossPoly 1; (d) L-Town. Figure 8a shows the Sensitivity
    Index outcomes for the Balerma WDS. The red zone contains two water reservoirs,
    and it is observed that the majority of nodes fall within the orange, yellow,
    and green spectrum, logically indicating proximity to the water source, which
    is inherently more susceptible to leaks. Notably, nodes that serve as bridges
    with multiple connections to other nodes are also marked as high-risk. This highlights
    the significance of centrality measures in identifying areas within the network
    that are most vulnerable to leakage. Figure 8b presents the Sensitivity Index
    results of ZJ WDS. Most nodes within the green zones range between green and yellow,
    while the red node represents the reservoir. This indicates that this area is
    at risk as it contains the water source for the entire network. Figure 8c focuses
    on the FossPoly 1 WDS. Similar to previous observations, the red node represents
    a reservoir with a higher risk of leakage. Additionally, the four yellow nodes,
    characterized by their numerous connections to other nodes, are also identified
    as potential high-risk points for leakage. Lastly, we examine the L-Town WDS in
    Figure 8d. As with other networks, nodes representing reservoirs are sensitive
    to leakage. Unlike other WDSs, we also observe that the three zones contain nodes
    with varied colors, indicating a high degree of connectivity due to the network’s
    extensive length. This suggests that this system is particularly vulnerable to
    leaks. These findings highlight the importance of centrality measures—degree,
    betweenness, and closeness—in identifying sensitive zones within WDS for leak
    detection. Junctions with high betweenness centrality are pivotal for water flow,
    as they serve as crucial conduits across the network. Those with a high degree
    of centrality will likely be distribution hubs, directly impacting the network’s
    redundancy and resilience. Additionally, junctions with high closeness centrality
    are strategically crucial for efficient water distribution, minimizing the distance
    that water must travel to reach all points in the system, which could be critical
    in the event of a leak. Figure 9 illustrates the weights of various parameters
    across five different water distribution networks. The figure effectively highlights
    the importance of each parameter: Figure 9. The impact of junctions’ parameters
    on water distribution systems’ performance. 1. Elevation: This parameter seems
    moderately to highly important in Balerma and FossPoly 1 but less significant
    in Hanoi, ZJ, and L-Town due to the same values of elevation of the junctions
    within networks. 2. Demand: Demand holds varying weights across the networks,
    being most significant in FossPoly 1 and least in L-Town. 3. Pressure: Pressure
    is essential in ZJ and Hanoi, indicating that the networks’ performance is sensitive
    to pressure variations. 4. Degree Centrality: Degree centrality has a substantial
    weight in Balerma, suggesting that the number of immediate connections to a node
    is a significant factor in this network. 5. Closeness Centrality: FossPoly 1 WDS
    presents a higher weight for closeness centrality, implying that the efficiency
    of water distribution to any given node is a priority for this network. 6. Betweenness
    Centrality: Betweenness centrality has an essential weight in all networks, indicating
    that controlling the flow through nodes that act as bridges within networks is
    a critical aspect of its design and functionality. 5.3. Validation of Sensitivity
    Index Using Historical Data from L-Town WDS The validation of the obtained results
    of the Sensitivity Index was conducted using the L-Town WDS as a case study, given
    the availability of detailed historical leakage records. The objective was to
    establish a correlation between the Sensitivity Index values assigned to different
    nodes within the network and the actual occurrence of leakages over a period of
    two years. By establishing this, we aimed to determine the index’s ability to
    identify nodes that are more vulnerable to leakages and thus validate its practical
    utility. Historical data have been analyzed to calculate leakage frequencies at
    each node, providing a quantitative basis for assessing network sensitivity. These
    frequencies have been normalized to a range from 0 to 1 to align with the Sensitivity
    Index values, allowing direct comparison. The normalized leakage frequency represents
    the proportion of time each node has experienced leakage, providing a consistent
    measure for comparison across the network. We employed Spearman’s rank correlation
    coefficient (SCC) to evaluate the association between the nodes’ Sensitivity Index
    and their normalized leakage frequency. SCC is a non-parametric measure used to
    assess the strength and direction of a monotonic relationship between two variables.
    It determines the extent to which a monotonic function can represent the association
    between variables [56]. 𝑆𝐶𝐶=1− 6 ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 𝑑 2 𝑖 𝑛( 𝑛 2 −1) (13) where 𝑑 𝑖 is the
    difference between the ranks of the corresponding values 𝑋 𝑖 and 𝑌 𝑖 . As a result,
    the analysis revealed a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient of 0.6358, which
    signifies a strong and statistically significant positive relationship. This robust
    correlation coefficient not only underscores the validity of the Sensitivity Index
    but also indicates its substantial predictive capability. Moreover, the results
    confirm that nodes with a higher Sensitivity Index are indeed more likely to experience
    leakages. As depicted in Figure 10, the kernel density plot visually represents
    this correlation between the nodes’ Sensitivity Index and the normalized leakage
    frequency. This pattern solidifies the reliability of the Sensitivity Index as
    an effective indicator for pinpointing likely sites of leakage within the WDS.
    Consequently, this index emerges as an instrumental asset in guiding maintenance
    and remedial actions, enabling the strategic allocation of resources to areas
    demonstrably more prone to leakage incidents. Figure 10. Kernel density estimate
    plot showing the correlation between the nodes’ Sensitivity Index and normalized
    leakage frequency. The evidence provided by the historical data of L-Town WDS
    affirms that the Sensitivity Index can effectively stratify network components
    based on their vulnerability to leakages. This stratification facilitates a more
    informed approach to resource allocation, enabling water utilities to optimize
    their operational and maintenance strategies for enhanced resilience of the WDS.
    6. Practical Implications of Findings The sensitivity analysis conducted on pipes
    and junctions within various water distribution systems has yielded insights with
    significant implications for water management and infrastructure enhancement.
    In the following section, some practical implications of the proposed method are
    presented: Targeted Maintenance and Repair: Sensitivity analysis identifies the
    most vulnerable points in the network where leaks are likely to appear. This enables
    maintenance and repairs to be targeted, giving priority to zones requiring more
    immediate attention, thus reducing downtime and maintenance costs [57,58]. Optimal
    Sensor Placement: Sensitivity analysis identifies the most critical points in
    the water distribution network. By understanding where the network is most vulnerable,
    utilities can strategically place sensors (pressure, acoustic, …) where they are
    most needed to effectively detect leaks [59]. Water Conservation: Sensitivity
    analysis can help achieve significant water savings by enabling early detection
    and repair of leaks. This is crucial in regions facing water shortages and can
    contribute to broader water conservation and sustainable development objectives
    [60,61]. Energy and Cost Savings: Detecting and repairing leaks quickly saves
    both energy and money. Less water loss means less water to treat and distribute,
    which reduces the water distribution system’s energy footprint and operating costs
    [62]. Environmental Benefits: Reducing leakage and improving the efficiency of
    water systems can reduce their impact on the environment. This includes reducing
    water wastage, energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions associated with
    water treatment and distribution [63]. 7. Summary and Conclusions Water distribution
    systems are inherently complex and diverse. The literature on WDS often overlooks
    the critical role of pipe network topology and its influence on performance concerning
    both hydraulic functionality and water quality [64,65]. we have addressed a significant
    gap in the literature and highlighted key areas for improving system resilience
    and efficiency. Our analysis revealed several key findings: Pipe Characteristics
    and System Performance: Analysis of pipe networks reveals the nuanced impact of
    hydraulic parameters on system performance. Pipe length is typically of moderate
    importance, with uniformity in some systems negating its influence. Larger diameters
    are pivotal for accommodating high flow volumes at lower velocities, Ismaeel and
    Zayed, in their paper [65], indicate that the main indicator contributing to the
    performance of pipes is the diameter of pipe, underscoring his critical role in
    the overall effectiveness and reliability of the pipe network. In this study,
    we note that larger diameters often correlate with higher edge betweenness centrality,
    reflecting their crucial role in network flow. Similarly, pipes characterized
    by high flow are integral to the network, indicated by their high edge betweenness,
    and are thus focal points for leak detection efforts to preserve network integrity.
    Additionally, pipes with substantial volume capacities are essential during peak
    demand, while excessive velocities may signal critical throughput but risk infrastructure
    damage and inefficiency. Furthermore, the pronounced head loss could highlight
    pipes that are long or of a smaller diameter, potentially reducing their edge
    betweenness if more efficient alternatives are available. Node Analysis for Leak
    Detection: In the context of leak detection, node analysis reveals potential correlations
    between hydraulic measures and graph theory metrics. A junction’s elevation can
    affect the hydraulic pressure due to gravitational forces. High-demand nodes are
    often characterized by greater centrality, requiring connections to multiple pipes
    for sufficient water supply. Such nodes may also exhibit elevated betweenness
    centrality, indicating their importance in the distribution network. Conversely,
    closeness centrality might decrease if a node is strategically positioned near
    others to meet its high demand efficiently. Nodes experiencing higher pressure
    are likely to be pivotal in directing flow, reflecting increased degree and betweenness
    centrality while also demonstrating higher closeness centrality due to their strategic
    location for effective distribution. These interdependencies between a node’s
    physical characteristics and network centrality underscore the complex dynamics
    that shape a water distribution system’s topology. To utilize these insights for
    leak detection, precise network modeling and comprehensive analysis are essential
    to determine the exact relationships within a specific system. In summarizing
    these key findings, our study provides substantial evidence of the significant
    potential for enhancing the operational efficiency and resilience of WDSs. By
    mapping network topology to a graph, these metrics can pinpoint critical nodes
    and links, assess the impact of component failures, and identify areas with high
    leak probability, thus providing a strategic approach to monitoring and maintenance
    for enhanced system resilience. However, this study has certain limitations. The
    Sensitivity Index developed is based on a static snapshot of the system and does
    not account for temporal variations in demand and supply, which can alter flow
    dynamics and the importance of certain pipes and junctions. In future research,
    we will aim to integrate real-time data for dynamic analysis, apply the findings
    across various WDS configurations for broader validation, and develop algorithms
    that adapt to changes within the network to refine leak prediction and system
    resilience. Further exploring how these metrics can aid other WDS management aspects
    could also yield significant benefits. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

  description: In the fast-moving world of information and communications technologies,
    one significant issue in metropolitan cities is water scarcity and the need for
    an intelligent water distribution system for sustainable water management. An
    IoT-based monitoring system can improve water distribution system management and
    mitigate challenges in the distribution network networks such as leakage, breakage,
    theft, overflow, dry running of pumps and so on. However, the increase in the
    number of communication and sensing devices within smart cities has evoked challenges
    to existing communication networks due to the increase in delay and energy consumption
    within the network. The work presents different strategies for efficient delay
    and energy offloading in IoT-integrated water distribution systems in smart cities.
    Different IoT-enabled communication network topology diagrams are proposed, considering
    the different water network design parameters, land cover patterns and wireless
    channels for communication. From these topologies and by considering all the relevant
    communication parameters, the optimum communication network architecture to continuously
    monitor a water distribution network in a metropolitan city in India is identified.
    As a case study, an IoT design and analysis model is studied for a secondary metropolitan
    city in India. The selected study area is in Kochi, India. Based on the site-specific
    model and land use and land cover pattern, delay and energy modeling of the IoT-based
    water distribution system is discussed. Algorithms for node categorisation and
    edge-to-fog allocation are discussed, and numerical analyses of delay and energy
    models are included. An approximation of the delay and energy of the network is
    calculated using these models. On the basis of these study results, and state
    transition diagrams, the optimum placement of fog nodes linked with edge nodes
    and a cloud server could be carried out. Also, by considering different scenarios,
    up to a 40% improvement in energy efficiency can be achieved by incorporating
    a greater number of states in the state transition diagram. These strategies could
    be utilized in implementing delay and energy-efficient IoT-enabled communication
    networks for site-specific applications.

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract In the fast-moving world of information and communications
    technologies, one significant issue in metropolitan cities is water scarcity and
    the need for an intelligent water distribution system for sustainable water management.
    An IoT-based monitoring system can improve water distribution system management
    and mitigate challenges in the distribution network networks such as leakage,
    breakage, theft, overflow, dry running of pumps and so on. However, the increase
    in the number of communication and sensing devices within smart cities has evoked
    challenges to existing communication networks due to the increase in delay and
    energy consumption within the network. The work presents different strategies
    for efficient delay and energy offloading in IoT-integrated water distribution
    systems in smart cities. Different IoT-enabled communication network topology
    diagrams are proposed, considering the different water network design parameters,
    land cover patterns and wireless channels for communication. From these topologies
    and by considering all the relevant communication parameters, the optimum communication
    network architecture to continuously monitor a water distribution network in a
    metropolitan city in India is identified. As a case study, an IoT design and analysis
    model is studied for a secondary metropolitan city in India. The selected study
    area is in Kochi, India. Based on the site-specific model and land use and land
    cover pattern, delay and energy modeling of the IoT-based water distribution system
    is discussed. Algorithms for node categorisation and edge-to-fog allocation are
    discussed, and numerical analyses of delay and energy models are included. An
    approximation of the delay and energy of the network is calculated using these
    models. On the basis of these study results, and state transition diagrams, the
    optimum placement of fog nodes linked with edge nodes and a cloud server could
    be carried out. Also, by considering different scenarios, up to a 40% improvement
    in energy efficiency can be achieved by incorporating a greater number of states
    in the state transition diagram. These strategies could be utilized in implementing
    delay and energy-efficient IoT-enabled communication networks for site-specific
    applications. Keywords: delay minimization; energy minimization; Internet of Things
    (IoT); network architecture; wireless communication 1. Introduction Sufficient
    water for daily activities is vital for cities and societies. Water requirements
    can be fulfilled only by the accurate delivery of adequate water at different
    locations within an area from the central water distribution point [1]. This accurate
    delivery of water in cities can be assured by the close surge monitoring of different
    parameters, such as water flow, water pressure, water level and water quality
    at various locations [2]. A Water Distribution System (WDS) is a spatially organized
    networks that ensures safe water access to the people/community, and consists
    of water resources, conveyance systems, treatment plants, distribution networks,
    and consumers. Water intake to the source and water withdrawal from the source
    are followed by the transmission systems, which convey raw water from the collection
    unit to the treatment unit. Water treatment is carried out at water treatment
    plants (WTP). The next process consists of distributing the treated water to consumers
    through pipe networks. These networks consist of pipes, valves, appurtenances,
    pumps, storage structures and other supporting infrastructure. Wastewater from
    consumers can be treated and recycled. The IoT-enabled smart management of water
    distribution systems can ensure the delivery of water in equal quantities at all
    targeted destinations, thus fulfilling the needs of all consumers within a location
    [3,4]. IoT-based communication systems for cities can provide wireless connectivity
    to all the devices within the network [5,6,7]. Even though IoT-based systems have
    the above capabilities, they also have significant challenges, some of which are
    as follows. IoT systems deal with enormous amounts of data in M2M and device-to-device
    communications [8]. The timely management of both edge, fog, and cloud nodes without
    delay in communications can be challenging as network resources are subject to
    various constraints [9,10,11]. Ensuring the interoperability of APIs and web services,
    including the mini, micro, and macro communication management of edge, fog, and
    cloud nodes, respectively, is a challenging task. Security concerns, such as confidentiality/privacy,
    integrity, authenticity, non-repudiation, and authorization [12,13] have to be
    achieved in the network for secure communications. Network reliability is one
    of the critical requirements for IoT deployment with moderate-to-high-priority
    data. Hence, heterogeneity in terms of data, design, and operation has to be ensured
    [14]. Low latency and high accuracy are requirements in IoT-based water distribution
    systems for smart cities [15,16]. IoT-enabled water distribution systems aim to
    provide smart communications between different IoT modules deployed within water
    distribution networks in smart cities [17,18]. The sources of water networks in
    most cities in India are freshwater reservoirs, such as lakes, ponds, and backwaters.
    Water is collected from reservoirs and distributed to the lower levels, i.e.,
    consumer points such as households, industries, and offices. Water scarcity at
    specific locations is a significant concern in these networks due to the lack
    of efficient water management [19]. IoT-enabled smart water systems can improve
    water distribution management. However, to deploy an efficient system, a wireless
    propagation model suitable for the location depending upon the terrain has to
    be found using the land cover pattern [20]. In this work, the significant constraints
    that lead to inefficiency in water management are addressed, and a solution is
    proposed by deploying different sensor modules depending on the constraints. The
    deployed sensors are either active or passive and are either directly or indirectly
    connected with water distribution entities, such as pipes, pumps, and valves.
    Currently, all mobile communication networks within India are 4G/5G, and this
    work utilizes these protocols for communication between the different modules
    within the network. The IoT network in this work consists of three types of nodes:
    edge, fog, and cloud. The sensors integrated with the communication module form
    the edge devices. The unit responsible for intermediate data collection, processing,
    and re-transmission are the fog devices, and the final data reception, processing,
    and control take place within the cloud devices. The IoT devices in water distribution
    systems are often constrained by limited power resources, which must be addressed
    by energy-efficient offloading strategies that minimize energy consumption for
    the deployed devices. Offloading data to cloud or edge servers introduces network
    latency within the network, which can be addressed by developing techniques to
    minimize delay in the network while maintaining reliable communication depending
    upon the study area. A multi-layer heterogeneous IoT architecture for delay and
    energy-efficient offloading strategies in an integrated water distribution system
    is to be designed considering the above challenges [21]. The architecture should
    be designed to optimize the use of resources while minimizing delay and energy
    use, thus improving the overall efficiency of the water distribution system. Integrating
    IoT technologies into water distribution systems in smart cities introduces challenges
    related to delay and energy efficiency, demanding the design of a robust multi-layer
    heterogeneous IoT architecture. From the above research challenges, it is evident
    that the current state of water distribution systems lacks an optimized framework
    capable of efficiently managing heterogeneous IoT devices, minimizing end-to-end
    delays, and ensuring energy-efficient offloading strategies. Hence, the objective
    of this work is to design an IoT-based delay and energy-efficient offloading framework
    for the current water distribution system by considering the research mentioned
    above challenges. To our knowledge, the design and analysis framework for any
    site-specific IoT-based communication network for the optimized delay-efficient
    and energy-efficient offloading strategies is not available in the literature.
    This modeling framework can be universally applicable for designing any site-specific
    communication network, which is novel in our work. Identified the different challenges
    of a WDN in a secondary metropolitan city and designed communication network entities
    and topologies. Development of wireless propagation model for a specific study

    distribution networks for smart cities. The problems discussed in the paper focus
    on the strategies to overcome the delay and energy problems in the communication
    network, thereby ensuring increased lifetime to the different IoT nodes. The work

    Network in the study area. Section 5 discusses the algorithms performed in the

    2. Design Considerations for an IoT-Enabled WDN In India, even though there are
    adequate water resources for sustainable water distribution, some places lack
    water, even for their primary necessities. Water from water sources will be collected
    in large reservoirs, from where it is supplied through the distribution network
    to consumer connections. Figure 1 shows the high-level water supply system. WDN
    consists of 5 layers: consumers, consumer supply point, sub-reservoir, treatment
    plant, and main water reservoir. Figure 1. The Generic Water Distribution Network.
    The water supply shortage is the lack of a proper reservoir distribution system.
    This includes the aging of infrastructure, leakages, and poor water management
    of the network. To mitigate these challenges, a smart IoT-based water distribution
    system for sustainable water management is proposed. The IoT-based water distribution
    network can monitor, control, and automate the WDN, enhancing water management
    for the community and the water supply. The distribution system can be represented
    as a multi-layer heterogeneous IoT architecture with multiple entities for this
    solution. Table 1 shows the different entities considered in designing the network.
    Table 1. Water distribution entities. Different design constraints must be considered
    for the efficient formulation of the architecture. The different design constraints
    considered in deriving the multi-layer heterogeneous IoT architecture are as follows.
    2.1. Water Supply-Consumption Imbalance The water from the reservoirs is collected
    at the sub-reservoirs after treatment. Water is distributed from the sub-reservoirs
    through the junctions to the consumer points. Even though there is a proper hierarchical
    plan for efficient distribution, some areas need more water for basic needs due
    to water leakage, illegal connections, water theft, etc. The supply-consumption
    imbalance can be identified by placing flow sensors at each level. The flow sensors
    are to be placed at level 1 and level 5 of the water distribution network. The
    placement of flow monitoring sensors at each level with a controller is shown
    in Figure 2a. Figure 2. Sensors in Water Distribution Network for monitoring (a)
    Flow (b) Level (c) Quality (d) Pressure. 2.2. Sub-Optimal Faults from the Operator
    Side The operators currently do the water tank filling and operations like switching
    on and off the pumps and valves. So, by mistake or for unavoidable reasons, sub-optimal
    faults occur in the operation of tanks. Introducing a water level sensing system
    in the network can avoid or control these faults. The sensor could detect the
    tank’s water level and automatically turn the pump on and off upon filling the
    tank. The system could save water and electricity, thus ensuring optimized energy
    consumption. The level sensors have to be deployed in levels 1, 3, and 4 of the
    water distribution network. The placement of level monitoring sensors at each
    level with a controller is shown in Figure 2b. 2.3. Water Quality Analysis After
    treatment, the water from the reservoirs is stored in the tank and further distributed
    to the lower levels. Water quality is the primary concern to be considered, as
    it could contribute to many health issues. As water is supplied from the primary
    source to a community, the health effects of water intake with chemical contents
    can lead to long-lasting problems for the community. So, water quality has to
    be analyzed before storing it in the tanks using water quality sensors. The quality
    monitoring sensors must be deployed in levels 1 and 5 of the water distribution
    network. The placement of quality monitoring sensors at each level with a controller
    is shown in Figure 2c. 2.4. Pipe Line Water Theft Detection Even though all the
    line connections and the water usage are manually monitored, water theft is due
    to illegal connections. These illegal connections and water thefts can affect
    the whole network. Due to this issue, some locations will need more water for
    their amenities. This water theft can be detected by deploying pressure sensors
    at the junctions, and the increased pressure in supply for the allotted connections
    will indicate water theft. The pressure monitoring sensors must be deployed at
    all levels of the water distribution network. The placement of pressure monitoring
    sensors at each level with a controller is shown in Figure 2d. 2.5. Automatic
    Fault Pipe Detection One of the main reasons for the water supply-consumption
    imbalance is the fault in the pipes. This fault can be detected by using crack
    detection sensors. Thus, maintaining cracks in the pipes can resolve the water
    leakage within the pipes. 2.6. Automatic Billing System Using the cumulative data
    from the flow sensor from each consumer point, the bill details of the consumers
    can be calculated and updated for the users. 2.7. Optimised Water Distribution
    The enhancement of all these sensors in the water distribution network will resolve
    the presently sustaining issues and contribute to sustainable water distribution
    within the network. 3. IoT-Enabled Water Distribution Network In order to address
    the design constraints in the water distribution system, the different sensors
    have to be deployed in respective locations where sensing is mandatory, and the
    Smart IoT connects all these sensors-enabled networks. The network comprises sensors,
    IoT gateway, cloud, analytics, and user interface. The sensors, like pressure,
    level, and flow sensors, will provide analog or digital data and are connected
    to the IoT gateway module, which transmits the collected data to the cloud via
    4G connectivity. The data is further analyzed and is available to the user interface.
    The requirement is to transmit the pressure, flow, and level data collected by
    the sensor units to the cloud. Assume there are ‘N’ random underground pipeline
    points deployed by the flow and pressure sensors. The cloud or the monitoring
    point is located at a different location, too far away from the sensors. These
    sensors will send the data to the monitoring point with the gateway module. For
    the reliable and efficient transmission of the collected data, a study of the
    different ways of transmission of the data from the sensor unit to the control
    unit has been done. These details are described in detail in the below sections.
    The lower level of the network consists of different sensor nodes like pressure
    monitoring sensor (PMS), level monitoring sensor (LMS), flow monitoring sensor
    (FMS) and different quality monitoring sensors (QMS). The explanation about the
    various sensor nodes is explained in detail below: PMS: The pressure sensors are
    deployed underground beneath the pipe to continuously monitor water pressure.
    FMS: The flow sensors are also deployed underground beneath the pipe to continuously
    monitor water pressure. LMS: The level sensors are deployed in the water tanks
    in the main water collection point to know the quantity of water available in
    the tank. QMS: QMS consists of sensors for water quality monitoring. Various water
    quality parameters such as pH, iron, fluoride, and calcium content in water can
    be monitored by deploying the corresponding sensors in the locations or water
    outlets. All these sensors are integrated with the microcontrollers, which transmit
    the data to the gateway using 4G connectivity. The real-time monitoring and automation
    system of the WDN mainly requires three types of nodes: edge node, fog node, and
    cloud. The edge node performs the data acquisition and edge computing and forwards
    to the fog node, which acts as the remote control station for this communication
    network. The fog node acts as the repeater and network controller in the network.
    The fog node need not be in the communication range of all the edge nodes. Hence,
    fog nodes have to forward the data to the cloud. The fog nodes must be aligned
    on multiple levels for redundant communication. The high-level IoT architecture
    consists of different levels termed edge node, fog node, and cloud server. The
    edge node comprises different sensor units integrated with the microcontroller
    and communication module. The data aggregated from the sensor units is transmitted
    to the higher levels called fog nodes. The application part of the hierarchy is
    the cloud server. A detailed explanation of the different nodes is described in
    detail in the sections below. 3.1. Edge Node The data collected from the different
    sensors are computed and abstracted and are transmitted to the next higher level
    - the fog node. 3.2. Fog Node The data sent from the edge nodes after data abstraction
    are received by the multiple fog nodes location-wise. The received data is abstracted
    and aggregated using multiple computations and sent to the cloud server. 3.3.
    Cloud Server The top layer of the IoT communication network is the cloud server.
    The cloud nodes receive the data transmitted by the multiple fog nodes after fog
    computation. The cloud server consists of a high-level visualization platform
    enabled to predict, analyze, and fault detect the water network in the location.
    The cloud is enabled with behavioral modeling and demand forecasting with the
    help of a machine learning framework. This is the generic overview of the water
    distribution network. In order to attain an IoT network for WDN, a proper communication
    channel with efficient data transmission has to be made available between the
    transmitter and receiver. For that, within the study area, the wireless propagation
    models have to be identified, and the strategies for reducing the delay and energy
    of the network have to be identified. The practical aspects of designing an ideal
    IoT-enabled communication network with minimized delay and energy considering
    the location properties, including the wireless propagation model and challenges,
    are discussed in the next section. 4. Case Study: Designing of IoT-Enabled Water
    Distribution Network in the Study Area The design of an IoT-enabled WDN with minimized
    delay and energy has to be initiated with a geographical understanding of the
    study area. Based on the geographical model, the wireless communication model
    for the study area could be predicted, which is highly necessary in designing
    the IoT network. The results of channel modeling can be used to minimize the delay
    and energy of the network. A detailed explanation is given in the below subsections.
    4.1. Study Area As per the 2011 census, Kochi Municipal Corporation caters to
    the needs of 677,381  citizens, an area of 94.88 sq. km, and 74 wards. Over the
    years, the population growth rate has tremendously increased due to the significant
    rate of urbanization [22]. Within the domains of sustainability, a creative city
    is made of several defined characteristics, one of which is the environment. This
    includes clean air, water, sanitation, green spaces, and recreational areas. It
    is vital to upgrade and modernize the water supply system, promote rainwater harvesting,
    minimize water use, reuse water as far as possible, and ensure that water leakages
    are detected and repaired immediately. Kochi has already prepared a water policy.
    It is the first initiative by a local self-government body in India [23]. The
    study area Kochi is depicted in Figure 3 and Figure 4. Figure 3. Study area (a)
    India (b) Kochi. Figure 4. Land cover classification of the study area. The water
    supply distribution system in Kochi faces several challenges, such as non-availability
    of 24/7 water supply, uneven and intermittent supply, lack of sewage treatment
    plants, depleting groundwater quantity and quality, population growth, water pollution,
    changing land use patterns, low multi-hazard resilience for water management,
    and non-availability of climate based forecast models for water quantity and quality
    management [24]. Even though these are the generic WDN supply challenges, the
    predominant problem with the Edakochi water distribution network is the age of
    the infrastructure. Since the supply mains had been laid more than 40 years ago,
    and new constructions and buildings upon the mains, the information on the larger
    pipes is mostly unknown. The lack of pipe mains accessibility and data availability
    is due to urbanization, dense population, and built-up areas. A communication
    architecture for the IoT-enabled WDN will address all these challenges. Since
    in Kochi, most of the population depends on the pipeline water supply, infrastructure
    is a high priority. Hence, any information on the supply network at any point
    is critical. Therefore, the communication network has to be delay-tolerant. The
    WDN branches were laid based on urbanization rather than optimized and expertise
    design and planning. Hence, there are more interconnections and junctions in the
    Kochi WDN. Hence, the number of edge nodes is also high. Therefore, an optimized
    energy communication network is required for the area. A delay and energy-efficient
    IoT-enabled water distribution network controlling and monitoring system can rectify
    most of the challenges. 4.2. Site Specific Propagation Model Selection Criteria
    In this section, we identify the communication model for the IoT-enabled water
    distribution system for Kochi. Kochi is the suburban city of Kerala, which contains
    variable land use patterns. The pattern contains vegetation and built-ups such
    as small and tall buildings, metro rails, and roads. The success rate of the IoT
    communication system for the WDN depends on the path loss model chosen for the
    area. Free-space loss, refraction, diffraction, reflection, aperture medium coupling
    loss, and absorption are some causes of path loss. Terrain contours, environment,
    propagation medium, the distance between the transmitter and the receiver, and
    the height and location of antennas also influence path loss. The land cover of
    the study area was identified and analyzed in QGIS with the open-source plugin
    Semi-Automatic Classification (SCP) [25]. It enables supervised land cover classification
    of remote sensing images by downloading free image files from satellites such
    as LANDSAT and Sentinel and performing prepossessing and post-processing functionalities.
    Multi-spectral images are processed to produce the land cover classification.
    SCP was performed on the images downloaded from LANDSAT for January 2021. Tonal
    and textural variations due to altitude-dependent vegetation and contour information
    are used for classification. The image was processed to classify the different
    features on the ground, such as built-up, vegetation, and water. For supervised
    classification using the maximum likelihood supervised classification (MLC) algorithm,
    training sets were selected in the LANDSAT imagery with seven bands based on the
    collected sample points for respective LULC classes. Training sites for LULC classification
    were selected based on knowledge developed through extensive ground surveys and
    detailed field studies of the area. Figure 4 shows the LULC classification of
    the study area. The built-up areas are a unique urban land use pattern covering
    the entire Kochi. It consists of three different urban classes outlining different
    settlement geometries, densities, and special urban zones such as trade fairs
    or industrial areas [26]. From the land cover model, it is evident that the area
    consists of both vegetation, water, and built-up. As Ernakulam comprises cities
    and villages, the propagation model should satisfy the criteria for urban, suburban,
    and rural area propagation effects [27]. The types of propagation models and their
    characteristics are shown in Table 2. The development of graphical information
    systems, which index data of terrain, clutter, and land usage in an easily accessible
    and manipulated form, giving better frequency and management [28]. The propagation
    model characterizes how radio propagation affects the environment of the receiver.
    The Fris transmission equation governs radio propagation between a transmitting
    antenna and a receiving antenna [29], 𝑃 𝑟 = 𝑃 𝑡 𝐺 𝑡 𝐺 𝑟 𝜆 2 (4𝜋) 2 𝑑 2 𝐿 (1) where,
    𝑃 𝑡 is transmitting power, 𝐺 𝑡 is the gain of transmitting antenna, 𝐺 𝑟 is the
    gain of the receiving antenna, 𝜆 is the operating wavelength, d is the distance
    between transmitting and receiving antennas and L is the transmission loss. Table
    2. Propagation models and their parameters. Free-space transmission loss (FSTL)
    [30,31], 𝐹𝑆𝑇𝐿= (4𝜋𝑑) 2 𝜆 2 (2) rearranging terms and putting FSTL in decibels
    (dB), 𝐹𝑆𝑇𝐿=32.4+20 log 10 𝑓 𝑀𝐻𝑧 +20 log 10 𝑑 𝑘𝑚 (3) The FSTL is the primary line
    of sight propagation model, which depends only on the distance. It is considered
    the best-case propagation model. It does not account for multipath or ground clutter
    loss from foliage, buildings, clutter, and so on. Therefore, FSTL will not be
    suitable for the study area as per the land cover classification (see Figure 4).
    The next is the Hata-Okumura model, which has additional loss factors for different
    built-up densities. It has three different equations for urban, suburban, and
    rural environments—the model constraints on distance and frequency. For Sub-urban
    environments [32] 𝐿 𝑈 =69.55+26 log 10 𝑓 𝑀𝐻𝑧 −13.82 log 10 ℎ 𝑏 − 𝐶 𝐻 +(44.9−6.55
    log 10 ℎ 𝑏 ) log 10 (𝑑) (4) where 𝐿 𝑈 = Path loss in Urban areas (dB) ℎ 𝑏 = Height
    of base station antenna (m) ℎ 𝑚 = Height of mobile antenna (m) f = Frequency of
    transmission (MHz) 𝐶 𝐻 = Antenna height correction factor (dB) d = Distance between
    the base and mobile stations (km). For small and medium-sized urban cities, the
    following equation can be used [33]. 𝐶 𝐻 =(1.1 log 10 𝑓 𝑀𝐻𝑧 −0.7) ℎ 𝑚 −(1.56 log
    10 (𝑓)−0.8) (5) The study area belongs to this category. Hence, the Hata-Okumura
    model suits for this application.The selected propagation path-loss model for
    the area is simulated in the web application Radio Mobile Freeware by VE2DBE [34]
    for the Edakochi study area. The simulator provided a propagation model for the
    area considering the transmission, channel, and communication parameters, including
    losses and the land cover model for the area. Figure 5 shows the link between
    the transmitter and receiver. Figure 5. Propagation model. The simulation parameter
    and results for the source (transmitter) and destination (receiver) are shown
    in Figure 6. Moreover, the coverage prediction cellular expert has several types
    of advanced coverage prediction algorithms for modeling microwave point-to-point,
    point-to-multipoint, fixed, and mobile radio systems based on ITU-R, ETSI, COST
    231, and IEEE standards and recommendations. The models can be calibrated using
    drive test data and customized for specific terrain and land use types. The propagation
    models cover a distance range from several meters up to 150 km and frequencies
    from 20 kHz up to 100 GHz. Cellular expert supports Line of Sight, Hata, COST
    231 [35], Walfish-Ikegami [36], SUI type models [37], and the ability to implement
    additional prediction models. Cellular expert has the unique ability to use combined
    prediction models according to environmental conditions. Figure 6. Propagation
    model results. 4.3. Delay-Efficient Offloading in IoT-Enabled WDN The IoT-enabled
    WDN has to be designed considering the propagation model within the study area.
    Delay-efficient offloading within the network involves transferring the data processing
    and computational tasks from the sensors to remote clouds to reduce processing
    delays. These techniques could increase the efficiency of the network. Several
    aspects must be considered while designing the network, such as task identification,
    offloading decision, task offloading, computational offloading, and energy considerations
    to achieve efficient service quality. A successful transmission happens when the
    received SIR (Signal-to-interference ratio) at the receiver node is larger than
    some specific SIR threshold 𝜃 . Otherwise, retransmission will be conducted. Let
    𝜂 be the spectral efficiency of the wireless link of the edge device 𝑒 𝑖 and the
    fog device 𝑓 𝑖 ′ . Transmission power required from the edge node 𝑒 𝑖 to fog node
    𝑓 𝑖 ′ through the link j is 𝑃 𝑖↦ 𝑖 ′ 𝑡 and the received power at the fog node
    𝑖 ′ is 𝑃 𝑗 𝑟 . The spectral efficiency of the system 𝜂 [38] is 𝜂= log 2 ⎛ ⎝ ⎜
    ⎜ 1+ 𝑃 𝑖↦ 𝑖 ′ 𝑡 𝛿 𝑃 𝑖 +𝐵× 𝑃 𝑛 0 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ (6) where 𝑃 𝑖 is the interference power
    spectral density, 𝑃 𝑛 0 is the noise power spectral density, and 𝛿 is the product
    of losses such as the Channel loss rate and the shadowing effect of the wireless
    channel. 𝐷 𝜏 = 𝐷 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 + 𝐷 𝑡 + 𝐷 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑐 + 𝐷 𝑞 (7) where 𝐷 𝜏 is the total delay, 𝐷
    𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 is the propagation delay, 𝐷 𝑡 is the transmission delay, 𝐷 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑐 is the processing
    delay, and 𝐷 𝑞 is the queuing delay. 𝐷 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 Equation (4) path-loss of the channel
    leads to the propagation delay. The path loss between antennas increases as the
    path length increases [39]. 𝐷 𝑡 the time taken to push the data bits/packets to
    the receiver. It depends on the transmission channel 𝐶 𝑖↦𝑖′ 𝑗 to the 𝑒 𝑖 to the
    𝑓 𝑖 ′ , channel bandwidth B, 𝑏 𝑖 size of the data. The delay depends on the transmission

    𝐵 𝑏 𝑖 𝑇 𝑅 𝑀+ 𝑓 𝑖 ′ 𝑝𝑐 (8) where 𝛼 is the constant delay parameter for the propagation
    delay. From Equation (8), it is evident that the delay of the WDN communication
    network depends on the propagation model, path loss, and various network and communication
    parameters as described. A noisy propagation or path loss model can reduce the
    spectral efficiency of the system, which in turn causes a delayed communication
    network. The IoT-enabled WDN has to be designed considering the design constraints
    and propagation models within the study area. For that, the delay has to be reduced
    within the network for efficient communication. The delay minimization techniques
    are discussed in the following subsection. 4.3.1. Delay Modelling Consider a multilevel
    network as shown in Figure 1. After computation, the data from the different edge
    nodes have to be transmitted to the cloud server. So, the data from the various
    edge devices like FMS, LMS, QMS, and PMS has to be transmitted to the server after
    the necessary computations. All the transmissions are continuous or event-triggered
    at discrete intervals to optimize the system’s delay. Each sensor subsystem introduces
    a delay in sensing, processing, and transmission. The sensor systems have to sense
    parameters like pressure, water level, flow, etc., by using different types of
    sensors, and all of these contribute to the sensing delay. The sensed data has
    to be converted to equivalent electrical parameters after the computations, contributing
    to the processing delay. Transmission delay involves the delay while transmitting
    the data. The delay in the network is given by 𝑑 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝 = 𝑑 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠 + 𝑑 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑐 + 𝑑 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠
    (9) where, 𝑑 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝 is the total delay in the communication network, 𝑑 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠 is the
    sensing delay, 𝑑 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑐 is the processing delay and 𝑑 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠 is the transmission
    delay of a single node. Even after the data is transmitted, there is a delay contributed
    by the channel due to the channel bandwidth and propagation effects. Thus, the
    delay in the channel will vary as a function, 𝛼 of bandwidth and propagation effects.
    𝑑 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑛 =𝛼( 𝑑 𝑏𝑎𝑛𝑑 , 𝑑 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 ) (10) where, 𝑑 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑛 is the channel delay, 𝑑 𝑏𝑎𝑛𝑑 is
    the delay due to bandwidth issues, and 𝑑 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 is the delay due to propagation
    effects. One of the reasons for the delay in the network is the presence of the
    number of edge devices in the network. After processing the data, the edge devices
    directly send the data to the cloud server. Let the total number of edge devices
    be 𝑁 𝑒 . The data transmitted from the edge has to reach the cloud server. As
    the edge device transmits data after individual processing, these come 𝑁 𝑒 times
    data processing and transmission. Then, the total capacity of the cloud server
    can be given by the below equation: 𝐶 𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑢𝑑 = 𝑁 𝑒 ( 𝑑 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝 + 𝑑 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑛 ) (11) 𝐶 𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑢𝑑
    = 𝑁 𝑒 ( 𝑑 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠 + 𝑑 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑐 + 𝑑 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠 +𝛼( 𝑑 𝑏𝑎𝑛𝑑 , 𝑑 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 )) (12) Consider the transmission
    parameters of each edge node and channel parameters as in Table 3. Table 3. Parameters
    for data transmission. The cloud server is also limited to a certain number of
    connections to ensure better communication between the lower-level devices. The
    properties of the cloud server are also described in Table 3. As the number of
    devices connected to the cloud servers increases, congestion in the channel and
    buffer leads to data loss and network issues. When all the edge nodes are directly
    sending the data after processing, as per Equation (12), there occurs the chance
    of either link breakage or cloud server overload due to the reception of an enormous
    amount of data. On introducing an intermediate node between the edge and cloud,
    say fog node, there comes a level between the edge devices and cloud server for
    data processing and transmission. The fog node could prevent link breakage and
    reduce the delay in the network. So, introducing a fog node by including intermediate
    computations can resolve these issues. The number of fog nodes required depends
    on the requirements of edge nodes and cloud servers to achieve a congestion-free,
    non-lossy network. In the considered scenario, the necessary parameters for the
    fog node are shown in Table 3. Let the total number of fog devices be 𝑁 𝑓 . Then,
    the total capacity of the cloud server can be expressed in terms of fog node parameters
    using the Equations (13) and (14). So, the intermediate fog node could reduce
    the computation time and ease the processing and transmission delay, hence optimizing
    the complete communication network. 𝐶 𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑢𝑑 = 𝑁 𝑓 ( 𝑑 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝 + 𝑑 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑛 ) (13) 𝐶 𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑢𝑑
    = 𝑁 𝑓 ( 𝑑 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑐 + 𝑑 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠 +𝛼( 𝑑 𝑏𝑎𝑛𝑑 , 𝑑 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 )) (14) In order to optimize the
    network, a fixed number of edge nodes are connected to a single fog node, which,
    after the computations, will transmit to the cloud server. Let the number of edge
    nodes connected to a single fog node be 𝑁 𝑒 𝑓 . Then, the capacity of the single
    fog node is given by Equations (15) and (16). 𝐶 𝑓𝑜𝑔 = 𝑁 𝑒 𝑓( 𝑑 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝 + 𝑑 𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑛 )
    (15) 𝐶 𝑓𝑜𝑔 = 𝑁 𝑒 𝑓( 𝑑 𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠 + 𝑑 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑐 + 𝑑 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠 +𝛼( 𝑑 𝑏𝑎𝑛𝑑 , 𝑑 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 )) (16) Considering
    the channel is ideal when edge nodes are sending data directly to the cloud server,
    having capacity 𝐶 𝑐 is dependent on the number of edge nodes 𝑁 𝑒 and the data
    rate of each edge node 𝐷 𝑒 . Then the link will break if, 𝑁 𝑒 𝐷 𝑒 > 𝐶 𝑐 (17) This
    is the limiting case when the edge nodes send data directly to the cloud server.
    The link breakage can be prevented by introducing additional intermediate nodes
    between the edge and cloud devices, the fog node. So, the number of fog nodes
    required depends on the number of lower-level edge nodes and the data rate of
    the edge devices for a fixed cloud server. The limiting case when multiple fog
    nodes are present can be expressed as 𝑁 𝑓 1 𝐷 𝑓 1 + 𝑁 𝑓 2 𝐷 𝑓 2 + 𝑁 𝑓 3 𝐷 𝑓 3
    +......+ 𝑁 𝑓 𝑛 𝐷 𝑓 𝑛 > 𝐶 𝑐 (18) where, 𝑁 𝑓 1 , 𝑁 𝑓 2 , ... 𝑁 𝑓 𝑛 are the intermediate
    fog nodes, 𝐷 𝑓 1 , 𝐷 𝑓 2 ,... 𝐷 𝑓 𝑛 are the data rates of the intermediate nodes
    and 𝐶 𝑐 is the capacity of cloud server. Considering the delay within the network,
    the proposed IoT-based wireless communication network and data packet flow are
    discussed in the following subsection. 4.3.2. Packet Flow and Delay-Efficient
    Offloaded WDN Architecture The IoT-enabled communication topology can be explained
    with the topology diagrams shown in Figure 7. The topology consists of three units—edge
    node, fog node, and cloud server. The edge node consists of a sensor unit and
    a communication unit. It is to be deployed at the data collection points near
    pipelines. There are multiple edge nodes. The data sent by the edge nodes after
    edge computation is sent to the fog nodes. The fog nodes, after fog computation,
    are sent to the cloud server. The cloud server is the monitoring station or the
    user interface, which is located far away from the communication unit. Figure
    7. IoT-enabled Communication Network Topology. The architecture is integrated
    with all the edge systems, fog nodes, and the cloud server in the Edakochi area.
    The major communication packets involved in the IoT-based communication network
    are the data packets, control packets, and error packets. The data flow diagram
    between the edge nodes and the cloud server is shown in Figure 8. The data packet
    serves the data from the different edge units, which contribute the data from
    PMS, FMS, LMS, and QMS. These sensors provide the digital signals corresponding
    to the analog measured values, which are then transmitted to the fog nodes. The
    control packet is for monitoring the efficiency of the packet transmission. The
    emergency alert messages are sent as packets from the edge devices to the fog
    or cloud server as control packets. The error packets are sent from the cloud/fog
    devices to the edge nodes, informing the functional disabilities. These packets
    are event-triggered. Similarly, the packet flow diagram between the edge and the
    cloud server by introducing an intermediate fog node is shown in Figure 9. Figure
    8. IoT Communication Network Packet Flow Diagram between edge nodes and cloud
    server. Figure 9. IoT Communication Network Packet Flow Diagram between edge node
    and cloud server using fog node. The Packet Flow Diagram of the IoT-enabled communication
    network topology with multiple fog nodes is shown in Figure 10. The main packets
    involved in the 3-layer hierarchy network consisting of edge network, fog network,
    and cloud network are the data packet, control packet, and error packet. The tabulation
    of the details of the different packets as per Figure 10 is shown in Table 4.
    Figure 10. IoT Communication Network Packet Flow Diagram. Table 4. Details of
    the different packets. 4.4. Energy Offloading for IoT-Enabled WDN The path loss
    will increase the delay, and the delay in the network will, in turn, increase
    the node operating time and increase the number of re-transmissions. The problems
    created in the channels in the network will increase the packet loss, which leads
    to multiple re-transmissions. In sub-urban areas, due to channel dynamics and
    an increase in the number of obstructions, the transmitting power has to be increased
    in order to reduce delay, which in turn increases the energy of the network. But
    the objective is to Offload the energy of the network. These multiple re-transmissions
    will, in turn, increase the delay and energy. From Equations (7) and (8), the
    delay in the network could be calculated. As energy is a function of delay and
    time, from the equations of delay and by calculating the time, the energy required
    for the network could be calculated. The energy of the communication network can
    be defined as the power utilization as a factor of time. When all the edge, fog,
    and cloud devices are powered, data transmission happens at equal time intervals,
    depending on the power availability. Such operation of the nodes will lead to
    a fast drain of the battery, so the energy usage has to be optimized. The energy
    usage can only be optimized by reducing the operating time without compromising
    the required transmissions. Energy optimization can be achieved by optimizing
    the energy consumption in the operation of the edge and fog devices by intelligently
    keeping the various devices in different operational states. The edge and the
    fog node are set to different states between the 𝑂𝑁 and 𝑂𝐹𝐹 states like 𝑆𝐿𝐸𝐸𝑃/𝐼𝐷𝐿𝐸
    , 𝐴𝐶𝑇𝐼𝑉𝐸 , 𝑀𝑂𝑁𝐼𝑇𝑂𝑅 , 𝐶𝑂𝑀𝑃𝑈𝑇𝐸 , 𝑇𝑅𝐴𝑁𝑆𝑀𝐼𝑇 , etc., to reduce the energy consumption
    of the nodes. The state transition diagram of the complete nodes inter-connecting
    the edge, fog, and cloud is shown in Figure 11. The operation of each state is
    defined below: Figure 11. State Transition Diagram. 𝑂𝑁 : Operation state in which
    the IoT node is powered. It is the state with minimum power consumption. 𝑂𝐹𝐹 :
    Operation state in which the IoT node is not powered. 𝑆𝐿𝐸𝐸𝑃/𝐼𝐷𝐿𝐸 : Operation state
    in which the IoT node is in a temporary 𝑂𝐹𝐹 state, even if the node is powered
    𝑂𝑁 . The power consumption is the least in this state. 𝑆𝐸𝑁𝑆𝐸 : Operation state
    in which the IoT sensors are working - collecting the data from different sensors.
    𝐶𝑂𝑀𝑃𝑈𝑇𝐸 : Operation state in which the IoT computations and processing are taking
    place after the sensor data collection. 𝑀𝐸𝑀𝑂𝑅𝑌 : Operation state in which the
    IoT sensor collected data are processed and stored in the memory unit. 𝑇𝑅𝐴𝑁𝑆𝑀𝐼𝑇
    : Operation state in which transmission is taking place. The radio is ON, and
    the antennas are active. 𝑅𝐸𝐶𝐸𝐼𝑉𝐸 : Operation state in which reception is taking
    place. The radio is ON, and the antennas are active. The Offloading of the energy
    consumption of the different devices and thereby improving the device lifetime
    by considering different use case scenarios for energy offloading is discussed
    in the below sections. 4.4.1. Operational Strategy 1 Consider the case when all
    the edge and fog devices are in 𝑂𝑁 state; the transmission and reception are taking
    place every second. Then, let the power consumption at the state be 𝑃 𝑂𝑁 and the
    energy consumption be 𝐸 𝑂𝑁 . 𝐸 𝑂𝑁 = 𝑃 𝑂𝑁 × 𝑡 𝑆𝐸𝑁𝑆𝐸 (19) 𝐸 𝑆𝐸𝑁𝑆𝐸 = 𝑃 𝑆𝐸𝑁𝑆𝐸 × 𝑡
    𝑆𝐸𝑁𝑆𝐸 (20) 𝐸 𝐶𝑂𝑀𝑃𝑈𝑇𝐸 = 𝑃 𝐶𝑂𝑀𝑃𝑈𝑇𝐸 × 𝑡 𝐶𝑂𝑀𝑃𝑈𝑇𝐸 (21) 𝐸 𝑇𝑅𝐴𝑁𝑆𝑀𝐼𝑇/𝑅𝐸𝐶𝐸𝐼𝑉𝐸 = 𝑃 𝑇𝑅𝐴𝑁𝑆𝑀𝐼𝑇/𝑅𝐸𝐶𝐸𝐼𝑉𝐸
    × 𝑡 𝑇𝑅𝐴𝑁𝑆𝑀𝐼𝑇/𝑅𝐸𝐶𝐸𝐼𝑉𝐸 (22) Then, the total energy consumption of the edge and fog
    nodes when both are active with the transmitting and receiving antennas always
    powered can be expressed as: 𝐸 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝐸𝑑𝑔𝑒 = 𝐸 𝑂𝑁 + 𝐸 𝑆𝐸𝑁𝑆𝐸 + 𝐸 𝐶𝑂𝑀𝑃𝑈𝑇𝐸 + 𝐸 𝑇𝑅𝐴𝑁𝑆𝑀𝐼𝑇/𝑅𝐸𝐶𝐸𝐼𝑉𝐸
    (23) 𝐸 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝐹𝑜𝑔 = 𝐸 𝑂𝑁 + 𝐸 𝐶𝑂𝑀𝑃𝑈𝑇𝐸 + 𝐸 𝑇𝑅𝐴𝑁𝑆𝑀𝐼𝑇/𝑅𝐸𝐶𝐸𝐼𝑉𝐸 (24) 4.4.2. Operational
    Strategy 2 In this case, two more states are introduced: 𝑆𝐿𝐸𝐸𝑃/𝐼𝐷𝐿𝐸 and 𝑀𝐸𝑀𝑂𝑅𝑌
    state. Here, the data collected by the sensors are processed and stored in the
    memory unit. 𝐸 𝑆𝐿𝐸𝐸𝑃 = 𝑃 𝑆𝐿𝐸𝐸𝑃 × 𝑡 𝑆𝐿𝐸𝐸𝑃 (25) 𝐸 𝑀𝐸𝑀𝑂𝑅𝑌 = 𝑃 𝑀𝐸𝑀𝑂𝑅𝑌 × 𝑡 𝑀𝐸𝑀𝑂𝑅𝑌 (26)
    𝐸 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝐸𝑑𝑔𝑒 = 𝐸 𝑂𝑁 + 𝐸 𝑆𝐿𝐸𝐸𝑃 + 𝐸 𝑆𝐸𝑁𝑆𝐸 + 𝐸 𝐶𝑂𝑀𝑃𝑈𝑇𝐸 + 𝐸 𝑀𝐸𝑀𝑂𝑅𝑌 + 𝐸 𝑇𝑅𝐴𝑁𝑆𝑀𝐼𝑇/𝑅𝐸𝐶𝐸𝐼𝑉𝐸
    (27) 𝐸 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙𝐹𝑜𝑔 = 𝐸 𝑂𝑁 + 𝐸 𝑆𝐿𝐸𝐸𝑃 + 𝐸 𝐶𝑂𝑀𝑃𝑈𝑇𝐸 + 𝐸 𝑀𝐸𝑀𝑂𝑅𝑌 + 𝐸 𝑇𝑅𝐴𝑁𝑆𝑀𝐼𝑇/𝑅𝐸𝐶𝐸𝐼𝑉𝐸 (28)
    5. Algorithms Performed in the Communication Architecture This section explains
    the algorithms for the random node introduced into the communication network.
    Here considering two instances: To categorize the random node to edge, fog or
    miscellaneous category To allocate an edge node to a fog node for hierarchical
    communication 5.1. Node Categorizing Algorithm The categorization of a random
    node to an edge node, fog node, or miscellaneous node can depend on several factors,
    such as the workload and requirements, the computing resources and capabilities
    available, and the network connectivity and latency of the random node. The Node
    categorizing algorithm based on offloading is presented in Algorithm 1. Each of
    the candidate nodes has a unique identifier, and it has the capability to share
    self-capabilities and workload. At the initialization process, the node performs
    the self-discovery and computes its own properties such as processing power 𝑁
    𝑐𝑝𝑢 , memory 𝑁 𝑚𝑒𝑚 , and storage capacity 𝑁 𝑠𝑐 . The node also calculates its
    offloading requirement by task assessment and proximity calculation. Furthermore,
    it compares the resources, node capabilities, and offloading requirements with
    the baseline properties and identifies the category. 5.2. Node Allocation Algorithm
    The allocation of an edge node to a fog node would depend on several factors,
    such as the workload and requirements of the edge node, the computing resources
    and capabilities of the available fog nodes, and the network connectivity and
    latency between the edge node and the candidate fog nodes. The Node categorizing
    algorithm based on offloading is presented in Algorithm 2. Algorithm 1 Node categorizing

    The numeric analysis for the communication network with delay and energy Offloading
    is discussed in the below subsections. 6.1. Delay-Efficient Offloading The numerical
    validation of the delay Offloading model is as follows: Let the capacity of the
    cloud server be 1 Gbps. Consider that ten edge nodes are connected to the cloud
    server, each having a data rate of 100 Mbps/s. So, as per Equation (18), 𝑁 𝑒 𝐷
    𝑒 =10×100MBps/s=1000MBps=1GBps (29) So, the cloud server cannot accommodate further
    edge nodes as it has reached the capacity of the server. In this case, we introduce
    fog nodes for further computations, which reduces the transmitting data content,
    saving the cloud capacity. Similarly, the capacity of the cloud server using intermediate
    fog nodes for computations as per Equation (29) can be validated as follows. Consider
    there are 15 edge nodes and three fog nodes. Five edge nodes will send the data
    to each corresponding fog node, and after fog, computations are sent to the cloud
    server as shown in Figure 12. Figure 12. Diagram depicting Delay-efficient Offloading.
    Let the data rate of the cloud server be 1.5 GBps, and there are three edge nodes
    having data rate 500 MBps. 𝑁 𝑓 1 𝐷 𝑓 1 =3×500MBps/s=1500MBps=1.5GBps (30) So if
    the limiting data rate or number of devices connected is crossed above the limit,
    link breakage will occur. Hence, there arises the need to increase the capacity
    or optimize the fog or edge devices in order to prevent link breakage. Consider
    the example scenario shown in Figure 12. Assume that the delay gets doubled with
    an increase in the number of nodes in the network. Let the delay be 260 μ s, 100
    μ s, and 30 μ s when the edge nodes are directly connected to the cloud server,
    edge nodes are connected to the cloud server through a single fog node, and edge
    nodes are connected to the cloud server through two fog nodes respectively. The
    delay within the network is shown in Figure 13. Figure 13. Delay Offloading within
    the Network demonstrated using an example scenario. 6.2. Energy-Efficient Offloading
    Assume the total energy available is 10,000 mWh. Using the data of power consumption
    and operating time for a day in different operational modes from Table 5, the
    energy and lifetime of the different sensor units are calculated. Table 5. Power
    consumption and operating time for a day in different operational modes. 6.2.1.
    Strategy 1 A per Equation (24), 𝐸 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 of Edge Node for 𝑆𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑜 1 = 0.5 × 24
    + 4 × 18 + 2 × 18 + 12 × 18 = 336 mWh. No. of days the edge node will work in
    battery power s per Scenario 1 = 10,000 /336 = 29.7 days. 𝐸 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 of Fog Node
    for 𝑆𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑜 1 = 0.5 × 24 + 2 × 12 + 12 × 12 = 180 mWh. No. of days the fog node
    will work in battery power as per Scenario 1 = 10,000 /180 = 55.5 days. 6.2.2.
    Strategy 2 A per Equation (28), 𝐸 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 of Edge Node for 𝑆𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑜 2 = 0.5 × 24
    + 4 × 12 + 2 × 10 + 12 × 4 + 0.5 × 12 + 1 × 8 + 12 × 4 = 190 mWh. No. of days
    the edge node will work in battery power as per Scenario 2 = 10,000/190 = 52.6
    days. 𝐸 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 of Fog Node for 𝑆𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑜 2 = 0.5 × 24 + 2 × 10 + 12 × 4 + 0.5 ×
    12 + 1 × 8 + 12 × 3 = 130 mWh. No. of days the fog node will work in battery power
    as per Scenario 2 = 10,000 /130 = 76.9 days. The energy will gradually decrease
    linearly with an increase in the number of days for edge and fog nodes. The decrease
    for both edge and fog nodes is shown in Figure 14 and Figure 15. From this, it
    can be easily understood that the introduction of more operational states could
    reduce power consumption and save more energy and lifetime. Figure 14. Depleting
    energy of single edge node. Figure 15. Depleting energy of single fog node. Consider
    the network where there are 15 edge devices connected to the cloud server via
    three fog nodes. The total energy of the network is given by the Equation (31)
    𝐸 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = 𝐸 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 ×𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑒 𝑑𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑠+ 𝐸 𝑓𝑜𝑔 ×𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑓𝑜𝑔 𝑑𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑐𝑒𝑠 (31) Calculating
    the total energy of the network as per scenario 1 will be 5580 mWh, and scenario
    2 will be 3240 mWh. Assuming that the network contains 18 nodes, each having a
    battery capacity of 10,000 mWh. The depleting energy of the network for both scenarios
    is shown in Figure 16. From the graph, we could clearly analyze the depletion
    in energy. The battery capacity, as per scenario 1 could support only 33 days,
    whereas scenario 2, having more states, could provide battery backup up to 55
    days. Thus the network implemented as per scenario 2 could provide 40% more energy
    efficiency compared to scenario 1. Figure 16. Depleting energy of network. 7.
    Results and Discussions The IoT-integrated water distribution system with optimization
    of delay and energy based on the propagation model is discussed in the work. The
    work is initiated by identifying the different research challenges within an existing
    WDN and has included different sensor systems at different levels of the WDN.
    IoT communication entities such as edge, fog and cloud nodes were introduced to
    each level to monitor the WDN. The following procedures were introduced to implement
    a real-world communication model for this site-specific IoT-integrated WDN system,
    which could be applicable to any site-specific IoT-integrated communication model.
    The study area chosen is Kochi in India. The land cover classification for the
    study area is developed using the MLC-supervised algorithm. Three major categories
    have been derived from the supervised classification: water, vegetation, and built-up
    areas. Since our study area is a secondary metropolitan city, upon analyzing the
    land cover classification and the propagation models, the propagation model that
    fits the application is the Hata-Okumura model. The derived Hata-Okumura path
    loss model for small and medium-sized urban areas as per Equation (4) is applied.
    This path loss model depends upon the height of the transmitting and receiving
    antennas, gain of the antennas, frequency of transmission, antenna correction
    factor and the distance between the transmitting and receiving devices. The same
    scenario is modeled using the simulation software ‘Radio Mobile Freeware by VE2DBE’.
    The simulation results show successful communication with 70% of reliability and
    161.50 dB system gain enabling enough network coverage and connectivity required
    for the specific application. The delay-efficient for the IoT-enabled WDN is derived
    considering the wireless propagation model based on the study area. The delay
    in the communication network depends on the propagation model, path loss and other
    network parameters. We derived the equation for the optimized number of edge,
    fog, and cloud nodes using operating frequencies, transmitting power, antenna
    gain, antenna height, number of available channels, data rate, signal strength
    and bandwidth. Furthermore, the IoT-enabled communication topology as in Figure
    7, proposes concerning the delay-efficient offloading for the study area. The
    communication network serves the WDN for various challenges. Three types of communication
    packets are designed to address these challenges: data packets, control packets,
    and error packets. The communication packet flow between different IoT entities
    in the area are also defined in Figure 8, Figure 9 and Figure 10. Various communication
    packets such as data packets, control packets and error packets are defined based
    on the characteristics and communication entities of the network. In order to
    achieve efficient transmission, optimization of the delay and energy within the
    propagation model has to be achieved. Energy-efficient offloading has been brought
    in by considering the different operation states and comparing different scenarios
    to find the best-suited scenario for the specific study area. Energy optimization
    involves the transmission of signals starting from lower power and increasing
    the power untill it is received at the cloud server. However, upon increasing
    the number of retransmissions, the delay in receiving the data increases. So,
    optimization has to be bought in between the ‘delay and path loss’ and ‘delay
    and energy’ for the efficient working of the complete IoT-based system. Considering
    all the parameters of the specific study area, path loss models, delay-efficient
    and energy-efficient offloading, algorithms for node categorisation, and edge-to-fog
    node allocation have been developed. The developed algorithms are analyzed and
    numerically validated. The comparison results from the numeric models show that
    the best operating scenario can be implemented. Based on these approximations,
    the optimum placement of the fog nodes linked with the edge nodes and cloud server
    could be achieved. The delay and energy-optimized high-level IoT-enabled communication
    network architecture is shown in Figure 17. The same process discussed in this
    work can be utilized in building the IoT-enabled communication network for any
    site. Figure 17. IoT-enabled Communication Network Architecture. 8. Conclusions
    The paper discusses the requirement for an IoT-based water distribution system
    and presents the delay and energy-efficient offloading strategies for the network
    in Smart Cities. Considering the design constraints in designing the IoT-enabled
    WDN, the IoT-enabled WDN is designed. As a case study of IoT-enabled WDN, the
    network in Kochi, Kerala, India is considered. Within the selected study area,
    the land use, land cover, and wireless propagation model within the area are analyzed.
    Based on the analysis results, the delay and energy within the WDN are efficiently
    offloaded, considering multiple operational scenarios. The different algorithms
    involved in the communication architecture, like the node categorizing algorithm
    and node allocation algorithm, are explained in detail. The numerical analysis
    of delay-efficient and energy-efficient offloading considering different operational
    scenarios are also presented in detail. Finally, considering all the parameters,
    the IoT-enabled communication network architecture for the WDN is designed. Author

  description: The complexity of Fuel Cell (FC) systems demands a profound and sustained
    understanding of the various phenomena occurring inside of it. Thus far, FCs,
    especially Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs), have been recognized
    as being among the most promising technologies for reducing Green House Gas (GHG)
    emissions because they can convert the chemical energy bonded to hydrogen and
    oxygen into electricity and heat. However, their efficiency remains limited. To
    enhance their efficiency, two distinct factors are suggested. First, the quality
    of materials plays a significant role in the development of more robust and efficient
    FCs. Second, the ability to identify, mitigate, and reduce the occurrence of faults
    through the use of robust control algorithms is crucial. Therefore, more focused
    on the second point, this paper compiles, distinguishes, and analyzes several
    publications from the past 25 years related to faults and their diagnostic techniques
    in FCs. Furthermore, the paper presents various schemes outlining different symptoms,
    their causes, and corresponding fault algorithms.

    and concerns with scientists and researchers around the world. It is caused by
    the increase in Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, such as carbon dioxide, which
    are released during the process of burning fossil fuel to produce electric energy.
    Nonetheless, most European countries are starting to have a significant quota
    of Renewable Energies [1]. Even though the percentage of renewable energy is increasing,
    another problem related to energy storage arises. This problem is related to the
    intermittent nature of renewable sources, which are dependent on external, uncontrollable
    factors, such as the sun and the wind, generating a gap between the available
    energy and its final use. Therefore, storing the excess produced energy is paramount
    to eliminating the intermittent nature of renewable energies [2]. Among other
    solutions, hydrogen storage is being intensively researched to work as an energy
    vector, as illustrated in Figure 1, for future direct conversion to electricity
    when demanded [1,3]. Figure 1. General classification of electrical energy storage
    technologies. Converting the energy stored in hydrogen back to electricity requires
    an electrochemical device, such as an FC, which chemically converts the energy
    present into two reactants, in this case, hydrogen and oxygen, into electricity
    and heat [4]. Despite the simple theoretical process, the overall composition
    of the system is still dependent on expensive and rare materials, such as gold
    and platinum [4]. So, to ensure that the lifetime expectancy increases and the
    FC system is reliable, a deep understanding of how it operates under different
    conditions is required; this includes identifying ways to prevent and address
    any potential issues, like faults [5]. Thereafter, the analysis of fault diagnosis
    plays a crucial role in ensuring the stable operation and efficient output of
    FC systems. In recent years, numerous scholars have delved into this area to enhance
    accuracy and reliability. There are primarily two types of approaches: model-based
    methods (both qualitative and quantitative) and data-driven methods. In the model-based
    approach, an accurate mathematical model is developed based on the internal mechanisms
    of FC system operation [6]. Subsequently, residual vectors are utilized as features
    for statistical analysis to extract fault information embedded in the residual
    sequence. This process enables the detection of abnormal situations within the
    system, but existing fault diagnosis technology falls short in predicting the
    future degradation trend of FC systems. If the degradation of FCs could be estimated
    before a complete failure, maintenance personnel would have ample time to devise
    maintenance plans and replace components proactively. This proactive approach
    could significantly reduce repair and maintenance costs and prevent the unscheduled
    downtime of FC systems [7,8]. Faults, or failure modes, have been well established
    in the literature [9], and some reviews on fault diagnosis have been summarised
    in [10,11]. For example, in both [12,13], several tests for single and multi-cells
    under the influence of constant and dynamic loads have been reviewed and analyzed.
    It has been concluded that ensuring a specific relationship between failure modes
    and a particular signal, referenced as an indicator, requires an extensive amount
    of data under various operation conditions. However, there is an evident relationship
    between the cathode pressure drop and cathode flooding. Moreover, ref. [14] presented
    different model and non-model diagnosis methods for FC, while ref. [15] focused
    more on non-model-based diagnostics approaches. The conclusion drawn was that,
    when compared to model-based techniques, non-model-based approaches require a
    larger dataset of both normal and faulty conditions. Nevertheless, they are considered
    a prominent method for FC fault diagnosis due to their simplicity, flexibility,
    and ability to handle system uncertainties. Regardless, most of the published
    work has only focused on closed-cathode single-cell systems and on specific diagnostic
    techniques; therefore, it is necessary to compel, update, and analyze the different
    fault diagnosis techniques and fault-tolerant modes presented in the literature.
    This paper aims to present the main different types of FC technology and analyze
    the different fault diagnostic approaches applied to FC systems over the past
    years, providing special concern in PEMFCs with the open cathode. To achieve that,
    more than one hundred papers were reviewed and compared. The paper is organized
    as follows: firstly, a brief introduction on the topic is provided; secondly,
    the working principle and types of fuel cells are presented; thirdly, a brief
    section on how to model both FC systems and faults is introduced; fourthly, the
    definition of faults and the different faults that may occur, as well as their
    organization in terms of reversibility, are provided; fifthly, the different faults
    are discussed; sixthly, an extensive discussion is presented; and finally, the
    main conclusions are drawn. 2. Fuel Cells Technologies Fuel cells can be classified
    based on several factors. First, they can be categorized depending on the type
    of electrolyte separating the electrodes they use, which can be either alkaline
    or acidic. Second, a more common classification is through the operating temperature;
    therefore, they are referred to as a High-Temperature Fuel Cell (HT-FC) or a Low-Temperature
    Fuel Cell (LT-FC). Table 1 outlines the typical characteristics of the different
    types of FCs, organized by their operating temperatures. The efficiency of FCs
    is influenced by the choice of electrolytes, catalysts, and operating temperature.
    Different FCs and their applications are illustrated in Table 1. Table 1. An overview
    of the different materials for different types of FCs. MCFCs find applications
    in energy storage [22,23,24,25,26,27]. Operating efficiently at 560 °C, MCFCs
    generate excess heat, which can be utilized in cogeneration processes. AFCs were
    the first FC model to be used by NASA in the first space exploration missions
    because of their vast temperature range and high efficiency, which were critical
    aspects at the time. PAFCs represent one of the first widely commercialized fuel
    cell technologies in the mid-1970s and offered a reliable solution for stationary
    applications at the time [18,22,28,29]. Due to their moderate operating temperature,
    PAFCs boast high efficiency and offer a wide range of reactant possibilities.
    However, they suffer from drawbacks such as poor power density, limited lifespan,
    and high production costs, which hinder their progress. DMFCs undergo methanol
    oxidation to convert chemical energy into electrical energy [30]. Regarded as
    one of the most advanced fuel cells in terms of performance and user convenience,
    the DMFC is being explored as a potential alternative to traditional batteries
    in portable systems. These fuel cells fall into the category of low-temperature
    fuel cells based on polymer membranes; however, they have a high environmental
    impact since carbon dioxide is one of the byproducts. Moreover, another drawback
    of DMFC is the possibility of methanol crossover through the membrane, causing
    the efficiency to decrease [31]. SOFCs are the most suitable for high-power applications
    and large-scale centralized electric energy production. Unlike other FCs, they
    do not require expensive and rare materials for the electrodes and are less prone
    to Carbon Monoxide (CO) poisoning; however, a higher start-up time to reach the
    temperature range is required [4]. The PEMFC was initially developed for the Gemini
    spacecraft. In this design, a proton-conducting polymer membrane serves as the
    electrolyte, with electrodes constructed on thin layers on either surface. In
    certain aspects, the electrolyte resembles the plasticized electrolyte found in
    lithium-ion cells, comprising a liquid electrolyte trapped within a polymer matrix
    component [32]. Due to their diverse applications and the emission of residual
    GHG, PEMFCs have become a focal point for researchers seeking enhancements. Despite
    sharing a similar working principle with different types, PEMFCs consist of distinct
    components, as depicted in Figure 2. The negatively charged electrode, known as
    the anode, and its counterpart, the cathode, are separated by layers including
    a Gas Diffusion Layer (GDL). The GDL efficiently disperses reactants from the
    inlet to the catalyst layer, where crucial chemical reactions take place. On the
    anode side, hydrogen undergoes oxidation, and the resulting hydrogen protons move
    across the protonic membrane to the cathode, while electrons flow through the
    external circuit. At the cathode, oxygen is reduced by reacting with protons and
    electrons, resulting in the production of water and heat [4]. Figure 2. Fuel Cell
    composition. Another crucial characteristic of fuel cells is the polarization
    curve, depicting the relationship between fuel cell voltage and current under
    various loads. Figure 3 provides a general representation where three distinct
    zones are identified. The first zone, occurring at low power densities, is commonly
    referred to as activation polarization. This zone illustrates the energy barrier
    that must be overcome to initiate the electrochemical reaction at the electrode.
    Next, the ohmic zone exhibits a linear relationship between voltage and current.
    The slope in this zone is determined by the inherent resistance that conductors
    pose to the passage of electrical charges. Finally, the concentration zone or
    mass transport zone is characterized by a sudden voltage drop. This drop is attributed
    to the fuel cell’s inability to expel reaction products, indicating that the concentration
    of reaction products surpasses that of the reactants [4]. The zones mentioned
    in the text signify the losses that cannot be reversed. The relationship between
    voltage and current is determined chemically by comparing the open-circuit voltage
    (a reversible loss), also known as the Nernst voltage, with the irreversible losses
    mentioned earlier. Figure 3. Typical Fuel Cell polarization curve. A further consideration
    for PEMFCs is the reactant feeding configuration. In educational stack models,
    a common setup is the cathode-close configuration, where both pure hydrogen and
    oxygen supplies are required. Much of the presented research focuses on this model
    due to its cost-effectiveness, ability to function as an electrolyzer producing
    necessary gases, and its suitability for experimenting with various Membrane Electrode
    Assembly (MEA) materials. For higher stack power, PEMFCs adopt an open cathode
    configuration, using atmospheric air as the oxygen source. This configuration
    simplifies the system by eliminating the need for an external oxygen storage and
    injection system, thus reducing overall costs and minimizing parasitic losses.
    However, relying on ambient air introduces dependencies on temperature and humidity
    levels, constituting a significant drawback [33]. Managing humidity control within
    the stack poses a challenge. The correct humidity level inside the cell is crucial
    for optimal proton conductivity, facilitating ion transport. Additionally, this
    humidity level significantly impacts the promotion of efficient reactions at the
    electrodes. Furthermore, maintaining the correct humidity levels helps to regulate
    the temperature inside the stack [4,34]. Regarding hydrogen admission, three distinct
    modes are defined [35]. The first, the dead-end mode, is characterized by working
    at low pressure and with maximum hydrogen flow for all operating points while
    expelling the non-reacted hydrogen periodically through an outlet valve. The second,
    flow-through mode, employs a back-pressure regulator valve and a flow controller
    to regulate the pressure of the inlet. The third mode is similar to the first
    but recirculates the non-reacted hydrogen. These three modes are illustrated in
    Figure 4. Figure 4. Hydrogen feeding modes. (a) Dead-end mode; (b) flow-through
    mode; (c) recirculation mode. The next section is oriented to the modelling of
    FC systems, with a specific focus on PEMFCs. This attention to PEMFCs is due to
    their alignment with various parameters and reasons to address diverse challenges,
    including high energy efficiency, low operational temperatures, rapid start-up
    capabilities, and adaptability for a wide array of applications. 3. Fuel Cell
    Modelling Emulating the behavior of the FC using computational tools allows for
    a better comprehension of the system without having to physically intervein with
    it, eliminating the risk of damaging any component. Therefore, correct modeling
    is of major importance when sensible components are being studied, such as in
    the case of faults. A plethora of model possibilities have been presented in the
    literature and based on that, classification was performed, which is visually
    represented in Figure 5. Figure 5. General scheme of different FC models. The
    first works date back to the beginning of the century and were based on a premise
    still true in today’s works. Those works [36,37] are based on the simulation of
    the difference between the reversible losses and the irreversible losses that
    compose the polarization curve. Equation (1) refers to how the polarization curve
    is defined: V FC = N cell ×[E FC − R T FC nF ln ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ a H 2 O a
    H 2 a 1 2 O 2 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ − R T FC αF ln( i FC + i n i o )− i FC × R i
    − R T FC nF ln( i l i l − i FC ) ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ (1) Parameters designation: V FC
    : Fuel Cell Voltage; i FC : Fuel Cell Current; N cell : Number of Cells in Series;
    E FC : Nerst Potential; R : Universal Gas Constant; a xx : Partial Pressure of
    the Reactants; α : Charge Transfer Coefficient; F : Farad Constant; i o : Exchange
    Current Density; i n : Internal Current Density; 𝑅 𝑖 : Fuel Cell Internal Resistance;
    n : Number of Exchange Electrons; i l : Maximum Current; T FC : Fuel Cell Temperature.
    Following the above equation, identifying and physically quantifying the value
    of the parameters is a difficult task to undertake. Based on that, authors in
    [38] analyzed how certain parameters in Equation (1) can be simulated and how
    the FC temperature affects their values. Experiments were conducted on an FC with
    an active area of 25 c m 2 and temperature variation from 50 °C to 80 °C. The
    reactants (hydrogen and air) were pre-humidified according to the temperature.
    Results showed that only 𝑖 𝑜 , 𝑅 𝑖 , and 𝑖 𝑛 can be estimated without interfering
    with other parameters. Curiously, all the estimated parameters varied linearly
    with the temperature, and 𝑅 𝑖 inclusively decreased with temperature, suggesting
    that for high values of temperatures, the ohmic losses are significantly more
    affected. Because of the different interactions between parameters of Equation
    (1), authors started to replace them with empirical mathematical equations that
    describe the same graphic trajectory of the polarization curve presented in Figure
    3. For example, in [39], a logarithm term was used to simulate the activation
    losses, without having to directly compute the terms identified in that part of
    Equation (1). Another empirical model is presented in [40]. The authors proposed
    three exponential expressions to simulate the three zones presented in Figure
    3 and validate the model both in steady and dynamic states. The expressions were
    then fitted with data obtained from a 5 kW FC, and the results showed good accuracy
    between experimental and simulated values. Another approach to Fuel Cell modeling
    is to use an electric equivalent model such as the one presented in Figure 6.
    Figure 6. Generic Fuel Cell Equivalent Circuit Model. Legend: OCV : Open-Circuit
    Voltage; C A : Equivalent Capacity Between Anode and Membrane; R A : Anode Transfer
    Resistance; R ei : Internal Equivalent Resistance; C C : Equivalent Capacity Between
    Cathode and Membrane; R C : Cathode Transfer Resistance. The model in Figure 6
    was first introduced in [41]. In Figure 6, the resistor R ei represents the equivalent
    Fuel Cell resistance and a sudden change in the current is rapidly reflected in
    the voltage drop across the load. The activation zone is characterized by the
    capacitor Ca in parallel with the resistor Ra, while the voltage source represents
    the open-circuit voltage. To estimate the parameters in Figure 6, two distinct
    approaches were performed: the first one is called the interrupt test, and its
    operating principle is based on cutting off the current drawn from the Fuel Cell
    suddenly and analyzing the voltage evaluation until it reaches the open-circuit
    voltage. This test allows one to collect data related to the activation zone.
    The second approach is a known parameter estimation technique denoted as Electrical
    Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), and it consists of performing a frequency sweep
    and plotting the graph of impedance versus frequency, also known as a Nyquist
    plot. An example of how the different elements of the equivalent circuit mode
    are related to the frequency is presented in Figure 7. Figure 7. Generic Nyquist
    plot example with the incorporation of the electric equivalent circuit. With the
    collected data, several parameter identification techniques can be adopted. For
    example, in [42], a machine learning regression model is deduced to fit the data
    and obtain the equivalent values of the equivalent resistance and capacitor values.
    Others have used curve-fitting tools [41,43,44,45]. Specifically for open-cathode
    FCs, the model is not only focused on the voltage output but also on the influence
    of reactants’ stoichiometry. Since the cathode is fed air, the oxygen percentage
    is low, and it is necessary to keep the ratio between the oxygen supplied and
    consumed (stoichiometry) higher than one. On that basis, several authors tried
    to model that behavior. In [46], a Volterra series was used to model the air-feeding
    system, so the oxygen stoichiometry could be optimized for every operation point.
    A similar idea was presented in [47], where a nonlinear model predictive control
    was employed to control the power while keeping the FC operating at the ohmic
    region with a minimum consumption of hydrogen and oxygen. To ensure that different
    experiments were conducted under different loads and different hydrogen and oxygen
    stoichiometries, a fourth-order polynomial is used to approximate the data. Therefore,
    the authors have the possibility of controlling the air intake according to the
    setpoint given by the approximation. A different polynomial approach to calculate
    the oxygen stoichiometry is presented in [48]. The authors increased the voltage
    applied to the air blower and measured the air mass flow that was moved through
    it. Finally, a third-order polynomial was then fitted to the data, and the results
    showed good agreement between the simulation and the experimental results. Since
    third-order polynomial approximation has little computational burden, it can be
    easily implemented in a low-cost processor and improve the control of air fed
    to an open-cathode FC. So far, most of the presented work has been focused on
    estimating or simulating the voltage and current of the FC as a function of the
    load and power; however, trying to model the chemical, electrochemical, and thermal
    reactions inside the cell is a major challenge. Regarding the modeling of water
    movement inside the cell, previous authors [49] tried to include the non-isothermal
    and non-isobaric effects in a single model. The model parameters included diffusion
    of the hydrogen, oxygen, and water through the porous electrodes; the electro-osmotic
    transport of liquid water in the electrodes and the membrane; and the heat generated
    in the FC. The results showed that the non-uniform temperature and pressure distributions
    have a large impact on the predicted water produced. Furthermore, in [49], a more
    robust three-dimensional model was presented, which involved all layers of the
    MEA at a constant temperature. In [50], the authors also tried to model water
    diffusion in a polymer-type membrane (known as Nafion) by assuming that the relationship
    between the membrane water content and the channel water concentration is linear.
    The authors were then able to change the parameters of relative humidity to understand
    its effects on the model. Even though the authors claim to have an error of less
    than 20% between the model and the experimental results, this error still presents
    a major effect; nonetheless, considering technology’s limitations and this being
    one of the first papers published on modeling such phenomena, dating to the beginning
    of the century, that error is more than acceptable. Another work incorporating
    the flow distribution within the gas chamber in a unit cell was introduced in
    [51]. As a mathematical basis, the laws of mass and momentum conservation are
    applied. The model was validated on a 190-cell stack in a built-in customized
    Pitot tube to measure the gas flow in an inlet and the different outlets. In theory,
    it is safe to assume that the air flow distribution is the same for all single
    cells; however, as the results show, different cells are submitted to different
    air stoichiometry, and this can be attributed to the losses that occur in the
    gas pipes. Water is a fundamental byproduct found in all key components of a fuel
    cell system, making its control vital for the efficient and reliable operation
    of FCs. Several mechanisms contribute to water transport within an FC, including
    hydraulic permeation, electro-osmotic drag, thermal-osmotic drag, and back diffusion.
    These phenomena will be thoroughly explained in section IV. Monitoring and predicting
    water movements during operation pose challenges due to the complex two-phase
    flow nature. Techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and beam interrogation
    methods like X-ray neutron imaging and high-speed photography have been employed
    for in situ observation of liquid water [52,53]. 4. State of Health (SOH) For
    many years, health monitoring has played a crucial role in engineering systems,
    ensuring performance, safety, availability, and reliability. Typically, sensors
    are employed to monitor operating conditions, performance, and loading cycles,
    allowing for the timely detection of anomalies and faults. This proactive approach
    helps prevent unforeseen incidents, downtime, and fault propagation. Minor faults
    within a system component can escalate into major issues, leading to system failure.
    The early detection or prediction of faults enables timely maintenance scheduling,
    preventing the development of more serious problems. The application of health-monitoring
    techniques provides a clear advantage, not only for safety reasons but also by
    significantly reducing unscheduled maintenance costs. Prognostics, offering information
    on the State of Health (SOH) and Remaining Useful Lifetime (RUL) of FCs, allows
    for optimized FC operation through appropriate control strategies. This, in turn,
    facilitates scheduled maintenance, effectively minimizing downtime [54,55,56].
    In the domain of FCs, SOH entails a thorough assessment of a system’s condition
    and performance capabilities over time. While there is no standardized definition
    of SOH, it serves as a metric reflecting the degradation or aging of crucial components,
    including the membrane, catalysts, electrodes, and other vital elements. Monitoring
    SOH is crucial for evaluating the long-term reliability, efficiency, and remaining
    useful life of an FC [57]. An increasing number of researchers in FC studies are
    employing the AC impedance approach, or EIS, making it a prominent research tool
    in the field. EIS serves as a reliable characterization tool, crucial for detecting
    various failure mechanisms within the FC. Its integration with the control approach
    of the necessary power converter offers the potential for real-time diagnosis
    of the FC stack without the need for additional sensor devices. Consequently,
    impedance spectra serve as effective input parameters for predicting the state
    of health of FC. However, so far, authors have not defined or mathematically expressed
    the definition of SOH in FC, but rather presented several parameters, as will
    be explained further on, to benchmark the actual state with past states [58,59].
    Additionally, non-invasive methods have been explored, involving the measurement
    of the magnetic field generated by induced current changes within a stack to detect
    faults in a PEMFC stack. This technique utilizes magnetic sensors placed around
    the stack to measure the magnetic field produced. The general aspect of FC State
    of Health is presented in Figure 8. Figure 8. FC state of health (SOH). In [60],
    a seven-layer process is proposed. The first two layers pertain to data acquisition
    and processing using sensors and transducers. The third and fourth layers focus
    on condition assessment and diagnostics, aiming to assess the system’s state of
    health by detecting internal or external faults and proceeding to isolate them.
    The fifth layer, labeled prognostic, involves predicting the future condition
    based on past actions in a cause-and-effect reaction. The last two layers center
    on the decision-making process, drawing insights from the preceding layers. Furthermore,
    the authors identified the primary degradation mechanism in FC. They advocate
    for the use of behavioral models, such as static/dynamic, mathematical, and hybrid
    approaches (combining physical models with empirical support from Artificial Intelligence)
    as the most effective method for analyzing the state of health. In [61], an accurate
    physics-based aging model is proposed to foresee the degradation evaluation of
    the electrode active surface layer as a function of the operation conditions.
    The model is based on an unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)-based framework, and it
    showed a precision and accuracy of 95%. A more extended review of the FC’s state
    of health has been presented in [57]. The authors identified various monitoring
    parameters and techniques applicable to assessing the SOH in FC applications.
    The first parameter under consideration is the cell voltage. The analysis indicates
    that all fault modes, which will be further explained, result in a voltage drop.
    This is evident in instances such as flooding and drying. Another key parameter
    is impedance. Utilizing EIS allows for the monitoring of the parameter’s evolution,
    aiding in the detection of any signs of accelerated degradation. Thermal stability
    is also a significant parameter for estimating the SOH of the stack. Research
    has demonstrated a correlation between local temperature and local current density.
    Moreover, these parameters exhibit a simultaneous increase when there is a decrease
    in the operating voltage. Additionally, the authors highlight the importance of
    considering other factors such as gas diffusion, membrane degradation, and catalyst
    poisoning in comprehensive SOH assessments. These aspects contribute valuable
    insights into the overall health and performance of the FC system. 5. Fault Diagnostics
    A fault may be defined as the condition of an equipment, material, or system,
    characterized by the termination of the ability to fully perform the required
    functions [62]. It can be categorized into three main classes: catastrophic—characterized
    by a sudden occurrence and involving the total and immediate stoppage of the functions
    performed until then; evolutionary—associated with a gradual development and affecting,
    at first only partially, the performance of the functions; and finally, intentional—deliberately
    caused and involving the interruption of the performance of the functions, regardless
    of the registered condition [62]. The identification of this abnormal condition
    is a critical and necessary task to endeavor to: first, restore the natural order
    of the system, and second, improve the reliability, as well as the feasibility.
    In that regard, it is desired to apply diagnosis tools to identify the fault when
    it is at the beginning of the evolutionary state [62]. Being a multi-physics system
    with complex hardware, FCs are susceptible to the occurrence of faults. Ref. [63]
    classified FCs’ faults in terms of their severity, identifying three types: the
    first, denominated as fatal (or permanent), which occurs mostly on the physical
    structure of the FCs and are irreversible, causing permanent damage to the FCs;
    the second, referred to as transient, is normally associated with FCs’ operating
    conditions or control strategy. They are characterized as being reversible if
    detected in a timely manner. Finally, the third classification is termed external
    faults. This classification occurs mostly in any system that is adjacent to the
    FCs, such as the humidification or cooling system, air supply system, or even
    sensor network. To classify the faults’ reversibility, the determining factor
    is not only reliant on fast identification of it but also on the level of redundancy
    within the system. The next subsections will meticulously examine the different
    faults, via a careful examination of different symptoms, behaviors, and consequences
    for the different severity classifications. Moreover, different diagnostic techniques
    will also be introduced and evaluated for each fault. Following the classification
    of FC faults introduced in [63], Figure 9 introduces the different faults and
    their severity classification. Figure 9. Fuel Cell faults chart. 5.1. Permanent
    Faults Membrane deterioration is typically the catastrophic result of a transient
    fault that involves drying the membrane with consequences such as small cracks
    that appear in the membrane [64,65]. Normally, this fault is a result of the longer
    exposure duration to the transient fault and involves significant alteration in
    the pressure gradients between the cathode and anode channels [63]. Several diagnosis
    methods have been introduced in the literature, particularly in [66], where two
    different strategies are described. The first is not directly related to membrane
    deterioration but rather to the evaluation of the equivalent model parameters
    under faulty conditions, which inevitably will result in membrane failure if no
    action is taken previously. The second approach involves a static approach through
    the available information on each membrane of the stack to detect and adequately
    identify patterns of the fault such as membrane deterioration, flooding, and drying
    [66]. It was concluded that the pressure drop between the cathode and anode is
    suitable for identifying membrane deterioration since for this particular fault
    mode, it is the only parameter model that suffers significant changes [66]. Another
    method employed was reported in [67]. It was concluded that it is possible to
    access the working condition and identify fault occurrence by placing three high-load
    resistances in parallel with the stack and its individual cells. On one hand,
    the power–load resistance curve can be compared with the one provided by the manufacturers,
    working in the same operating conditions, and identify the fault. On the other
    hand, by repeating the same process for the individual cells, it is possible to
    pinpoint which ones are in faulty operation and discriminate which fault is occurring.
    It was also added that, if the output voltage of a single cell is really close
    to zero for the three different high-load resistances, the membrane is completely
    deteriorated, while if the output power of a single cell decreases with the decrease
    in the load resistance, then the porous layer of the single cell is gas-blocked
    or is clogged up by excessive water. Finally, if the opposite occurs, the active
    surface of the catalyst is either corrupted or physically damaged. Even though
    the experimental results on a 12-cell stack validated the proposed hypothesis,
    some concerns are to be pointed out. One of them is the impracticability of the
    proposed method for a numerous-cell stack since it requires a considerable amount
    of time to individually test all cells. To avoid this problem, the authors in
    [68] identified three control groups in a 20-cell stack and measured the voltage
    for each group to identify and categorize the fault. This method is focused on
    flooding or drying of the membrane, which is the prolonged pre-fault state of
    membrane deterioration. This method will be better explained in the water management
    section. Another important technique to identify faults in FCs is the EIS; nevertheless,
    it faces several limitations for numerous cell stacks because of the technological
    limitation of the electrochemical spectrometer [63]. To cope with this limitation,
    the authors in [69] developed a new spectrometer that allows large FCs to be tested
    under different conditions, especially in extreme conditions of the membrane,
    such as high membrane permeability or a reduced active surface layer [63]. Experimental
    results were able to accurately highlight several behaviors of single cells inside
    the stack and were capable of identifying and quantifying hydrogen crossover in
    different cells, concluding that there is a minor variance between the FCs’ membrane
    permeability and the sum of the crossover rates measured for each individual cell.
    Even though this is not an online diagnostic method, its main disadvantage is
    the high production cost of the improved spectrometer. 5.1.1. Absence of Catalyst
    This fault is characterized by a reduction in the catalyst’s active layer, which
    can be caused by excessive water content or physical damage to the catalyst layer
    itself [63]. Moreover, the degradation of fuel cell catalysts not only encompasses
    physical damage but also involves chemical aspects, including the dissolution
    and precipitation of active sites on the catalyst surface, as well as the oxidation
    and reconstruction of the catalytic surface [70]. Often the same diagnostic techniques
    used for membrane deterioration can be applied to this fault; for example, in
    [67], it is noted that if the output power of a single cell increases with the
    decrease in the load resistance, then it is safe to assume that the active surface
    of the catalyst is damaged, but its origin is not identified [63,67]. Another
    degrading agent of the active catalyst layer is the different strict conditions
    in which the catalyst surface must operate, especially for a high level of humidity
    and a high operating temperature [71]. The active catalyst layer is also affected
    by the long operation hours, which causes a continuous decrease in the electrochemically
    active catalyst surface area. Experimental results were presented in [72], where
    a reduction of 20% of the catalyst active surface layer for the same open-circuit
    voltage was observed after the FC was continuously operated for 2000 h. Carbon
    corrosion is a phenomenon known for decreasing 60% of the cathode layer’s thickness,
    and in consequence, reducing the overall active layer, meaning that there is a
    high exchange current density and, as a result, a high activation overpotential
    [71]. Usually, carbon corrosion occurs when the cell cannot produce either enough
    electrons or protons to complete the electrochemical reaction, and therefore portions
    of the catalyst support layer (mostly PT particles) are forced to react to balance
    the equation, resulting in severe and irreversible cell damage [73,74]. The causes
    are usually related to local fuel starvation, uneven current and fuel distribution,
    increased humidity, or excessive temperature [74,75]. More specifically, ref.
    [76] identified that carbon corrosion is the main consequence of anode flooding,
    while ref. [75] emphasized the poor distribution of fuel and exaggerated fuel
    starvation. 5.1.2. CO Poisoning Carbon Monoxide (CO) poisoning is related to the
    purity of hydrogen being supplied to the anode side of the FC [75]. When FCs are
    supplied with impure hydrogen, the hydrocarbons will react with the platinum anode
    catalyst surface, which will reduce the active surface; therefore, a performance
    loss will occur [77,78]. This phenomenon is dependent on the gas content, flow
    rate, humidity, temperature, and time of exposure [75]. The reversibility of this
    type of fault is very dependent on the time of exposure. In fact, [75] identified
    that hydrocarbon poisoning is one of the faults with a longer response time, between
    1 s and a day depending on the level of impurity content present in the fuel.
    As a recovering mechanism, in [79], air bleeding was used. Initially, a 25 c m
    2 single cell was supplied with hydrogen pre-mixed with 53 parts per million (ppm)
    of CO. After less than 20 min of testing, the current witnessed an 80% loss of
    its nominal value. The authors were then able to recover, in less than 1 min,
    90% of the nominal value by air bleeding the anode with 5% of air mixed with the
    contaminated hydrogen. This procedure shows great success because the content
    of oxygen in the fuel mixture will oxidize with the CO and deposited onto the
    catalyst surface, generating C O 2 , which is then expelled, reactivating the
    active surface layer [79]. This study also presents a transient model to estimate
    the current reduction due to CO poisoning and estimate the correct amount of air
    required for a successful recovery. For open-cathode FC, the presence of pollutants,
    such as sulfur dioxide, in the atmospheric air can cause similar problems as the
    one previously explained. To combat and reduce the effect of such pollutants,
    two distinct methods can be applied: either filter the sucked air or perform cyclic
    voltammetry [80]. EIS can be employed to diagnose CO poisoning as shown in [81].
    A mixture of hydrogen with 100 ppm CO was injected into a 23 c m 2 single cell
    and carried a frequency sweep from 10 kHz to 0.050 Hz. Experimental results showed
    an inductive behavior for frequencies below 3 Hz caused by CO poisoning. This
    is due to the reduction in the active surface layer, leading to a competitive
    process between the oxidation of hydrogen and carbon monoxide at the anode [75,81].
    This inductive behavior is more and more noticeable for long-duration exposure
    to CO poisoning [75,81]. The authors in [82] also used EIS to detect CO poisoning.
    They compared two identical FCs with different CO compositions (50 and 100 ppm),
    and at the beginning of the experimental tests, both cells presented the same
    voltage of 0.72 V. After the initial minutes, the one fed a higher ppm of CO showed
    the firsts signs of poisoning by having its voltage dropped to 0.34 V, while the
    second cell took almost 60 min to have its voltage reduced to 0.41 V. Nevertheless,
    after the immediate drop in cell voltage, the results showed that the cell reached
    a stable value [82]. Regarding the EIS test results, the impedance increased for
    frequencies lower than 100 Hz, showing an impedance magnitude value 6 times higher
    than the normal one for the lowest frequency [82]. The same inductive process
    reported in [81] was also seen in [82]. Other solutions to mitigate the effects
    of CO poisoning can be found in [83,84], where the authors increased the operating
    temperature of the FCs to mitigate this effect. Although the method proved to
    be efficient, it can cause other problems arising from the excessive operating
    temperature. A more advanced solution is described in [85], where a high-power
    converter was used to send a pulsing current of a specific amplitude and low frequency,
    which creates an overpotential at the anode to force the CO to electro-oxidize
    into CO2, thus liberating the active surface layer from the irrigated CO. Experimentally,
    a 50% power gain was obtained when a cell was fed hydrogen and CO at 500 ppm [75,85].
    Typically, this fault is more common when the hydrogen production process involves
    the use of fossil fuels as a main source. Even though the risk still exists, in
    today’s context, the use of green hydrogen virtually eliminates the threat of
    contamination from hydrocarbons. The focus regarding catalyst poisoning shifts
    to the cathode side, particularly in open-cathode fuel cells where the cathode
    side is susceptible to contamination from gases like sulfur dioxide present in
    the atmosphere, especially in more polluted areas. 5.1.3. Reactant Leakage As
    the least dense element in the universe, hydrogen systems are prone to leakage.
    Normally, in relatively small quantities, it is harmless; nevertheless, hydrogen
    is flammable, with a colorless flame, and can be very volatile if confined to
    a non-ventilated space. In FCs, hydrogen leakage can occur in the supply system,
    cracked graphite plates, seal valves, or membrane cross-leaks [63,86]. Due to
    the aforementioned concerns, the authors in [87] began to study hydrogen leakages
    in a 1.25 kW FC, arriving at the conclusion that one parameter to take into consideration
    is the water vapor content in the anode, so FC manufacturers should not only implement
    mass flow sensors but also pressure and humidity sensors as well. The last one
    serves only the purpose of eliminating false alarms. The detection technique is
    based on a comparison between the model and the experimental values. The authors
    in [88,89] used physical sensors to measure the open-circuit voltage of the stack’s
    cell and analyze them in different conditions. With these data, they were able
    to detect, in aged cells, hydrogen crossover between the anode and the cathode
    and between the anode and the cooling compartment. Although capable of locating
    damaged cells, this method will necessitate a substantial number of physical sensors
    for implementation in a stack with numerous cells. To detect hydrogen leakage
    between the anode and the cathode, the authors resorted to a signal-based technique
    where the amount of time for each cell to reach a predefined voltage level of
    0.5 V after the hydrogen supply was cut off was measured [88,89]. After collecting
    the required data, they concluded that some cells reached the predefined value
    faster than others. Those that require more time to reach the predefined voltage
    present less probability of presenting hydrogen leakage between the two electrodes.
    To ensure the correct detection of the fault, a probability curve is calculated.
    In the second approach to anode/cooling hydrogen leakage, the relationship between
    the reactant gas flow and the water level in the expansion vessel was calculated
    [88,89]. Unfortunately, this technique is more complicated to implement on an
    open-cathode FC because, usually, a cooling compartment is not necessary. Another
    work, involving reactant leakage, used a well-established computational model
    and included different faults, such as air leakage. To diagnose the fault, relative
    fault sensitivity of the different faults has been used [90,91,92]. Using model-based
    methods, in [93], six different faults were diagnosed, including air leakage,
    by calculating residual sensitivity parameters to distinguish the faults. After
    that, a theoretical matrix was developed, with the sensitivity parameters in the
    rows and the faults in the columns [93]. An online fault monitoring was developed
    in [94]. The hydrogen leakage is identified through an abrupt variation of the
    hydrogen pressure controller and the hydrogen mass flow meter. They used this
    approach because hydrogen leakage is normally associated with cracks or fractures
    in the membrane caused by temperature hot spots and mechanical stress when the
    FC is operated under dynamic load operation. Other works that also involve hydrogen
    mass flow and pressure sensors are summarized in [10]. They analyzed the flow
    rate at different points in the pipeline and combined that information with the
    output power of the stack. Cooling pipe leakage has also been reported in water-cooled
    stacks, which is noted by an abrupt increase in the internal humidity of the FC.
    Reactant leakage, especially hydrogen leakage, may have originated from a fault
    in the injection system or from a consequence of membrane deterioration. The latter
    is a tragic consequence of poor water management of the cell. Therefore, to identify
    and then isolate hydrogen reactant leakage faults, the techniques should focus
    on mass flow rate and pressure variation between the injection system and anode
    intake. Some authors might consider hydrogen leakage a transient fault; however,
    in the present work, hydrogen leakage is considered a reactant problem, which
    can be the result of a cracked membrane and is considered the most extreme permanent
    fault in FC. 5.1.4. Fuel Cell Aging The aging of the materials in the FC is inevitable;
    every material is limited to several working cycles and operating conditions.
    Considering this, several works are presented in this subsection. In [95], EIS
    was employed to provide information on the dynamic behavior of the FC operating
    time and its remaining lifetime, and then combine it with a pattern recognition
    tool. This tool used an empirical model to extract and track the evolution of
    the polarization curve, and, at the same time, a latent regression model was used
    to split the imaginary part and approximate it by polynomials. Experimental results
    were able to predict accurately the ageing trajectory, obtaining an error of 21.4%
    on 1000 h operated FC, and after perfecting the proposed tool, the error decreased
    to 9.5%. Both the pattern recognition and EIS tools continued to be improved in
    [96]. With the new models and improved EIS techniques, the reported error was
    reduced to only 2 h out of the 1000 h. The ripple content caused by the power
    converter can have a negative impact on FC aging; nonetheless, the real impact
    on the FC is not well understood at this moment. For example, the authors in [97]
    studied the effect of high-frequency ripple currents on a five-cell stack. The
    simulation results showed that the current ripple does not have a significant
    impact on local conditions; however, the model used was very rudimental, and other
    different parameters must be considered to understand the effect of ripple on
    an FC. In opposition, ref. [98] stated that the current ripple in the FC causes
    an unbalanced heat distribution in the FC, which leads to the occurrence of hot
    spots, causing faster degradation. The current ripple has also been used to assess
    the state of health of the FC: in [54], the ripple was used to calculate the internal
    resistance of the FC. The authors were able to use the simple Ohm’s law recurring
    for the voltage and current ripple because the equivalent electric model of the
    FC for high frequency is reduced to the internal resistance of the FC. Another
    study [55], which used the current ripple, showed that it is possible to resort
    to the oscillations introduced by the power electronics converter, in particular
    the buck and buck-boost, to estimate the parameters involved in the activation
    zone of the polarization curve. Analyzing the evolution of FC aging also implies
    that one must submit the FC to extreme conditions. One of the first studies considering
    FC aging is presented in [56], where two types of aging constraints were exploited.
    On the one hand, the stack was studied for steady-state operation for a 1000 h
    duration time, while on the other hand, the stack was operated for a cyclic load
    for the same duration. EIS and Nyquist plots were used to study the effects. In
    [99], two different aging tests were conducted: the first submitted the FC to
    an extreme temperature of 300 °C and analyzed its polarization curve after 24
    h. The experimental results showed increased degradation from the nominal polarization
    curve. The activation losses and the ohmic losses seem to be the ones that suffered
    from the severe influence since the mass concentration losses are not visible
    in the results. In the second test, the FC was submitted to 24 h operation at
    over the limit current, meaning that there is an excessive water content being
    produced at the cathode. Overall, these two tests suggest that excessive temperature
    and current can cause severe aging in the FC. FC aging depends not only on the
    conditions in which the FC operates but also on the dynamic cyclic load operation.
    Accelerated aging can only be prevented if control of all the systems is optimized
    or if the lifetime expectancy of the different materials is also improved. Regarding
    the former, optimizing the hydrogen intake system, cooling system, water management
    system, and power converter efficiency must be the engineers’ main focus. 5.2.
    Transient Fault Transient faults are related to the currently operating state
    of the FC and the control system. Their feature is their reversibility; nonetheless,
    as stated in the previous subsection, most of the identified permanent faults
    have their origin in a transient fault, especially those related to water management.
    5.2.1. Water Management Concerning water management, two major concepts must be
    mentioned, and they are drying and flooding. The former is characterized by the
    lack of water content in the membrane, while the latter is the opposite, namely,
    the excess water content inside the membrane [100]. If the water content inside
    the cell is not optimized, the protons, which are moving through the hydrated
    parts of the membrane, cannot successfully cross the protonic membrane. Furthermore,
    the clear sign of this fault is a decrease in the electric power, but other symptoms
    are not shared, such as the case of a pressure drop at the cathode, which is only
    noticeable for flooding [101]. Cell design (GDL effect) It is undeniable that
    the water content inside the PEMFC has been the major focus of FC engineers and
    researchers over the past 20 years, with early work dating back to the 1900s;
    for example, in [102], the water movement inside the stack was analyzed for the
    first time. As is represented in Figure 10, it is named electro-osmotic drag when
    the water moves across the electrolyte membrane from the anode to the cathode
    and back-diffusion transport for the opposite water movement [103]. The goal was
    to determine the water content and how it correlates with proton conductivity
    in Nafion membranes for open-cathode FCs and closed-cathode FCs. Figure 10. Water
    movement inside the Fuel Cell membrane. Following the previous work, ref. [104]
    started to look for water management techniques that could improve the efficiency
    of the stack. For that, experiments were conducted on an SOFC, and several water
    management solutions were identified such as system design (especially MEA design),
    stack operating conditions, and external hardware accessories. It was identified
    that the operation of the cell at high current density is related to the optimal
    operating point. This point is also correlated with the maximum generation of
    water. To show this effect, the authors experimentally obtained the polarization
    curve with and without the water management control technique. The results showed
    that the greater benefit of applying such control is obtained at high current
    densities. Even though the MEA design reconfiguration technique showed promising
    results, the authors also stated that this alone will not be sufficient to guarantee
    the proper optimal operation in different conditions. Therefore, new methods are
    to be explored to improve the efficiency of MEA design reconfiguration. Following
    the MEA design and the determination of how materials can improve the performance
    of the FC, poly tetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coating was first mentioned in [105].
    This method has been used since then and it consists of implanting microspheres
    of this hydrophobic material on the surface of the electrode; in this way, any
    excess water content is repelled, therefore mitigating the effect of excess water.
    Moreover, the authors in [106] compiled several studies that show the benefit
    of coating not only the electrodes but also the treatment of the GDL and the catalyst
    layer. The identified advantages showed a better distribution of the reactants
    in the membrane, an enhanced mechanical compatibility between layers, an improved
    local current distribution, and an efficient wicking of the liquid water [107,108].
    The authors in [109] also followed this line of thought and studied the influence
    of anode GDL wettability on water balance on the anode side. Typically, the anode
    side does not generate water; nonetheless, due to the back-diffusion phenomena,
    water can be present on the anode side causing catastrophic consequences, such
    as carbon corrosion. To access the anode side, a transparent polycarbonate plate
    was placed outside of the anode current collector, so it was possible to take
    optical pictures. Two treated GDL membranes, one with hydrophobic PTFE and the
    other without any treatment (causing it to be hydrophilic), were used at different
    current densities, such as 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 A/Cm 2 ), at different hydrogen flow
    rates and temperatures. The first experimental results were taken after 60 min
    of exposure to the different conditions. Related to the hydrophobic GDL, water
    droplets were observed for low current densities (0.2 A/Cm 2 ), but clogging was
    not observed because the exposure time was too short. When repeated for higher
    current densities, no water droplets were observed on the anode, meaning that
    anode flooding is more prone to occur at low current densities. Furthermore, to
    access the effect of doping the GDL, a lighting technique was used, and the results
    showed that, despite having water droplets on the anode side, the GDL did not
    present any sign of it, meaning that the water content was a result of water condensation
    on the channel surfaces. That could be mitigated if the hydrogen intake is increased
    slightly or if the temperature is also increased. The clogging phenomenon was
    registered after repeating the experience with a longer exposure time (2 h) for
    the lowest current density value. This is due to the fact that the hydrogen flow
    rate is too low to be able to remove the water droplets. All in all, the paper
    presents a relationship between the water content on the anode side and the current
    density, concluding that anode flooding can be prevented if the FC is operated
    at higher current densities levels or if the plate’s temperature is discreetly
    increased. Another work focusing on the GDL influence on anode flooding is presented
    in [110]. The authors varied both reactant humidity and gas composition on four
    different commercially available GDLs. To compare the different GDLs, different
    humidity levels were introduced to the reactants at a constant current. The findings
    demonstrate that a decrease in the humidity levels results in a decrease in the
    overall efficiency, which is explained by the increase in the membrane resistance.
    Overall, the paper concludes that for low levels of inlet humidity, membrane humidification
    is affected, while cathode flooding is also dependent on the inlet humidity level.
    The accumulation of water droplets in the flow channels of the flow field can
    cause blockage of the reactants on the electrodes, causing an increase in the
    concentration loss, and therefore reducing the overall efficiency of the FC. To
    avoid that, a new diagnostic method was proposed in [111]. The idea is to analyze
    the frequencies present in the pressure drop across the flow channels resorting
    to frequency analysis through Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Although the pressure
    drop signal itself can be used for the identification of flooding in the cell,
    it is severely affected by high air flow rates. The findings reported that peaks
    higher than 1 Hz in the dominant frequency are an indication of water removal
    in droplets, meaning that most of the water is still inside the cell, while lower
    peaks, ranging from 0.3 to 0.8 Hz are more characteristic of water removal in
    the form of a stream, therefore representing better removability of water. Furthermore,
    the magnitude of the dominant frequency peak was also reported to be an indication
    of the water droplet size. Despite showing promising results, the technique requires
    at least one sensor (per individual cell) inside the cell, which adds complexity
    to the design of the cell. Also, the technique has only been tested on a single
    cell with low current densities, so it needs further development. To properly
    manage water movement in the PEMFC, an optimal point between adequate membrane
    hydration and avoidance of water at either the catalyst layers or GDL must be
    obtained. This point is typically obtained by externally humidifying the reactant
    before entering the stack; however, for certain operating conditions, such as
    low temperatures, high humidification levels, or high current densities, it can
    cause the inside of the cell to become oversaturated with water vapor and condensation
    is likely to happen, blocking the active layer of the catalyst. GDL itself represents
    a critical component, which requires proper design. Ref. [106] presents a summary
    of the effects of flooding in GDL and their main functions, like access to reactant
    gases, water removal, electronic and heat conductivity, and mechanical strength
    [106]. Flooding/drying The first experimental test concerning the evaluation of
    water distribution in the anode as a function of temperature and current density
    was presented in [112]. The authors changed the back plate of the cathode to be
    able to perform infrared spectroscopy. Experimental results were performed on
    an open-cathode FC with an active cell area of 2025 m m 2 at three different levels
    of air flow rates. At the lower level of air flow rate, the current produced was
    3.8 A with a mean temperature of 36.2 °C, and the results showed that the regions
    with a higher water content presented a higher temperature than the non-flooded
    area. For the inter-medium level of the air flow rate, the current drawn was 4.7
    A, and flooding was only observed in the middle cells. Once again, the same results
    regarding temperature distribution can also be observed, and regions with higher
    flooded areas present a higher temperature. Finally, for the extreme level of
    air flow, the current drawn is 5.5 A. Surprisingly, the results showed no presence
    of water or at least no signs of flooded channels. The authors tried to find an
    explanation for this phenomenon by guessing that it could be a measurement error
    or a consequence of high-temperature gradients resulting from the high current
    densities, which hinder water’s condensation. This last argument is supported
    by the registered temperature of 37.5 °C. Referring to the use of neutron imaging
    to understand the phenomenon of cathode flooding, the authors in [52] concluded
    that this process is initially caused by water droplets retained at GDL, which
    evolve to a critical point and then water flooding occurs. A similar work can
    also be found in [53]. A more easy-to-implement technique was proposed in [113].
    The authors identified and monitored the relationship between cathode pressure
    and internal cell resistance with the occurrence of flooding and drying. They
    concluded that an increase in the pressure drop, particularly in an open-cathode
    FC, is related to cell flooding, while an increase in cell resistance is an indicator
    of FC drying. Moreover, the correlation between these two parameters can be used
    in deciding on corrective actions. Experiments were conducted on a three-cell
    stack, and both a milliohm-meter and pressure sensors were employed to measure
    the internal resistance and the cathode pressure drop, respectively. To first
    verify the relationship between the cathode pressure drop and the mass flow rate
    with different humidification levels, tests were conducted with no current. The
    results show a linear relationship between these two parameters. Additionally,
    the pressure drop is higher for high levels of the cold air mass flow rate and
    even higher for air with 100% air humidity, with the current being drawn from
    the FC. Regarding drying, this phenomenon occurs when the humidification temperature
    decreases well below the stack operating temperature [113]. This can be observed
    by an increase in the pressure drop and the continuous increase in cell resistance.
    Continuing with the cathode pressure drop for water management, other similar
    work was introduced in [114]. For that, a transparent PEMFC was used. The technique
    employed a pressure drop between the anode and the cathode to monitor the water
    accumulation. The increase in the pressure drop is a sign of excessive water content,
    while a sharp decrease corresponds to the expulsion of water content. With the
    theory verified through experimental results, it is possible to optimize the fan
    velocity for optimal water removal. The main conclusion defined that the velocity
    of air should never be lower than 2.3 and 5 m/s for 600, 1000, and 1200 mA/cm
    2 , respectively. Although both works in [113,114] show concurring results and
    an easy-to-implement diagnostic tool, the pressure drop alone shows some drawbacks
    when confronted with load changes. When that happens, the hydrogen flow changes
    accordingly; thereafter, so does the pressure. The conventional EIS has also been
    applied in several studies for the identification of drying and flooding faults
    [115,116,117]. A particular study using EIS, where a specified frequency occurred
    for identification of the flooding or drying, was presented in [118]. The experiments
    were conducted on a single cell with a 10 c m 2 active area with the admission
    of both pure hydrogen and oxygen. For the flooding state, the Nyquist plot showed
    an increase in both imaginary and real axes, as the water accumulated on the cathode
    side. At the same time, the real part of the graph started to increase, and the
    graph started to move slightly to the right while keeping the same format because
    of the increase in the membrane resistance [118]. Furthermore, as the level of
    water content in the cathode increased, the diameter of the semicircle changed
    due to the decrease in temperature. Regarding the drying state, similar experiments
    were conducted and the Nyquist plot results showed the appearance of another semicircle
    in the low-frequency region, which is followed by an increase in the magnitude
    of both imaginary and real axes [118]. Additionally, a negative slope in the magnitude
    response was reported, opposite to what was registered for the normal and flooding
    state; henceforth, authors concluded that it would be possible to establish a
    difference between the operation modes: the drying and flooding. Finally, an empirical
    model based on the electrical equivalent circuit was proposed, and a mitigation
    algorithm was defined. Although this was one of the first papers to identify and
    propose a mitigation algorithm, it did not identify only the fault, so no restoring
    mechanism of the state was implemented. Nonetheless, by independently controlling
    the power switches of the cascade connection between boost and buck converters,
    the authors prevented the occurrence of the fault and improved cell efficiency.
    The input current was controlled by the boost side of the converter, while the
    buck was responsible for keeping the output voltage constant. To improve the efficiency
    of the cell, a step change in the input current of 2 A, regardless of the actual
    current value, was performed every two minutes. 5.2.2. Fuel Starvation The starvation
    phenomena may be a consequence of flooding but also may be caused by a defect
    in the reactant supply system. Nonetheless, starvation can occur on a local or
    global level if there is any kind of reactant undersupply [71]. Local starvation
    is typically associated with self-humidification techniques employed by FC manufacturers,
    which resort to an instantaneous short-circuit to humidify the membrane. In this
    case, there is an irregular supply of reactants, which causes starvation, but
    it does not affect the overall current to the load. Imposingly, global starvation
    is caused by a defect in the supply of one of the reactants, and therefore the
    power demand is not fulfilled [71,75]. Typically, starvation is more related to
    the cathode side, because normally, it is a result of a malfunction in the air-feeding
    system; regardless, the anode side can also be susceptible to fuel starvation.
    In fact, as concluded in [119,120], extreme hydrogen starvation has more catastrophic
    consequences than extreme oxygen starvation. In [119,120] a compilation of different
    works related to fuel starvation is presented. The authors identified that starvation
    is not only related to an external fault but can also be caused by the dynamics
    of the stack. For example, during sudden load changes or improper start-up conditions,
    hydrogen or oxygen starvation can occur. The slow dynamics of the stack, where
    the mass transfer cannot accompany the load change, is the cause behind the starvation.
    Regarding hydrogen starvation, it was noted that complete hydrogen starvation
    induces high potential, which leads to carbon corrosion, and mathematically, this
    is translated to the inequality between the hydrogen molar flow and the ratio
    between the current and the double of the Faraday’s constant. Moreover, when there
    is only partial hydrogen starvation, or local starvation, the current requirements
    are satisfied but the fuel distribution is not homogenous in the GDL. For this
    case, the mathematical expression is the same as the previous one, as long as
    the current per area of the stack is higher than the maximum current density.
    The authors in [121,122] worked on global starvation caused by a malfunction in
    the air supply fan on an open-cathode FC. The consequences of such a breakdown
    will typically result in water accumulation on the cathode, which itself causes
    local starvation and reduces the air supplied, causing global starvation. The
    first case is simulated by an empirical formula that considers several parameters
    in the healthy state: the volume of water accumulated and an empirical constant
    that represents the electrode’s flooding. The second case is also simulated using
    an empirical formula, which represents the air stoichiometry for the healthy and
    faulty states. The employed algorithm is based on a Bayesian Network (BN) that
    considers several inputs, such as stack voltage and current, temperature, air
    flow, and accumulated water. Simulation results showed that when the air stoichiometry
    is reduced to values close to 1, the voltage and current undergo an immediate
    decrease until they reach a plateau. However, once the accumulated water parameter
    reaches a certain value (in this case, 0.05 L) or higher, both the current and
    voltage start to decrease exponentially. This is because the accumulated water
    starts to cause local starvation in the different cells of the stacks, meaning
    that the supplied reactants cannot react. A different approach to this problem
    is reported in [123]. More focused on the output power of a single stack, several
    coupling strategies between small power stacks were conducted, creating a multi-system
    that the authors referred to as a multi-stack. The authors concluded that a series
    connection between stacks is advantageous, especially when paired with antiparallel
    by-pass diodes, which allow for fault tolerance if needed. The results showed
    good coupling between the two stacks, and when the fault was registered, the anti-parallel
    bypass diode strategy was able to bypass the faulty stack while ensuring that
    the load current remained constant. It is important to note that the starvation
    phenomenon is noted by a sudden voltage decrease. After some experiments to ensure
    the correct coupling between the stacks, an EIS test was performed. The results
    showed no significant difference between the healthy and faulty modes. No particular
    attention was given to this situation; however, it is safe to say that due to
    the time associated with starvation (as introduced in [75]), no immediate effect
    is measured. As previously mentioned, if starvation is not detected rapidly, it
    will lead to permanent damage, such as carbon corrosion. The continuation of the
    previous work is represented in [124], where the same principle is applied to
    a 500 W FC system, equipped with two 20-cell FC stacks. The experimental results
    proved to be congruent with what was initially foreseen, and a strategy to operate
    an FC system under degraded mode is validated. In order to gain a deeper understanding
    of the impact of fuel starvation and develop accurate diagnostic tools, a comprehensive
    study was conducted utilizing EIS techniques [125]. These experiments were performed
    on an open-cathode FC composed of 47 cells with a nominal power and voltage of
    1200 W and 26 V, respectively. For this FC model, hydrogen is supplied at a constant
    pressure of 9.5 bars, while oxygen is fed at atmospheric pressure. Concerning
    air stoichiometry, its reliance is on the ongoing current production. Subsequently,
    an excessively high value has the potential to dry the membrane or flood the cathode.
    Conversely, maintaining a low air stoichiometry can lead to air starvation. Hence,
    the authors considered two operating conditions: the first, where the stack current
    is operated at a constant value of 10 A, and a second scenario for a higher value
    of current equal to 30 A. After calculating the correct value of the oxygen stoichiometry
    for the first case, the authors proceed to the EIS under different values. When
    the stoichiometry falls below the recommended threshold, the data points exhibit
    increased fluctuations, causing expansion in the low-frequency loop. This expansion
    results in elevated mass transportation losses, potentially leading to cathode
    flooding or instances of local starvation. The interesting result appeared when
    the air-stoichiometry rate was increased to values double and triple that of the
    normal one. In these instances, the low-frequency mass transportation semi-loop
    diminishes, giving way to the anticipated semi-loop at high frequencies. This
    high-frequency semi-loop signifies the charge transfer process, and it is indicative
    of the drying phenomenon. However, no significant difference between the healthy
    and the faulty state was reported, meaning that this membrane is not affected
    by high air stoichiometry [123,125]. The second case represents similar results,
    and thus the same conclusions. The proposed diagnosis technique is similar to
    the one already explained for water management [126], based on fuzzy c-means clustering.
    The simulation results showed correct feature selection and extraction, but further
    implementation on a real FC is required to validate the proposed diagnosis tool.
    Regarding the operating conditions at a high air stoichiometry ratio, the conclusions
    in [123,125] were not observed in [127]. In this last paper, the effect of high
    air stoichiometry on an open-cathode FC is accessed. Initially, a certain agreement
    between the mentioned works is obtained, with authors in [127] stating that for
    relatively higher air flow (almost double the proper value), the performance of
    the FC increased because the distribution of air is more homogeneous through the
    stack and, thus, more oxygen is available to react. Also, the excess air helps
    to exhaust any water droplet formation. However, when air stoichiometry increased
    to higher values, a significant decrease in the stack voltage was reported, and
    an increase in temperature of almost 2 °C was reported. The cause of such voltage
    degradation is explained by the drying conditions of the membranes caused by the
    excess of air; thereafter, normal conditions can be restored if the membrane is
    properly humidified. All in all, operating the stack at high air stoichiometry
    ratios can cause irreversible voltage damage. It was also observed that at high
    air stoichiometry, the pressure between the inlet and outlet differed because
    the outlet pressure decreased. Moreover, these degrading conditions can cause
    notable oscillations in the temperature and humidity. With that consideration
    in mind, the paper proposes a diagnosis method based on the Discrete Wavelet Transform.
    This signal processing tool is applied to the voltage and pressure signals acquired
    for the healthy and faulty state. After that, the high frequencies of the signal
    are analyzed through their energy and entropy content, which are generated to
    access the SOH of the FC system. To pinpoint exactly which cells are being most
    affected by the fault, three distinct input signals are considered: the air drop
    pressure between the inlet and outlet, the stack voltage, and the individual cell
    voltages. Experimental results showed the evolution of the energy and entropy
    of the high frequencies for different operating conditions. The difficulties involved
    in measuring the amount of oxygen being consumed at the cathode side for an open-cathode
    Fuel Cell present one of the problems with actual air-feeding systems. To solve
    this, the authors in [128] inferred this variable using another variable, such
    as the case of the compressor’s air mass flow. This variable is more accessible
    and measurable. Furthermore, the theoretical value of the oxygen flow consumed
    can be calculated by using the stack’s current, the molar mass of the oxygen,
    the number of cells, and Faraday’s constant. Moreover, presenting an alternative
    way to refer to oxygen stoichiometry, the paper also presents a fault-tolerant
    technique to avoid starvation phenomena. The authors used a set number of controllers,
    also called Un-falsified Control (UC), where the control law is set depending
    on a set of input/output data. With this approach, they were able to control the
    oxygen stoichiometry rate while avoiding any faulty states. To achieve that, the
    control input is the theoretical value of the oxygen flow consumed and the compressor’s
    air mass flow, while the output is the compressor’s voltage. Several experimental
    scenarios were reported, for the faulty scenario several faults are considered,
    such as the case of flow blockage and flow leak. To identify the fault, a cathode
    pressure sensor is inserted, and its evolution is tracked for the different conditions.
    For the case of flow blockage, the cathode pressure increases, and the control
    increases the compressor’s voltage to restore to the normal value, while for the
    case of the flow leak, the cathode pressure was not affected, but rather the compressor
    voltage changed. Regardless of the case, the proposed switched control was able
    to regulate the oxygen flow to restore normal conditions. It is important to note
    that despite the cathode pressure being a valid parameter for the identification
    of oxygen starvation, it alone may infer misleading conclusions. As analyzed for
    cathode flooding, its pressure was also used and concluded that an increase in
    its measured pressure means that the cathode is flooded. So, for this case, the
    control might need to be readjusted to avoid flooding and not starvation. Another
    fault-tolerant control based on a modified super-twisting sliding mode is presented
    in [129]. Here, the control is dimensioned taking into consideration the dynamic
    behavior of the cathode partial pressure, the air supply manifold dynamics, and
    the compressor dynamics. The residual signals are generated by comparing the model’s
    output to the observers. After that, the observer is responsible for identifying
    the fault and the presence of external disturbances, and finally, reconstructing
    the system. Another similar work can be found in [130]. As stated in the present
    work, FCs can be fed pure oxygen or air, with the principal difference being the
    percentage of oxygen in each of those forms. Obviously, both require different
    cathode feeding systems and rely mostly on user choice. A comparison between the
    influence of cathode stoichiometry for the two cases has been assessed in [131].
    The work intends to identify how the cathode stoichiometry level affects the stack’s
    performance. It is concluded that, for air-fed FCs, the assumed minimum stoichiometry
    level is 2. Even though this value is dependent on the temperature and current,
    according to the authors, it corresponds to a balance between correctness, efficiency,
    and economy of the FC when it is operated at the rated power [131]. For air-fed
    FC, the injected air also has the function of expelling water from the cathode.
    Conversely, it was concluded that on pure oxygen stacks, lowering the stoichiometry
    value as low as 1.25 would not cause any voltage degradation. Only when subsiding
    below 1.1 did some degradation appear in some cells. Despite the presented findings,
    there are several drawbacks: firstly, the duration of the experiment is not sufficient
    for water accumulation on the cathode side; secondly, there was no mention of
    load change, which is directly affected by air stoichiometry, and thirdly, lowering
    the stoichiometry ratio as the authors did will cause the stack to work as a “hydrogen
    pump”, which is because the protons that are migrating through the membrane are
    going to react with their electron pairs that had just flowed through the external
    circuit. 5.2.3. Short Circuit Short-circuit conditions, also referred to as operation
    under high-current conditions, occur specifically on self-humidify open-cathode
    fuel cells. This system involves a frequent auto short-circuit with a duration
    of milliseconds that stimulates water production inside the stack. However, if
    not currently controlled, those conditions can cause irreversible conditions,
    such as melting of the electrodes and accelerated aging. Moreover, high current
    peaks, even during short periods of time, generate hot stops in the membrane and
    can cause water accumulation in the cathode [74]. Beneficial effects of short-term
    duration short circuits have been noted in [75]. The authors claim that the production
    of momentary large quantities of water reduces ohmic losses and cleanses the electrons’
    active surface layer of any oxygen deposits, resulting in an overall increase
    in the system’s performance. To assess the operation of the stack under both short-circuit
    conditions and high current densities, the authors in [74,132] analyzed the coupling
    behavior between a Fuel Cell and an Ultra-Capacitor (UC). The first experiment
    was conducted on a 3-cell stack FC with an open-circuit voltage of 2.64 V, while
    the UC voltage was very similar, with a value of 2.7 V. Initially, the UC was
    completely discharged, and the fuel cell current was measured. The charging current
    was approximately 80 A, and the FC was forced to operate in the concentration
    loss zone of the polarization curve. A similar experiment was conducted, but this
    time on a stack with 16 cells. The results showed that the FC voltage drop was
    not so abrupt, but the UC charging time was higher because of the UC’s higher
    voltage. A second experiment focused on the auto-humidified system was conducted.
    Despite showing an increase in the stack voltage, the EIS showed no significant
    difference between the cases with and without the auto-humidify system. Nonetheless,
    a more thorough analysis of the individual cell voltage showed that the cells
    further from the hydrogen inlet presented a high voltage drop during short-circuit
    conditions. This is caused by the slow dynamics of the FC and the challenge of
    hydrogen reaching cells farthest from the hydrogen inlet. Further studies on this
    effect are required since there was no mention of operating the stack with the
    auto humidification system and the UC, particularly during operation with subcritical
    loads. In extreme conditions, short circuits can also occur within the cell’s
    electrodes. A phenomenon referred to as fuel crossover happens when either hydrogen
    or oxygen can penetrate the membrane, creating an internal leakage. Radicals of
    oxygen and hydrogen can be formed and corrupt the membrane’s structures, thus
    creating a short circuit. The authors in [120] were able to detect internal short
    circuits and hydrogen crossover by resorting to a well-suited Fuel Cell diagnostic
    tool, referred to as Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV). LSV is an electro-analytical
    method that measures the current at the electrode while its potential is swept
    linearly in time. When analyzing the results in the presence of an internal short-circuit,
    a positive slope above the swept value of 0.25 V was registered. 5.3. Hardware/External
    Faults These types of faults are the ones with less work reported in the literature.
    This is because almost all external components are very conventional and not specifically
    designed for Fuel Cell applications [63,133,134]. Furthermore, this category is
    very dependent on the type of FC being used, and which external components are
    required. Nonetheless, in [135] a diagnostic system technique was proposed for
    detecting faults in the FC system sensor’s network. This diagnostic technique
    was implemented on a bus fleet at the Shanghai Expo in 2010 and is based on Principal
    Component Analysis (PCA). This model-based tool takes into consideration the sensors’
    information under normal working conditions by using the relevance of process
    variables and tests the divergence of samples and the model online [135]. A total
    of 17 sensors were modeled and the result showed the good capability of the system
    to identify the fault and isolate it. Further research on sensor rehabilitation
    is available in [136], where the authors concentrated on identifying faulty humidity
    sensors that hinder the accurate detection of water flooding. The data tool uses
    several data-based approaches, such as Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA),
    Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT), and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). The tool
    was implemented in an 80 W open-cathode FC, and the experimental procedure involved
    cooling down the stack to cause cathode flooding and immediately increasing the
    temperature to mitigate the effect. With such a procedure, four different datasets
    were created: from normal to flooding conditions, from flooding conditions to
    normal conditions, normal conditions, and finally flooding to normal conditions.
    The proposed approach is then to monitor the sensor’s measurements every 5 s and
    check for reliability regarding the features extracted from each sensor. The experimental
    results showed that without considering the humidity sensor fault, the diagnosis
    data tool could not detect cathode flooding, while when faulty humidity was removed
    from the data, the tool easily identified cathode flooding. Finally, when referring
    to external faults, serious attention must be paid to power electronics components.
    Despite falling out of the scope of this paper, some work has already covered
    a significant part of this field [137,138,139,140]. 6. Diagnostic Tools As previously
    stated, the transient fault classification class is the most suitable and desired
    for the application of diagnostic tools. Given this, the authors in [75] identified
    several diagnostic approaches and compiled them in a tree-like graph. Figure 11
    illustrates the organization of the diagnostic tools. Figure 11. Diagnostic tool
    fault-tree-like graph. Originally, Figure 11 only accounted for data- and residual-based
    classification, but adding knowledge-based classification is important because,
    to evolve into a more adaptative and robust method, it is necessary to truly understand
    the system by intensively experimenting with it. Despite being a very limited
    diagnostic tool, the knowledge-based approach is founded on logic and reason,
    where a conclusion is reached through several observations. An example of this
    approach is Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) [141]. This technique is basically action–consequence
    knowledge that uses deduction, which allows the relationship between an undesired
    state to cross reference low-level events via a top-down approach. Residual-based
    approaches compare the healthy state of the FCs, through their model, to the real
    system measurement. The difference, also called residuals, is analyzed to detect
    the fault occurrence and, at the same time, specify the fault [75]. Finally, data-based
    approaches use data processing techniques and rely only on the input and output
    of the system to identify fault occurrence [75]. Data are then collected and analyzed
    by verifying the distance between faulty operating conditions and the nominal
    operating point to take the necessary diagnostic actions [75]. Another important
    distinction made in [62] is related to the way in which fault diagnostic tools
    are applied. The authors categorized them off-line and on-line. The former requires
    the FC to be out of service, and in most cases, to be dismantled to access specific
    components, while the latter can perform diagnosis without the need to interrupt
    the operation of the FC. Therefore, the development of online diagnosis methods
    has attracted more interest. Regarding on-line methods, they can also be classified
    as invasive and non-invasive [62]. One of the most studied diagnostic techniques
    involves measuring the individual stack voltage and accompanying the voltage difference
    between them and the time evolution [142,143]. Other techniques involve more invading
    methods such as Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) [144,145], while
    others opt for more model-based techniques through the use of residuals and hysteresis
    windows [91,145,146] or even data-driven [147,148] and signal processing tools
    [149,150,151,152,153,154]. 6.1. Residual-Based Approaches Figure 12 illustrates
    the concept of residuals. The approach involves generating an error by comparing
    data measured through hardware-installed sensors with a computational model that
    simulates or estimates normal behavior. Subsequently, the residuals are compared
    with a predefined threshold window, acting as a barometer. Values falling beyond
    this window are considered indicative of faulty conditions. Figure 12. Residual
    formation and classification. Residual-based diagnostic tools can be applied on-line
    or off-line, depending on the definition of the tool. Some of the off-line methods
    have already been presented in Section 4 (for example, [91,129,130,145,146]);
    however, in recent works, several online techniques have been receiving a lot
    of attention due to the ability of real-time implementation, early-stage fault
    detection, and preventive maintenance of the system. Consequently, these approaches
    aim to prevent system malfunctions or total failures, ultimately enhancing system
    reliability. Some of the recent works have been summarized in [155]. In [156],
    an on-line method was employed to ensure proper humidification of the stack. The
    authors used a DC/DC power converter to interface with the FC, and with the proper
    sensors and control of the converter, they were able to measure the harmonic impedance
    for different conditions, such as faults related to membrane humidification and
    low mass flow of reactants for constant load. The DC/DC converter used was an
    isolated full-bridge converter with a capacitor placed in parallel with the FC
    to minimize the current harmonics. Resorting to the control of the converter,
    the on-line method proposed is based on the EIS methodology. The EIS principle,
    as already explained, requires a small perturbation in the input of the FC, and
    the authors have achieved this by causing small sinusoidal modulation at different
    frequencies around the nominal value of the duty cycle. To ensure that this perturbation
    does not affect the output voltage, the method can only be employed when the dynamical
    conditions of the load are sufficiently low to disable the output voltage control.
    Furthermore, to inject the signal into the FC, a current ripple injection controller
    had to be dimensioned by simply measuring the current of the stack, extracting
    the alternating part of the signal, and adding it to the reference current ripple.
    The generated response is then added to the constant duty cycle. Having ensured
    proper operation of the methods, the authors measured both FC voltage and current,
    performed a frequency-adjusted division to eliminate the PWM ripple component,
    and proceeded to apply a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). All in all, the proposed
    online tool can detect a fault; however, an increase in high impedance is also
    a sign of membrane flooding or drying, and therefore this tool needs to be enhanced.
    A similar work is presented in [54]. The idea is based on calculating the impedance
    using only the ripple produced by the converter, in this case, a boost converter.
    Knowing that the internal resistance is a good indicator of the humidification
    level of the membrane, and that, for high frequencies, the electric equivalent
    circuit can be reduced to only the resistance part, the authors extracted the
    DC component of the voltage and the current signals and divided them. The proposed
    method was experimentally tested on a closed cathode FC, with external air being
    fed to simulate bad humidification and therefore causing drying to the membrane.
    The results showed that the internal resistance increased when the external air
    was supplied, thus diminishing the level of humidification of the membrane. Once
    again, a diagnostic tool using just the power converter is proposed; nonetheless,
    as was shown in [156], gas mass flow can also affect the internal resistance,
    so this parameter alone is not enough to isolate the fault. Also, for the proposed
    method, the dimension of the power converter components plays a major influence
    since larger values of inductors cause small ripple content in the current; hence,
    according to what the authors proposed, there was higher internal resistance.
    This aspect was mentioned in the work, but no solution was provided since the
    authors chose a small inductor and stated that the work is rather more focused
    on the evaluation of the membrane resistance than on calculating its accurate
    value. Other works that use the variance of the internal resistance to detect
    faults can be found in [157,158]. A different online approach was studied in [159].
    The authors aimed to develop an easy-to-implement technique for an FC applied
    to transportation applications. The proposed technique is based on a threshold
    that is defined according to the polarization curve for both faulty modes: flooding
    and drying. To define the threshold values, an expression based on the polarization
    curve equation is deduced, and whenever the FC-measured voltage is below the threshold
    value, the fault is detected. To distinguish between flooding and drying, the
    authors needed to apply the current interrupt method, which measures the FC response
    after a sudden high step occurs in the current. Typically, the flooding phenomena
    affect the double layer effect, while drying is more noted in the internal resistance.
    By combining these two approaches the authors were able to identify and isolate
    the fault; however, some remarks must be pointed out. First, the cyclic loads
    can cause variations in the cell voltage that are not related to the faulty state;
    second, the definition of the threshold window is dependent on the estimation
    of how much area is affected by the flooding, and different levels of flooding
    or drying can occur in separate cells inside the stack. The first drawback has
    already been addressed through simulation work. Experimental results were performed
    on a 500 W stack composed of 20 cells with 100 c m 2 each and reported in [68].
    An online signal-based fault diagnosis for both flooding and drying was presented
    in [160]. To achieve that, the technique is based on a signal processing method,
    which is characterized as being empirical, intuitive, direct, and adaptive, without
    the need to pre-determine the basis function, denominated as Empirical Model Decomposition
    (EMD). Moreover, this tool requires low computational power and fewer measurements.
    The application of such a tool to an FC only requires the output voltage and can
    be adapted to every FC since it does not require a predetermined set of functions
    because it calculates those from the original signal. From the original signal,
    a set of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) are calculated. These functions represent
    the contribution of high and low frequencies in which the signal is composed.
    After that, the algorithm extracts the possible number of IMFs and proceeds to
    calculate the contribution of each IMF to the signal. The function obtained is
    denominated as the feature vector. The authors identified that only the first
    and ninth IMF values are necessary to properly distinguish between drying and
    flooding states. The experimental results showed a global diagnosis accuracy of
    98.6%. One of the first works to introduce machine learning in the fault diagnosis
    of FCs was presented in [161]. By using a Bayesian Network (BN), the authors were
    able to identify different faults, including water management faults. The authors
    proclaim that using this type of strategy is advantageous when there are variables
    difficult to estimate or measure. The use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
    to detect flooding has been presented in [101]. This diagnostic method is based
    on comparing the experimental value for cathode pressure drop with model ones,
    creating what is denominated as residuals. For this case, an Elman Neural Network
    (ENN) was used to create the model, and a threshold was defined. The experimental
    tests were performed on a 20-cell stack PEMFC with 500 W nominal output power,
    and the result showed that for flooding operating conditions, the overall temperature
    of the stack decreased significantly, while the dew point temperature presented
    some oscillation. Prior to that, the voltage decreased almost 2 V during the 35
    min experiment, and the cathode pressure also increased. To train the ENN, normal
    operation data were fed to the algorithm, and after some trial and error, the
    threshold residual was chosen. The authors then applied the algorithm to the flooded
    cell. To simulate the flooded mechanism, the hydrogen gas dew point was set to
    a lower value than the cells, forcing condensation to occur uncontrollably. The
    proposed algorithm was able to detect and order an increase in the hydrogen dew
    point temperature to mitigate the fault. The time that it took to detect the fault
    was not reported, but the experimental results showed that during the duration
    of the experiment (almost 45 min), 15 min were reported in flooded mode, and the
    residuals were very different from the threshold limit, therefore showing the
    good applicability of the method. Another NN has been used in [162] to identify
    flooding and drying. This method used a black-box model based on an ENN, which
    simulates and calculates the evolution of both pressure drop and voltage and compares
    it to the real measured value. From that comparison, two residuals are generated
    and evaluated with a threshold, which indicates the occurrence of the fault. The
    main limitation of using the residuals generated by the model is the calculation
    of the threshold value, which typically is empirically based. Nevertheless, both
    simulation and experimental results showed the good accuracy of the proposed technique.
    Similar works can be found in [163,164,165]. Another work using voltage and cathode
    pressure drop residuals is presented in [166]. The authors based their model on
    an ANN that models the evolution of the cathode pressure and the voltage and uses
    their residuals to identify the fault. This technique was only focused on flooding
    conditions and experimented on a single cell with 50 c m 2 of active area. Moreover,
    this work is also relevant for being one of the first to present a recovering
    technique to recuperate from the flooding state. The reconfiguration mechanism
    is based on a self-tuning PID controller that has the function of supplying oxygen
    to the cell. Therefore, whenever a fault is detected, the oxygen intake is increased
    automatically by the PID controller, hence recuperating from the flooding state.
    Even though the method showed good results, applying it to a more elaborated FC
    may have its difficulties since it relies on physical sensors that are typically
    not inserted in a stack, and excess oxygen intake can lead to further complications
    such as an increase in oxidation at the cathode. Flooding is not only associated
    with the cathode but can also occur in the anode, especially if it is caused by
    an excess of back-diffusion phenomena. Most FC manufacturers, for economic and
    practical reasons, choose an exhaustion system based on a regular purge of a solenoid
    valve, which is also referred to as dead-end mode (DEA). This method increases
    the humidity level inside the stack but also causes voltage degradation because
    the water purge is not optimized for each operation point [76]. To improve this
    major drawback, the authors in [76] proposed a purge system that takes into consideration
    the water expelled from the purge system and the time of the purge. Initially,
    an anode water model was deduced; during this stage, the pre-built purge system
    was accessed and noted that it occurred every 10 s for a duration of 10 milliseconds.
    After that, the authors weighted the water being expelled for different current
    values for a time duration of 10 min. With that, and considering the anode as
    a lumped volume, a 0-D model is developed. The results showed good agreement between
    the model and the pre-built purge system, validating the proposed model. Furthermore,
    to improve the purge system a strategy is proposed, where the difference between
    the weight of water expelled and the real one is proposed. No experimental results
    were published, but some concerns must be addressed, such as the behavior under
    dynamic load and the effect on the hydrogen consumption rate. Furthermore, although
    the strategy seems promising, the practical implementation is of concern. Such
    a measure of the weight of the water requires precise sensors, and for every purge,
    the sensor would need to be reset. Another work using an on-line technique through
    data processing is presented in [167]. The authors were able to identify three
    health states: normal state, flooding state, and drying state, using a Support
    Vector Machine (SVM) approach paired with an FC fluidic model. The diagnosis principle
    was based on the data-labeling process and model training off-line, and then it
    was applied on-line. An important aspect of this approach is the training of the
    data, which should be as precise as possible. To ensure that, the authors compared
    the theoretical air mass flow with the real air mass flow and defined a ratio
    that serves as an indicator of the stack’s water management. If the measured ratio
    exceeds the threshold, the cell is in a drying state due to low water content.
    Conversely, if the ratio is lower, it indicates an excess of water molecules blocking
    the airflow passage, resulting in a flooding state. Experimental results performed
    on a 1 kW 20-cell Stack PEMFC were first conducted in the normal state to train
    the algorithm and define the admissible thresholds and showed an overall 90% accuracy.
    Similar work can also be found in [168]. The assumptions typically taken into
    consideration for the model-based approach are very limited for the data available.
    Taking this into account, a different approach is presented in [169]. By developing
    a 3D semi-empirical FC model, the authors were able to consider several electrochemical
    and thermal parameters, as well as the impedance. This 3D model can simulate both
    flooding and drying modes for various operating conditions, such as temperature,
    pressure, and humidity. To identify the fault, an SVM learning algorithm is applied.
    The authors began to identify critical points for a single cell, which are referred
    to as nodes, at the cell center, inlet gas and outlet gas, and boundary zones.
    In total, nine nodes were identified, and their positions on the 3D model represent
    physical phenomena. To model the faults, some resistors were placed within the
    vicinity of the nodes that connect the anode of the previous cell to the cathode
    of the adjacent cell. To understand the difference between drying and flooding,
    the authors identified that the internal relative humidity levels should be between
    60 and 100%; anything higher than the latter values induces flooding conditions,
    while values lower than the former values cause drying conditions. The temperature
    is an important parameter that affects different operating conditions; therefore,
    for example, both activation and concentration losses are reduced when temperature
    is increased. Nonetheless, if the temperature increases higher than a certain
    point, it will negatively affect the performance of the cell, causing cell degradation.
    Another important parameter is the pressure. Regarding the activation losses,
    higher pressures of hydrogen and oxygen are preferred to reduce their effect;
    however, too-high reactant pressure values can cause cell failure, such as flooding.
    For the flooding state, the authors increased the inlet pressure, and to monitor
    the drying state, the relativity humidity levels were kept below the minimum value.
    Furthermore, the results showed that the trainer classifier presented a training
    efficiency of 95.5% and an increase of 3% when applied to unknown data. Fuzzy
    logic has also been applied to faults in FC diagnosis, including water faults,
    [56,170]. In [126], an EIS technique is used as a basic tool, followed by fuzzy
    clustering and fuzzy logic, to develop and mine diagnostic rules from the experimental
    data on-line. The authors proceeded to identify the effect of different operating
    parameters on the expected EIS results, and after the Nyquist plot was obtained,
    the fuzzy clustering algorithm organized the data into different groups with similar
    characteristics. Another fuzzy application in FC diagnosis is presented in [125],
    where it is applied to a commercially available FC. The authors studied the effect
    of air stoichiometry on both oxygen starvation and flooding. Initially, EIS is
    used to measure the response to a voltage stimulus, and after that, a non-model
    based on fuzzy clustering is used for fault diagnosis. When it comes to using
    the EIS technique, there is a crucial factor that must be considered—the impact
    of the purging system. This effect cannot be ignored and must be carefully considered
    to ensure the best possible outcomes. This FC system recurs with a purging mechanism,
    which can induce local fuel starvation for every purging moment [76]. However,
    this effect ended up being neglected, because, for a stack with a high number
    of cells, such as this case, this effect is only noticed in a reduced number of
    cells, particularly those close to the outlet [76,125]. Moreover, once the Nyquist
    plot is obtained for the EIS measurements, a fuzzy-c clustering algorithm clusters
    groups of similar data and compares them to a specific threshold. These data are
    obtained according to certain criteria: the first represents the high-frequency
    intercept of the impedance arc, which represents the internal resistances; the
    second is the polarization resistance, which corresponds to the solely real part
    of the Nyquist plot; the third criterion is the difference between the two previously
    mentioned, and it is represented by the width of the semi-circle measured in the
    real axis; and finally, the fourth criterion is based on the absolute phase value
    of the impedance. The experimental results proved that the first cluster criteria
    were demonstrated to be successfully able to assess the state of health and diagnose
    flooding and drying conditions. 6.2. Data-Based Approaches 6.2.1. Signal-Based
    Techniques A frequently used signal processing tool called Wavelet Packet Transform
    (WPT) has also been used for the diagnosis of flooding and drying in FCs, refs.
    [171,172]. This was first studied in [172], where the voltage signal was analyzed
    by extracting and decomposing it in order to obtain fault identification and fault
    classification. In this case, only the flooding state is tested. This tool allows
    for distinguishing between the flooding state and the normal state for the whole
    state or only for a determined number of cells within the stack. The latter case
    faces greater challenges since the flooding in a defined number of cells does
    not necessarily affect the overall voltage. After applying some mathematical functions
    and properties, a convolution signal is obtained, and for this case, the signal
    can be interpreted continuously, filtering the signal by using low- and high-pass
    filters [172]. From this wavelet packet, two coefficients are derived that represent
    the threshold, which identifies the fault. Experimental tests were conducted on
    a stack composed of 20 cells and with a closed cathode, and the results showed
    a significant difference between the determined coefficients for the normal state
    and flooding state; therefore, the authors concluded that the proposed tool can
    be implemented in different applications. To expand the applicability of the tool,
    a Kalman filter, which uses a set of mathematical equations to estimate the state
    of discrete data, was used to detect flooding [173]. The general signal approach
    for the condition monitoring of fuel cells is illustrated in Figure 13. 6.2.2.
    Statistical Methods Statistical methods are considered one of the data-based approaches,
    as represented in Figure 12. Although not fully explored regarding FC applications,
    this method is very prompt in on-line applications and can easily reduce the cost
    of decision making, improve the prediction of future actions, and most importantly,
    identify problems and faults and make the correct readjustment action [174]. One
    of the first works published on this topic is presented in [174], where the authors
    proposed a statistical approach to estimate the flooding conditions inside the
    stack by elaborating on a reverse fluidic model. The model took into consideration
    several parameters, including the inlet and outlet air mass flow rate, temperature,
    relative humidity, and dimensions of the flow channels and their respective hydraulic
    coefficients. The output of the model is the number of non-flooded parallel channels,
    assuming that in the healthy state, there is no presence of any water droplets,
    and for the flooded state, the fluid flow in the channel is zero. Furthermore,
    the in-between state is represented in the model by the healthy state multiplied
    by a scalar, which represents the non-flooding degree. To validate the feasibility
    of the model, three different experiments under healthy conditions were conducted,
    and the polarization curve was obtained. For the simulation of flooded conditions,
    the hygrometry (moisture content of the intake gases, RH) was increased. Initially,
    the hygrometry was adjusted within the range of 0.7 to nearly 1.1. Values close
    to 0.7 exhibited a minimal degree of flooding, while for values close to 1.1,
    this parameter increased to almost 0.1. Due to the dynamics of the flooding process
    and the responsiveness of the model, the sudden change in RH is not directly registered
    in the flooding degree parameter. Other tests were performed under constant currents
    of 40 and 30 A. From the analysis of the experimental results, the authors concluded
    that higher degrees of flooding represent higher voltage variances, while the
    other parameters remain unchanged; thus, concluding that only cell variances are
    sensitive to flooding occurrence. Figure 13. General scheme of advanced signal-based
    techniques for monitoring Fuel Cell conditions. Another statistical work involving
    statistical analysis has been presented in [175]. The authors analyzed the Electrochemical
    Noise (EN) present in the cell voltage signal in the form of voltage fluctuations.
    After that, several statistical descriptors in the time domain were calculated
    over a small time window, presenting as an on-line technique. The experimental
    results showed that these descriptors (in this case, standard deviation, skewness,
    and flatness) are very sensitive to both drying and flooding conditions. Furthermore,
    this technique was tested for different humidity and current levels. 7. Discussion
    Taking into consideration the number of papers reviewed in the previous section,
    it is more than clear that the focus for PEMFC has been water management issues.
    In fact, according to the data presented in [176], water management faults represent
    52% of the reported cases. Within that percentage, flooding is responsible for
    33%, while drying is responsible for only 19%. Typically, flooding occurs at high
    current densities where the production of water is higher. In this case, the stack
    is operating in the concentration zone of the polarization curve, meaning that
    the number of reaction products is superior to that of the reactants, and there
    is an abrupt decay in both voltage and current. Common symptoms involve significant
    pressure differences between the anode and the cathode, low air mass flow at the
    outlet, sudden voltage decreases, and overall drops in the stack’s performance.
    When operating in dry conditions, the initial voltage drop (activation zone) is
    higher, leading to a more tilted ohmic zone. This occurs because the equivalent
    cell resistance has increased, and the protons have more difficulties crossing
    the protonic membrane. Diagnosing the drying state may include the stack’s temperature,
    increase in internal resistance, membrane’s humidity, and outlet air temperature.
    Surely, mitigating such an occurrence is only possible after a deep, sustained
    knowledge of the system. That is why most diagnostic methods are based on models,
    which rely on the residuals between a physical parameter and a model-estimated
    one, with a focus on an acceptable empirical window where such residuals can oscillate.
    The main limitation lies in the defined threshold, as achieving a fully accurate
    model devoid of any assumptions is quite challenging. Therefore, adopting a 10%
    threshold variation is deemed acceptable. When considering the data-based approach,
    two variables must be taken into consideration. On one hand, there is the computational
    power required, and on the other hand, the targeted time window for the study.
    For this case, wavelet decomposition and FFT have been the main choice preferred
    by the authors in the literature. Furthermore, an important aspect, often overlooked
    in the literature, pertains to the transition from the normal state to the faulty
    state. If external faults are excluded, and the natural aging of the electrodes
    (which heavily depends on the materials used) is neglected, the remaining faults
    can be mitigated through the implementation of appropriate and optimized control.
    As previously mentioned, ensuring proper membrane humidification is paramount,
    alongside the accurate provision of reactants, to extend the stack’s lifespan.
    Fuel cell manufacturers attempt to address this concern by either humidifying
    the reactants prior to their entry into the cell or by inducing instantaneous
    excess water production. However, the latter approach might restrict the stack’s
    application and potentially lead to the formation of hot spots within the membrane.
    In order to enhance the efficiency and reliability of FC systems, three distinct
    strategies can be implemented. The first strategy centers on augmenting material
    durability and reducing costs. This approach seeks to extend the stack’s lifespan
    by alleviating, or at the very least diminishing, the occurrence of permanent
    faults, such as membrane deterioration or FC aging. The second strategy hinges
    on optimizing the control of reactants, fuel, humidity, and average stack temperature.
    This is a pivotal strategy, as it offers the potential to avert transient faults,
    notably flooding and starvation. Moreover, this approach is applicable to existing
    FC systems and can enhance their efficiency. The third approach amalgamates optimized
    control with real-time fault diagnostic algorithms. Its objective is to detect
    faults on-line and subsequently mitigate them by adjusting the control parameters.
    This ultimate stage represents a comprehensive solution for enhancing FC system
    reliability. By operating the stack under optimal conditions and addressing faults
    as they arise, this approach ensures robust performance. Despite progress, challenges
    persist, and the prospect of integrating fault diagnosis and optimized control
    into FC systems promises to bolster their durability, resilience, and overall
    reliability. For a better visualization of the different reviewed works, Table
    2 compiles, in a simple form, the five most important characteristics for correctly
    identifying and avoiding the occurrence of faults in FC systems. Table 2. A compilation
    of the most crucial and essential information on fault occurrence, diagnostic
    methods, and mitigation techniques as applied to Fuel Cell systems. The next generation
    of fuel cells shows immense potential across various applications, including clean
    energy production and transportation (Figure 14). These advancements include increased
    efficiency, enabling better fuel utilization and reduced waste, thereby enhancing
    sustainability. Researchers are also focusing on lowering production costs by
    employing innovative materials and manufacturing techniques, making FCs more economically
    competitive. The exploration of advanced catalysts and proton-conducting membranes
    enhances FC performance and durability. Hydrogen fuel cells are gaining attention
    for applications like vehicles and stationary power generation, with on-going
    efforts to improve hydrogen production, storage, and transportation. FCs are being
    integrated with renewable energy sources, complementing the energy supply, and
    thereby enhancing the reliability of renewable energy systems. Progress in portable
    and micro-FC technology is extending battery life for devices like smartphones
    and laptops, reducing the need for frequent recharging. Additionally, fuel cell
    vehicles emit only water vapor, making them a clean alternative to traditional
    internal combustion engine vehicles, with continuous research improving their
    efficiency and infrastructure. Large-scale FC systems are explored for grid-scale
    energy storage, aiding grid stability and facilitating the integration of renewable
    energy. FCs produce electricity with significantly lower emissions, contributing
    to environmental sustainability, and promoting the transition to a low-carbon
    economy. International collaboration and partnerships are crucial, fostering shared
    knowledge and resources, driving innovation, and overcoming technical and economic
    challenges associated with FC adoption. Figure 14. Diagram of FCs highlighting
    the main challenges in generating reliable FCs and their many applications. Developing
    advanced condition monitoring and fault diagnosis intelligent techniques for the
    next generation of FCs is of paramount importance. These techniques play a crucial
    role in ensuring the reliability, efficiency, and longevity of FC systems. By
    implementing intelligent monitoring systems, researchers and engineers can continuously
    assess the health and performance of FCs in real time, allowing for the early
    detection of potential issues or faults. This proactive approach enables timely
    maintenance and prevents costly breakdowns, ultimately improving the overall operational
    efficiency of fuel cell technologies. Moreover, intelligent fault diagnostic techniques
    facilitate a deeper understanding of the intricate processes within fuel cells,
    leading to continuous improvements in design and performance. These innovations
    not only enhance the safety and reliability of fuel cell applications but also
    accelerate the widespread adoption of this clean and sustainable energy solution,
    contributing significantly to the transition to a more environmentally friendly
    energy landscape. 8. Conclusions This paper aims to analyze the occurrence of
    faults in Fuel Cell systems and how they can be detected. Initially, a generalized
    definition of a fault and its characterization was provided, and a fault-tree
    analogy regarding the different types of fault diagnostic techniques was shown.
    Throughout the paper, meticulous characterization of the faults and their symptoms,
    as well as the different diagnostic approaches, was presented. It can be concluded
    that flooding and drying represent the majority of fault occurrences in a Fuel
    Cell, and their symptoms include significant pressure differences between the
    anode and the cathode, outlet temperature and humidity variation, and an increase
    in membrane resistance. Several diagnostic techniques have been proposed, and
    among them, invasive and off-line techniques such as EIS or current interruption
    are the ones that offer a better understanding of the fault and allow a visual
    interpretation of it. Furthermore, the future trends of fault diagnosis in Fuel
    Cells were also discussed. Author Contributions Conceptualization, P.A., K.L.,

  description: Groundwater resources are vital to ecosystems and livelihoods. Excessive
    groundwater withdrawals can cause groundwater levels to decline 1–10, resulting
    in seawater intrusion 11, land subsidence 12,13, streamflow depletion 14–16 and
    wells running dry 17. However, the global pace and prevalence of local groundwater
    declines are poorly constrained, because in situ groundwater levels have not been
    synthesized at the global scale. Here we analyse in situ groundwater-level trends
    for 170,000 monitoring wells and 1,693 aquifer systems in countries that encompass
    approximately 75% of global groundwater withdrawals 18. We show that rapid groundwater-level
    declines (>0.5 m year−1) are widespread in the twenty-first century, especially
    in dry regions with extensive croplands. Critically, we also show that groundwater-level
    declines have accelerated over the past four decades in 30% of the world’s regional
    aquifers. This widespread acceleration in groundwater-level deepening highlights
    an urgent need for more effective measures to address groundwater depletion. Our
    analysis also reveals specific cases in which depletion trends have reversed following
    policy changes, managed aquifer recharge and surface-water diversions, demonstrating
    the potential for depleted aquifer systems to recover.

    Groundwater resources are vital to ecosystems and livelihoods. Excessive groundwater
    withdrawals can cause groundwater levels to decline1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, resulting
    in seawater intrusion11, land subsidence12,13, streamflow depletion14,15,16 and
    wells running dry17. However, the global pace and prevalence of local groundwater
    declines are poorly constrained, because in situ groundwater levels have not been
    synthesized at the global scale. Here we analyse in situ groundwater-level trends
    for 170,000 monitoring wells and 1,693 aquifer systems in countries that encompass
    approximately 75% of global groundwater withdrawals18. We show that rapid groundwater-level
    declines (>0.5 m year−1) are widespread in the twenty-first century, especially
    in dry regions with extensive croplands. Critically, we also show that groundwater-level
    declines have accelerated over the past four decades in 30% of the world’s regional
    aquifers. This widespread acceleration in groundwater-level deepening highlights
    an urgent need for more effective measures to address groundwater depletion. Our
    analysis also reveals specific cases in which depletion trends have reversed following
    policy changes, managed aquifer recharge and surface-water diversions, demonstrating
    the potential for depleted aquifer systems to recover. Similar content being viewed

    2024 Meta-analysis shows the impacts of ecological restoration on greenhouse gas
    emissions Article Open access 26 March 2024 Main Groundwater is the primary water
    source for many homes, farms, industries and cities around the globe. Unsustainable
    groundwater withdrawals and changes in climate can cause groundwater levels to
    fall1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, making groundwater resources less accessible17. Global
    maps of groundwater storage trends are available7 from the Gravity Recovery and
    Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites, although at a resolution that is too coarse
    (>150,000 km2; ref. 19) to detect local changes and inform local management. Measuring
    multidecadal groundwater-level declines and managing their consequences—including
    seawater intrusion11, land subsidence12,13, streamflow depletion14,15,16 and wells
    running dry17—requires in situ groundwater-level measurements from networks of
    monitoring wells. Such monitoring-well networks have been used at local and regional
    scales to estimate groundwater recharge20,21, characterize streamflow depletion14,
    evaluate the risk of wells running dry17 and test whether surface-water diversions22,23
    or market and policy interventions24 have succeeded in slowing groundwater losses.
    However, in situ groundwater-level observations have rarely been analysed at the
    global scale because we lack a global compilation of in situ groundwater-level
    time series. Here we compile and analyse in situ measurements of groundwater-level
    trends in about 170,000 monitoring wells. The measurements provide new constraints
    on the prevalence of rapid and accelerating groundwater-level declines and their
    correlation with land use and climatic drivers. Furthermore, the measurements
    highlight individual cases in which groundwater levels have recovered following
    policy changes25 and inter-basin water transfers26. Local hotspots of groundwater-level
    changes We compiled and quality-controlled groundwater-level time series in monitoring
    wells from more than 40 countries (see Methods and Supplementary Notes 1 and 2).
    We calculated twenty-first century trends in depth to groundwater level for about
    170,000 monitoring wells with time series that span at least 8 years using Theil–Sen
    robust regression (Fig. 1; analyses based on alternative regression techniques
    and on different quality-control thresholds yield similar results; see Supplementary
    Notes 3, 4, 5 and 6). Positive Theil–Sen slopes indicate deepening groundwater
    levels (red points in Fig. 1). Trends in groundwater levels often differ substantially
    from well to well, and local hotspots of groundwater decline can be found even
    in regions in which nearby groundwater levels are stable or rising, and vice versa
    (Fig. 1), highlighting the importance of analysing groundwater-level trends at
    the scales defined by the boundaries of individual aquifer systems. Fig. 1: Twenty-first
    century groundwater-level trends in globally distributed monitoring wells. Each
    point represents one monitoring well, coloured to represent the Theil–Sen trend

    Data Full size image To evaluate aquifer-scale groundwater-level trends, we manually
    delineated the boundaries of 1,693 aquifer systems—areas underlain by one or more
    aquifers—using maps and descriptions from 1,236 local and regional studies (see
    Methods and Supplementary Note 7). We calculated aquifer-scale groundwater-level
    trends as the median of the Theil–Sen slopes of all monitoring wells located within
    each aquifer system (Fig. 2). Most aquifer-scale groundwater-level trends range
    from −0.1 to 0.9 m year−1 (5th to 95th percentiles), in which negative values
    represent shallowing groundwater levels and positive values indicate deepening
    groundwater levels. Fig. 2: Twenty-first century trends in depth to groundwater
    in 1,693 globally distributed aquifer systems. Each polygon represents one aquifer
    system. Dark grey represents aquifer systems in which groundwater levels have
    been relatively stable (median Theil–Sen slope between −0.1 and 0.1 m year−1).
    Yellow, orange and red represent aquifer systems in which groundwater levels became
    deeper (median Theil–Sen slope >0.1 m year−1). Blue represents aquifer systems
    in which groundwater levels became shallower (median Theil–Sen slope of <−0.1 m year−1).
    Darker colours indicate faster rates. Circular points mark locations for which
    we lack monitoring-well data but groundwater-level trends have been documented
    in the literature, with colours indicating the average of the minimum and maximum
    literature values (Supplementary Note 15). Statistics describing the spatial variability
    of groundwater-level trends within individual aquifers are presented in Supplementary
    Note 23. Median Theil–Sen slopes for all 1,693 aquifer systems are tabulated in
    Supplementary Note 24. Source Data Full size image Groundwater levels became deeper
    over time at rates exceeding 0.1 m year−1 in 36% of the aquifer systems (617 of
    1,693) and exceeding 0.5 m year−1 in 12% (210) of them. Aquifer systems that exhibit
    groundwater-level deepening and are too small to be detected by GRACE satellite
    observations (for example, southeastern Spain) highlight the value of in situ
    groundwater-level measurements to complement global-scale insights5,7,9,19 made
    possible by the GRACE (see Methods and Supplementary Note 8). Groundwater levels
    became shallower over time faster than −0.1 m year−1 in 6% of the aquifer systems
    (97 of 1,693) and faster than −0.5 m year−1 in only 1% (13) of them. Some groundwater-shallowing
    trends may be explained by reductions in groundwater withdrawals, land-cover changes,
    managed aquifer recharge projects (for example, in Arizona’s East Salt River basin22)
    and inter-basin surface-water transfers (for example, the Wanjiazhai water diversion
    to China’s Taiyuan basin26). Accelerating groundwater-level declines To place
    twenty-first century groundwater-level declines into context, we compared them
    with groundwater-level trends during the late twentieth century (1980–2000); this
    analysis was possible in 542 of the 1,693 delineated aquifer systems (see Methods
    and Supplementary Note 9). In 30% of these aquifer systems, groundwater-level
    declines accelerated, with early twenty-first century groundwater-level declines
    outpacing those of the late twentieth century (the red points in Fig. 3a; see
    the red time series in Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 1 for illustrative examples).
    These cases of accelerating groundwater-level declines are more than twice as
    prevalent as one would expect from random fluctuations in the absence of any systematic
    trends in either time period (12.5%; P-value < 0.001 by the binomial test). Furthermore,
    among all cases in which groundwater levels declined in both the late twentieth
    and early twenty-first centuries, declines in the early twenty-first century outpaced
    those in the late twentieth century much more often than one would expect by chance
    (163 red points versus 107 orange points in Fig. 3a; P-value < 0.001 by the sign
    test). If we exclude cases in which groundwater-level trends changed by less than
    0.1 m year−1 between these two periods (that is, considering only points lying
    outside the grey diagonal band in Fig. 3a), we find that accelerating declines
    (red points) outnumber decelerating declines (orange points) by a ratio of 5:2
    (P-value < 0.001 by the sign test). In summary, groundwater-level declines have
    accelerated in a substantial share of the analysed aquifer systems. Fig. 3: Comparison
    of aquifer-scale trends in depth to groundwater during the late twentieth and
    early twenty-first centuries. a, Scatter plot of aquifer-scale trends (median
    Theil–Sen slopes) during 2000–2022 (x-axis values) and during 1980–2000 (y-axis
    values). The colour of each point indicates one of the following categories of
    trends: (1) groundwater levels became shallower during 1980–2000 and continued
    to become shallower (purple points); (2) groundwater levels became shallower during
    1980–2000 but have since become deeper (yellow points); (3) groundwater levels
    became deeper during 1980–2000 but have since become shallower (blue points);
    (4) groundwater levels became deeper during 1980–2000 and continued to become
    deeper but at a slower rate (that is, decelerated deepening; orange points); and
    (5) groundwater levels became deeper during 1980–2000 and continued to become
    deeper at a faster rate (that is, accelerated deepening; red points). The intensity
    of each colour scales with the absolute value (that is, magnitude) of the difference
    between the late twentieth and early twenty-first century trends in groundwater
    level (see legend). b, Examples of groundwater-level time series illustrating
    each of our five categories (see legend). c–i, Maps of aquifer systems categorized
    by their late twentieth and early twenty-first century trends in groundwater levels
    (colours correspond to categories in the legend). For an expanded version of this
    figure, see Supplementary Note 9. Source Data Full size image To test for a potential
    statistical relationship between accelerating groundwater-level declines and climate
    variability, we analysed precipitation rates over the past four decades (Supplementary
    Note 10). We show that most (>80%) of the aquifer systems exhibiting accelerating
    groundwater-level declines also experienced a decline in precipitation over time
    (that is, lower average annual precipitation during the early twenty-first century
    than in the late twentieth century). Declines in precipitation can cause groundwater
    levels to fall as a result of both indirect impacts (for example, increased groundwater
    abstractions during droughts) and direct impacts (for example, reduced recharge
    rates during droughts; see ref. 27). Our finding—that early twenty-first century
    precipitation rates were lower than in the late twentieth century in most aquifer
    systems exhibiting accelerating groundwater-level declines—highlights a potential
    link between decadal-scale climate variability and accelerating groundwater-level
    declines. Accelerating groundwater-level declines, regardless of their potential
    drivers, are likely to also accelerate the consequences of those declines, including
    land subsidence12,13 and wells running dry17. Slowing and reversing groundwater-level
    declines Many previous studies1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 have highlighted groundwater
    losses, but the potential for slowing or reversing these losses has received less
    attention. Our analysis of groundwater levels suggests that long-term groundwater
    losses are neither universal nor inevitable. Specifically, in half (49%) of the
    542 aquifer systems in our analysis, groundwater-level declines have decelerated
    (that is, slowed; orange in Fig. 3; 20%) or reversed (blue in Fig. 3; 16%), or
    groundwater levels have continued to rise (purple in Fig. 3; 13%). In 20% of the
    aquifer systems, groundwater-level deepening has decelerated, as late twentieth
    century groundwater declines continued in the early twenty-first century, but
    at a slower rate (the orange points in Fig. 3a; see orange time series in Fig.
    3b and Extended Data Fig. 2 for illustrative examples). Although these cases are
    outnumbered by those for which groundwater declines have accelerated, they demonstrate
    that it is possible to slow, and potentially even reverse, groundwater-level declines.
    For example, our analysis shows marked deceleration of groundwater-level deepening
    in the Eastern Saq aquifer of Saudi Arabia, possibly owing partly to policies
    designed to reduce agricultural water demands28 (see labelled orange point in
    Fig. 3a, which corresponds to the orange line in Fig. 3b). In 16% of the aquifer
    systems, groundwater level declines reversed—defined as cases in which groundwater
    levels declined in the late twentieth century but rose in the early twenty-first
    century (the blue colours in Fig. 3; see blue time series in Fig. 3b and Extended
    Data Fig. 3 for examples). For example, in the Bangkok basin (Thailand), groundwater
    levels deepened during the late twentieth century but shallowed in the early twenty-first
    century (see labelled blue point in Fig. 3a); this reversal has been attributed25
    to regulatory measures (groundwater pumping fees and licensing of wells). Another
    example is Iran’s Abbas-e Sharghi basin, in which twentieth century groundwater-level
    declines were reversed by the diversion of water to the basin from the Kharkeh
    Dam29. In other areas, groundwater deepening has been reversed following the implementation
    of managed aquifer recharge projects22 (for example, west of Tucson, Arizona;
    Extended Data Fig. 3). Recharge projects are sometimes only viable where excess
    surface waters are available, emphasizing the importance of coordinating groundwater
    and surface-water management30. Nevertheless, these examples illustrate that interventions
    of sufficient scope and scale can reverse declining groundwater trends. In a further
    13% of the aquifer systems, groundwater levels rose in both the late twentieth
    and the early twenty-first centuries (purple colours in Fig. 3; see purple time
    series in Fig. 3b and Extended Data Fig. 4 for examples). Some of these cases
    indicate that aquifers that were heavily exploited before 1980 are recovering.
    Aquifer recovery can potentially ameliorate the consequences of groundwater pumping
    (for example, land subsidence31). In other cases, however, rising groundwater
    levels can be problematic. For example, rising groundwaters can lead to flooding
    of coastal cities32, waterlogging of farmlands33 and salinization of groundwaters
    and soils34. Rising groundwater levels may be driven by reductions in groundwater
    withdrawals25 or increases in recharge rates owing to land clearing35,36, irrigation33
    or managed aquifer recharge37. Our aquifer-scale groundwater-level trends can
    help predict where rising groundwater levels may pose challenges. Although these
    examples illustrate that groundwater declines can be slowed or reversed, several
    caveats must be kept in mind. In general, rates of groundwater-level shallowing
    are much slower than rates of groundwater-level decline. Of the aquifer systems
    in Fig. 3 with rising twenty-first century groundwater levels (blue and purple
    points), only 6% are rising faster than −0.2 m year−1. By contrast, of the aquifer
    systems with deepening twenty-first century groundwater levels (yellow, red and
    orange points in Fig. 3), 25% are falling faster than 0.2 m year−1. Furthermore,
    across these aquifer systems, the average rate of twenty-first century deepening
    (0.2 m year−1) exceeds the average rate of shallowing (−0.05 m year−1) by a factor
    of four. Thus, rapidly rising groundwater levels are rare, but they demonstrate
    that aquifer recovery is possible, especially following policy changes25, managed
    aquifer recharge37 and inter-basin surface water-transfers26. Groundwater declines
    in cultivated drylands Many of the aquifer systems with declining twenty-first
    century groundwater levels (Fig. 2) underlie drylands, defined38 as areas in which
    average precipitation divided by potential evapotranspiration is less than 0.65.
    Rapidly deepening groundwater levels (faster than 0.5 m year−1) are found in 11%,
    24% and 8% of aquifers in climate zones classified38 as hyper-arid, arid and semi-arid,
    respectively. Notably, aquifer systems with rapidly deepening groundwater levels
    are virtually absent (<1%) in humid and dry subhumid climate zones. Our 1,693
    aquifer-scale groundwater-level trends exhibit a moderately strong rank correlation
    with precipitation divided by potential evapotranspiration39 (Spearman ρ = −0.40,
    P-value < 0.001; Supplementary Note 11 and Methods), implying that groundwater
    deepening is more common in drier climates (Fig. 4). As well as rapid groundwater-level
    declines, we also find that accelerating groundwater-level declines are more common
    in drier climates, especially underlying cultivated lands (Supplementary Note
    9), probably reflecting greater reliance on groundwater for irrigation. Fig. 4:
    Twenty-first century aquifer-scale trends in depth to groundwater in the context
    of climate and cultivation. a, The percentage of aquifer systems with rapidly
    deepening groundwater (median Theil–Sen slope steeper than 0.5 m year−1) when
    categorized by climate conditions and cropland prevalence. Aquifer systems with
    rapidly deepening groundwater are most common in hyper-arid, arid and semi-arid
    climate zones (see categories on the x axis) and where a larger proportion of
    land is under cultivation (see categories on the y axis). b, Scatter plot of aquifer-scale
    average annual precipitation divided by potential evapotranspiration39, and the
    percentage of land area under cultivation40 (estimated for the year 2015). The
    colour of each point represents the twenty-first century aquifer-scale groundwater-level
    trend (median Theil–Sen slope). Blue and red points indicate shallowing and deepening,
    respectively, of groundwater, with darker colours indicating faster rates. Background
    shades represent climate zones classified by annual precipitation divided by potential
    evapotranspiration (that is, x-axis values). Several aquifer systems are absent
    from this plot because either no land is under cultivation (incompatible with
    the log scale of the y axis) or precipitation divided by evapotranspiration values
    fall outside the shown range of x-axis values. For alternative versions of this
    figure showing these aquifer systems, see Supplementary Note 11. Source Data Full
    size image Irrigation is estimated to account for 70% of global groundwater withdrawals18.
    A lack of high-resolution, ground-truthed data quantifying groundwater withdrawals
    for irrigation precludes statistical tests of their correlation with groundwater-level
    changes over time. However, using high-resolution global land cover data40, we
    can test for statistical relationships between land-use patterns and groundwater
    trends (Fig. 4). Aquifer systems with rapidly deepening groundwater levels (>0.5 m year−1)
    are relatively common (17%) where more than one-fifth of the land surface is cultivated,
    but are virtually absent (0.8%) where cultivation accounts for <1% of the land
    surface. Across the 1,693 aquifer systems, rates of groundwater-level deepening
    are significantly correlated with the proportion of land under cultivation40 (Spearman
    ρ = 0.17, P-value < 0.001; Fig. 4). This statistical relationship becomes stronger
    when we account for the correlation between cultivation and climatic aridity (partial
    rank correlation coefficient = 0.32, P-value < 0.001; see Supplementary Note 11).
    Our analyses demonstrate that rapid groundwater declines are most common in cultivated
    drylands. Groundwater losses from dryland aquifers pose management challenges.
    Aquifer recharge is typically slow in drylands41, meaning that depleted dryland
    aquifers will generally take longer to recover than aquifers in wetter climates42,
    except where recharge rates are artificially increased (for example, seepage from
    unlined canals in the Indus basin33). Moreover, groundwater is often the sole
    source of perennial drinking water for communities in drylands. As groundwater
    levels become deeper, shallower wells can run dry17, compromising local water
    access. Even where groundwater levels remain stable, groundwater withdrawals can
    deplete the flow of nearby streams by reducing natural seepage of groundwater
    to rivers, or even inducing streamwater leakage into underlying aquifers (see
    discussion of ‘capture’ by ref. 43). Indeed, leakage from surface waters may replenish
    pumped aquifers and stabilize groundwater levels at the expense of streamflow.
    The prevalence of rapid and accelerating groundwater declines in cultivated drylands
    suggests that, even if management strategies are in place, they have often been
    insufficient—either in concept or in implementation—to slow or reverse groundwater
    depletion. Depleting and recovering groundwater resources Our analysis of groundwater-level
    measurements demonstrates that: (1) groundwater levels are declining rapidly (>0.5 m year−1)
    in many regions (Fig. 2); (2) groundwater declines are accelerating in many aquifer
    systems around the world (Fig. 3); and (3) both rapid and accelerating groundwater
    declines are particularly evident in aquifers underlying cultivated drylands (Fig.
    4 and Supplementary Notes 9 and 11). Our analysis also identifies cases in which
    late twentieth century groundwater declines have been reversed in the early twenty-first
    century (blue points in Fig. 3). However, cases of rapidly rising groundwater
    levels remain outnumbered by cases of rapidly deepening groundwater levels. Our
    results indicate that twenty-first century realities—including climatic trends,
    hydrogeologic conditions, groundwater withdrawal rates, land uses and management
    approaches—have resulted in widespread, rapid and accelerating groundwater-level
    declines. Nevertheless, the compiled in situ observations also capture numerous
    cases in which declines in groundwater levels have slowed, stopped or reversed
    following intervention (for example, implementation of regulatory measures25).
    Although our work represents the most extensive analysis of groundwater-level
    monitoring records so far, it does not cover the globe (see Methods section entitled
    ‘Limitations’). Further, analysed monitoring wells do not represent a randomized
    sample of global wells and we are only able to analyse groundwater level trends
    where monitoring data are available. Global maps of groundwater storage changes
    from GRACE satellite observations7 suggest that groundwater stores are declining
    in some regions in which monitoring data are not publicly available and, thus,
    cannot be evaluated here. GRACE data are also important for characterizing impacts
    of climate change and variability9,19,44,45,46 and evaluating global hydrologic
    models47. Evaluating such models is important because they are widely used to
    estimate groundwater depletion (see ref. 6 and Table 3 in ref. 48). Our compilation
    of monitoring-well data could facilitate future efforts to reconcile GRACE-based,
    model-based and piezometric-based groundwater time series (see refs. 49,50). Combining
    these diverse data products—and thus exploiting both the high spatial resolution
    of monitoring-well networks and the global coverage of GRACE7,9,19 and hydrologic
    models2,3,6,16,48—may yield new insights into the causes, consequences and spatial
    patterns of groundwater depletion. Groundwater depletion can threaten ecosystems
    and economies. Specifically, groundwater depletion can damage infrastructure through
    land subsidence12,13, impair fluvial ecosystems through streamflow depletion14,15,16,
    jeopardize agricultural productivity51 and compromise water supplies as wells
    run dry17. Our methodologically consistent analysis of groundwater-level trends
    across 1,693 globally distributed aquifer systems demonstrates widespread, rapid
    and accelerating twenty-first century groundwater-level declines, particularly
    in cultivated drylands. Our analysis also documents cases for which groundwater
    declines have slowed or reversed after: (1) the implementation of groundwater
    policies; (2) the alleviation of groundwater demand by means of surface-water
    transfers; or (3) the addition of groundwater storage following managed aquifer
    recharge projects. To address the growing problem of global groundwater depletion,
    these kinds of success stories would need to be replicated in dozens of aquifer
    systems with declining groundwater levels. Thus, our analysis illustrates the
    potential for depleted aquifers to recover, while demonstrating how much work
    remains to be done to protect groundwater resources. By documenting global hotspots
    of groundwater-level decline and recovery, this analysis can inform efforts to
    address rapid and accelerating groundwater depletion. Methods Delineating global

,1250,1251,1252,1253,1254,1255,1256,1257,1258,1259,1260,1261,1262,1263,1264,1265,1266,1267,1268,1269,1270,1271,1272,1273,1274,1275,1276,1277,1278,1279,1280,1281,1282,1283,1284,1285,1286,1287,1288
    (Supplementary Note 7) to delineate 1,693 study areas, each underlain by one or
    more aquifers and/or low-permeability geologic formations that are, collectively,
    referred to as an ‘aquifer system’. Each aquifer system was delineated by consulting
    maps and reading descriptions within local-scale reports. Specific steps applied
    to delineate the boundaries of each aquifer system are detailed in Supplementary
    Note 7. Downloading groundwater-level data Our study focuses on more than 40 countries
    for which we compiled monitoring-well data. We analysed groundwater-level time
    series derived from numerous data repositories (dataset-specific details are available
    in Supplementary Note 1; some of these datasets are described in refs. 1289,1290,1291,1292,1293,1294,1295,1296,1297).
    The compiled groundwater-level databases span different time intervals and have
    different measurement frequencies (see heat map plot and global maps showing monitoring-well
    time series durations and measurement frequencies in Supplementary Note 12). Quality
    controlling groundwater-level time series We completed five pre-processing steps
    before analysing groundwater-level data. First, we identified replicate groundwater-level
    measurements, defined as cases in which an identical measurement date and an identical
    groundwater-level measurement were reported from the same monitoring well; in
    these cases, we retain only one of these replicates. Second, we identified cases
    in which several groundwater-level measurements from the same monitoring well
    reported identical measurement dates. In these cases, we calculated the median
    among all groundwater-level measurements sharing the same measurement date and
    the adjacent points in the time series (that is, the median of the group of measurements
    with identical dates and the measurements immediately preceding and following
    the same-date measurements); we then kept only the single water-level measurement
    whose value was closest to this calculated median (Supplementary Note 2). Third,
    we excluded extreme values of depth to groundwater (that is, >1,000 m and <−1,000 m)
    and implausibly high groundwater elevations (that is, >8,000 m above sea level).
    Fourth, we excluded groundwater-level measurements with values of ‘999’, ‘−9,999’
    or ‘0’, because some databases used these values as a code for missing measurements
    (see figures in Supplementary Note 2). Fifth, we excluded outlier values detected
    by a machine-learning algorithm1298 (based on an additive regression model1299;
    for details, see Supplementary Note 2.1). This algorithm was applied to each monitoring
    well with more than 15 groundwater-level measurements, yielding a prediction for
    each time step and its 99% confidence interval. We defined points to be outliers
    and excluded them if they fell outside the range defined by the predicted groundwater
    level ±0.75 times this confidence interval. If a large number of measurements
    within a monitoring well’s time series were classified as outliers, we excluded
    the entire time series from our analysis (in which a ‘large number of measurements’
    is defined as cases for which there were at least five outliers identified by
    the machine-learning algorithm and for which these outliers comprise >1% of all
    measurements in the time series; for visualization, see schematics in Supplementary
    Note 2). Among the approximately 170,000 monitoring wells presented in Fig. 1,
    only about 12% had one or more outlier points removed by means of this machine-learning
    approach, highlighting that this machine-learning approach affected only a small
    proportion of consulted monitoring wells. Furthermore, a comparison of aquifer-scale
    trends in depth to groundwater with versus without the use of a machine-learning-based
    outlier-exclusion procedure suggests that our machine-learning approach had no
    substantial influence on our findings (see Supplementary Note 13). Flagging groundwater-level
    measurements based on rapid increases or decreases After excluding potential outliers
    (through the steps outlined in the previous paragraph), we calculated each monitoring
    well’s annual median groundwater levels for each calendar year with at least one
    measurement. We then visually inspected plots of annual median groundwater levels
    over time. On visual inspection, we noted that a small number of monitoring wells
    show ‘spikes’ in their annual groundwater-level time series, in which a ‘spike’
    is defined as a high-magnitude (absolute value > 20 m year−1) groundwater-level
    change followed directly by another high-magnitude groundwater-level change in
    the opposite direction (for example, a high-magnitude groundwater-level deepening
    trend between two adjacent points in the time series, directly followed by a high-magnitude
    groundwater-level shallowing trend between two adjacent points). We flagged these
    data points as potentially suspect. The first or last point in each time series
    was also flagged if it differed by more than 20 m year−1 from the second or next-to-last
    point. We compared groundwater-level trends with and without these flagged points
    and observed only trivial differences (Supplementary Note 5: ‘Similar aquifer-scale
    trends obtained with and without flagged measurements’). The results presented
    in the main text (for example, Fig. 1) derive from annual median groundwater-level
    time series that exclude the flagged measurements. Statistical analyses of twenty-first
    century groundwater-level trends (Figs. 1 and 2) To evaluate groundwater-level
    trends since the year 2000, we excluded all previous measurements. Next, we excluded
    all monitoring wells for which the earliest and most recent annual medians were
    separated by fewer than 8 years. We calculated trends in annual median groundwater
    levels for all monitoring wells that met these minimum criteria for analysis (for
    a similar method, see ref. 1288). Some data sources report groundwater levels
    as elevations (metres above sea level) and others report them as depth to groundwater
    (metres below the land surface, or below the top of the well). In cases in which
    both were reported, we used the depth to groundwater data. If groundwater levels
    were only reported as elevations, we reversed the signs of the calculated trends,
    to obtain trends in depth to groundwater. Our results in the main text are based
    on Theil–Sen regression slopes1300,1301 but we also applied several different
    regression techniques, including ordinary least squares, iteratively reweighted
    least squares1302,1303,1304 and RANSAC (or random sample consensus)1305, which
    yielded comparable results (Supplementary Note 3; for non-parametric regression
    techniques, see Supplementary Note 4 and ref. 1306). We present our results as
    trends in depth to groundwater, meaning that positive slopes represent groundwater
    levels becoming deeper over time. We calculated an aquifer-scale groundwater-level
    trend for each aquifer system by taking the median of the Theil–Sen slopes of
    all monitoring wells within its boundaries (Fig. 2). Comparing groundwater-level
    trends between the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries (Fig. 3) To
    contextualize twenty-first century trends in depth to groundwater, we identified
    monitoring wells with sufficient data during two periods: the late twentieth century
    (1980–2000) and the early twenty-first century (2000–2022). Here well time series
    are ‘sufficient’ if their earliest and latest annual medians are separated by
    at least 8 years within a given time interval (that is, 1980–2000 or 2000–2022).
    There are 45,911 monitoring wells in the compiled dataset with sufficient groundwater-level
    data for trend analyses during both periods. For these monitoring wells, we calculated
    Theil–Sen trends in depth to groundwater for the late twentieth century. Next,
    we grouped monitoring wells located within the same aquifer system and calculated
    aquifer-scale trends for the late twentieth century (medians of the Theil–Sen
    slopes for all wells in each system; that is, y-axis values presented in Fig.
    3a). Only aquifer systems with at least five monitoring wells for both time periods
    (1980–2000 and 2000–2022) satisfying the aforementioned requirements were used
    to compare late twentieth century and early twenty-first century trends in depth
    to groundwater. Last, we assigned each aquifer system to one of five categories
    based on its late twentieth century and early twenty-first century trends in depth
    to groundwater: (1) groundwater levels became shallower during 1980–2000 and continued
    to become shallower (purple points in Fig. 3a); (2) groundwater levels became
    shallower during 1980–2000 but have since become deeper (yellow points in Fig.
    3a); (3) groundwater levels became deeper during 1980–2000 but have since become
    shallower (blue points in Fig. 3a); (4) groundwater levels became deeper during
    1980–2000 and continued to become deeper but at a slower rate (that is, decelerated
    deepening; orange circles in Fig. 3a); and (5) groundwater levels became deeper
    during 1980–2000 and continued to become deeper at a faster rate (that is, accelerated
    deepening; red circles in Fig. 3a). Further details are available in Supplementary
    Note 9. Geospatial analysis of potential explanatory variables (Fig. 4) To test
    for statistical relationships between the spatial distributions of environmental
    conditions and groundwater-level trends, we downloaded two geospatial datasets:
    (1) long-term mean annual precipitation divided by potential evapotranspiration
    (the ‘CGIAR-CSI Global-Aridity and Global-PET Database’; ref. 39) and (2) the
    proportion of land area under cultivation (estimated for the year 2015; ref. 40).
    Next, we averaged each of these geospatial datasets over each of the 1,693 aquifer
    systems (Fig. 4). We calculated rank correlations between twenty-first century
    aquifer-scale groundwater-level trends and both of the potential explanatory variables
    (namely, (1) long-term mean annual precipitation divided by potential evapotranspiration
    and (2) the proportion of land area under cultivation). We also used multiple
    regression on the rank transforms of these explanatory variables to account for
    their covariation (Supplementary Note 11). Limitations Our analyses are based
    on the best available measurements but nonetheless have limitations. Here we detail
    some of these limitations and evaluate how some may affect our main conclusions.
    Although we have used several steps, as outlined above, to detect and remove outliers,
    we cannot independently verify the accuracy of all groundwater-level time series.
    Nevertheless, our analysis is based on several layers of robust estimation (for
    example, Theil–Sen regression on annual medians), minimizing its sensitivity to
    unreliable data. Groundwater-level data from individual monitoring wells span
    different time intervals and have different measurement frequencies, as detailed
    in Supplementary Note 12. Furthermore, about 41% of the analysed monitoring wells
    have discontinuous time series of annual groundwater levels (for which ‘discontinuous’
    time series are defined as those lacking a groundwater-level measurement for at
    least one of the calendar years that lie between the earliest and most recent
    twenty-first century groundwater-level measurements; for an example of a discontinuity
    in an annual groundwater-level time series, see Supplementary Fig. 3c). We could
    not obtain groundwater-level data for many countries around the globe and our
    conclusions are only directly applicable where we have data. GRACE satellite data1307,1308,1309,1310,1311
    suggest that groundwater storage has declined in some of the areas in which we
    lack monitoring-well data (Supplementary Note 8). Further, simulation results
    from a global model suggest that substantial groundwater depletion may have occurred
    in some of the countries in which we lack monitoring-well data, so groundwater-level
    deepening may be even more widespread than our results indicate (refs. 16,1312;
    Supplementary Note 14). We reviewed published and grey literature20,427,802,1282,1313,1314,1315,1316,1317,1318,1319,1320,1321,1322,1323,1324,1325,1326,1327,1328,1329,1330,1331,1332,1333,1334,1335,1336,1337,1338,1339,1340,1341,1342,1343,1344,1345,1346,1347,1348,1349,1350,1351,1352,1353,1354,1355,1356
    to obtain groundwater-level trends for some of the countries in which we lack
    monitoring-well data (that is, point data in Fig. 2; details available in Supplementary
    Note 15). We highlight that monitoring wells are not distributed evenly across
    each aquifer system. Consequently, some locations within aquifer systems are not
    captured by compiled monitoring-well data (see discussion of Dhaka (Bangladesh)
    in Supplementary Note 15). The aquifer-scale trends that we present in the main
    text (Figs. 2–4) do not provide insights into the spatial patterns of groundwater-level
    trends within individual aquifer systems. The high variability in monitoring-well
    densities within aquifer systems, as well as the substantial variability in groundwater-level
    trends even among co-located monitoring wells, are presented in a suite of maps
    for individual aquifer systems in Supplementary Notes 16 and 17. Specifically,
    our analysis demonstrates that groundwater-level trends can vary greatly among
    wells within individual aquifer systems (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Notes 16 and
    17), implying that local-scale groundwater-level declines may be even more widespread
    than our Fig. 2 suggests (Supplementary Note 18). Some of the variability in groundwater-level
    trends among co-located wells may be partly explained by differences in the depths
    of nearby monitoring wells, as shallow and deep aquifers can have different groundwater-level
    trends (see Supplementary Note 19). We stress that groundwater-level trends may
    differ between deeper and shallower wells (for example, ref. 1357) owing to, for
    example, differences in the depths of nearby wells used to extract groundwater
    and differences in storage coefficients between unconfined and confined aquifers
    (see, for example, refs. 1358,1359). Steep groundwater-level trends—both upward
    and downward—are more common in deeper wells than in shallower wells, possibly
    due in part to the greater prevalence of confined conditions at deeper depths
    (discussion and analyses available in Supplementary Note 19). 2D geologic data
    are available at the global scale1360, but an accurate high-resolution 3D hydrogeologic
    dataset remains unavailable for the globe, meaning that key hydrogeologic conditions
    (for example, whether the monitoring well captures unconfined versus confined
    conditions) cannot be ascribed for deep versus shallow wells at the global scale.
    We highlight that our approach to delineating boundaries for individual aquifer
    systems—although based on local-scale studies—potentially introduces inconsistencies,
    because local norms for delineating aquifer-system boundaries may differ. Further,
    some (16%) of the 170,000 monitoring wells fall outside the boundaries of the
    aquifer systems delineated here and, therefore, are excluded from our aquifer-scale
    statistical analyses. We present groundwater-level trends for monitoring wells
    both within and outside aquifer-system boundaries in a series of regional-scale
    maps (Supplementary Note 16). It is possible that some of monitoring-well-based
    time series may be truncated where the monitoring well itself has run dry (see
    ref. 1361), possibly excluding monitoring wells located in areas experiencing
    rapid groundwater depletion. We analysed monitoring-well depths and depth to groundwater
    data for 72,000 wells and conclude that it is possible that a small proportion
    of the groundwater-level time series was truncated owing to well desiccation (see
    Supplementary Note 20). Thus, rapid and accelerating twenty-first century groundwater-level
    deepening may be even more prevalent than our analysis indicates. Our main-text
    results are based on annual median groundwater levels. However, we acknowledge
    that trends in depth to groundwater can differ when based on measurements made
    during specific seasons (for example, long-term trends in pre-monsoon depth to
    groundwater can differ from long-term trends in post-monsoon depth to groundwater;
    see ref. 1362). We highlight that trends in season-specific groundwater levels
    may differ from trends in annual median groundwater levels (as presented in Fig.
    1), especially where intra-annual groundwater-level variability is changing over
    time (for example, time series from the Bengal basin in Supplementary Note 21;
    see also the time series presented in refs. 21,1363,1364). The compiled groundwater-level
    time series do not allow us to infer trends over longer (for example, centennial-scale)
    time intervals. In some areas, substantial groundwater-level changes took place
    long before the four decades that we focus on here. For example, there is evidence1365,1366
    that substantial accumulation occurred during the twentieth century in parts of
    South Asia and that groundwater levels were much deeper at the start of the twentieth
    century than they are today (see, specifically, Fig. 3b in ref. 1365). Some aquifer
    systems in our dataset, for example, may have been heavily depleted during the
    mid-twentieth century, but have exhibited relatively stable groundwater levels
    (or even shallowing groundwater-level trends) during the twenty-first century.
    Given the potential for such cases, we make no claim that stable twenty-first
    century groundwater levels necessarily imply a lack of previous or continuing
    disturbance. We do not make claims about aquifer-specific drivers behind rapid
    and accelerating groundwater declines (although we do make note of case studies
    in the literature that have identified important drivers; for example, ref. 25).
    We acknowledge that groundwater abstractions can perturb flow systems and, in
    many cases, deplete aquifers. Many of the aquifer systems exhibiting rapid groundwater-level
    declines are being accessed by wells, as evidenced by recorded well-completion
    events throughout the early twenty-first century (Supplementary Note 22; data
    described in refs. 17,1367,1368,1369) and by regional-scale research108,1370,1371.
    Further, we acknowledge that climate variability and change can have both direct
    impacts on groundwater levels (such as through changes in groundwater recharge
    owing to, for example, changes in temporal variability in precipitation) and also
    indirect impacts on groundwater levels (for example, through changes in groundwater
    demand in response to climate variability, such as increased groundwater withdrawals
    during drier time intervals; see ref. 27). Available precipitation data1372,1373
    suggest that most of the aquifer systems characterized as exhibiting accelerating
    groundwater-level declines (that is, red points in Fig. 3) are situated in areas
    in which early twenty-first century annual precipitation rates were lower than
    late twentieth century annual precipitation rates (Supplementary Note 10), highlighting
    that, at a minimum, we cannot rule out an influence of climate variability (direct
    or indirect) on groundwater-level changes over time. Data availability Annual

  description: Best management practices (BMPs) have been extensively employed in
    effective watershed management for non-point source pollution. The weights of
    objective functions and the restrictive conditions of combined BMPs are the vital
    requirements for BMPs allocation. Therefore, it is more beneficial to explore
    that a spatial optimal allocation method considering multi-attribute decision
    making and multiple BMPs random combination. Here is the novel framework based
    on Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic
    Algorithm II (NSGA-Ⅱ), which considers multiple objectives in deriving watershed-scale
    pollution control practices by considering BMPs cost and combined reduction rates
    of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP). The framework also integrates
    combined Entropy Weight method (EWM) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity
    to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to solve the weights of TN and TP, and considers the
    attributes of the sub-basin itself, which is more local suitability. Four categories
    of BMPs, tillage management, nutrient management, vegetative filter strips, and
    landscape management, were evaluated in the Jing River Basin (JRB) and resulted
    in reduction rates of 9.77%, 10.53%, 16.40%, and 14.27% averagely, respectively.
    BMP allocation schemes, derived from multi-objective optimization, are stratified
    into three financial scenarios. Low-cost scenario, costing up to 2 billion RMB,
    primarily targets the grain for green program in 28.81% of sub-basins. Medium-cost
    scenario, between 2 and 6 billion RMB, predominantly utilizes the grain for green
    in areas with a slope greater than 15°, accounting for 20.00% of sub-basins. High-cost
    scenario exceeds 6 billion RMB, mainly due to the implementation of multiple combination
    measures. The three configuration scenarios can provide decision-makers with a
    trade-off between measure costs and reduction efficiency. Overall, the innovative
    framework not only facilitates cost-effective implementation but provides a beneficial
    methodology for selecting cost-effective conservation practices in other regions.

    managementThe Pareto-optimal front 1. Introduction Non-point source pollution
    is a widespread and unpredictable environmental issue that has become the environmental
    issues around the world. Attention has turned towards its simulation and the analysis
    of best management practices (BMPs), which have become the focus of the problem
    of water environment pollution and difficulties (Geng et al., 2013; Liu and Xu,
    2011; Zhang et al., 2013). BMPs have a beneficial effect on natural processes
    such as ecohydrology, soil erosion (Lynch et al., 1985), and nutrient cycling
    in the watershed scale, preventing and controlling pollutants at the three hydrologic
    cycles of pollutant sources, transport and transformation processes, and entry
    into the stream channel (Meng et al., 2013; Zhang and Zhang, 2011). However, it
    should be noted that successful watershed management development frequently faces
    obstacles such as costs associated with implementing varied BMPs. Once these constraints
    are resolved, both cost-effectiveness and pollutant reduction of BMP placement
    can be significantly improved. Optimization algorithms can aid in prioritizing
    selection of BMPs conveniently and effectively, such as genetic algorithms (Geng
    et al., 2019). BMPs spatial optimal allocation is a complex nonlinear problem
    that requires consideration of multiple factors such as reduction of land surface
    pollution, variations in crop yields, and implementation costs. Given that these
    factors often contradict each other, it becomes imperative to adopt a multi-objective
    optimization approach. Currently, prevalent multi-objective optimization algorithms
    include VEGA, MOGA, SPEA, NSGA, NSGA-II, and NSGA-III (Deb et al., 2002; Deb and
    Jain, 2014; Jain and Deb, 2014). Spatial optimization strategies for management
    measures that enhance existing optimization algorithms are spearheading research
    into spatial allocation options for water management (Nicklow et al., 2010; Shafiee
    and Berglund, 2011). The spatial optimization combinations of BMPs can be implemented
    at the watershed scale, where BMPs correspond to the number of sub-watersheds
    (Naseri et al., 2021), or hydrologic response units scale (Maringanti et al.,
    2009; Naseri et al., 2021; Panagopoulos et al., 2011). The Non-dominated Sorting
    Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) has gained prominence as a widely adopted multi-objective
    genetic algorithm to guide the appropriate placement of BMPs, based on efficiency
    and economic considerations (Chen et al., 2015; Pyo et al., 2017). Implementation
    of watershed BMPs necessitates reasonable simulation and evaluation, typically
    involving watershed models. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) has been
    instrumental in evaluating surface source pollution (Chen et al., 2022; Gao, 2020),
    agricultural control management (Pokhrel and Paudel, 2019), tillage and management
    measure (Zhang et al., 2018), and other surface source pollution control management
    measures optimization with better applicability (Lu et al., 2019). It has been
    demonstrated that incorporating the distributed watershed model SWAT within an
    optimization framework can facilitate optimal solutions (Naseri et al., 2021).
    For instance, a successful coupling of SWAT and NSGA-II in the BMPs optimization
    model was applied in the Beijing watershed, China (Geng et al., 2019). The coupled
    approach, proven beneficial in the spatial optimization of BMPs, provides decision-makers
    with cost-effective options and enhances conservation measure efficacy (Naseri
    et al., 2021). Nonetheless, employing NSGA-II for accurate BMPs configuration
    and optimization poses several challenges: (ⅰ) potential solutions could be overlooked
    due to the neglect of optimal placement of agricultural BMPs and trade-offs between
    multiple objectives, bringing uncertainties in the search for the best optimization
    (Yang and Best, 2015), and (ⅱ) The varying efficiencies of different preventative
    and control measures in reducing pollutant loads compound the complexity of integrating
    and optimizing individual measures for multi-objective optimization, thereby presenting
    practical challenges for the usage of Best Management Practice (Panagopoulos et
    al., 2014). In this study, a multi-objective optimization algorithm was employed,
    incorporating NSGA-II and SWAT, for the spatial configuration of BMPs in the Jing
    River Basin (JRB). The study simultaneously addresses the combined reduction rate
    and multi-objective functions under multiple constraints. The primary study objectives
    are: (ⅰ) to develop a novel method for solving combined reduction rates of TN
    and TP, which was integrated for resolving multi-objective functions and BMP constraints,
    and (ⅱ) to construct a cohesive optimization framework, merging SWAT and NSGA-II,
    that presents an effective solution while adhering to economic and cost constraints
    through stochastic combination of measures. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study
    area and data The Jing River (JR), a secondary tributary of the Yellow River (Fig.
    1b), is the largest primary tributary of the Wei River, that originates from the
    eastern foothill of Liupan Mountain in Jingyuan County, Ningxia Autonomous Region
    (Fig. 1c). The river traverses three provinces, Ningxia, Gansu and Shaanxi, and
    finally converges into Wei River in Shaanxi Province (Chen et al., 2008), forming
    the JRB with a basin area of 45,421 km2. Located in the central area of Loess
    Plateau, between latitudes 106°14′-108°42′N and longitudes 34°46′-37°19′E, the
    basin exhibits a fragile ecological environment and severe soil erosion. The region
    is dominated by calcaric cambisols (70.9%), primarily composed of chalky sands,
    with 43% chalk particles, 36% sand particles and 21% clay (Ruan et al.). Nestled
    between arid and semi-arid to semi-humid zones (Wu et al., 2019), and multi-year
    average sediment concentration of Zhangjiazhan station is 148 kg/m3. Furthermore,
    the land use in the region is predominantly comprised of cultivated land (45.26%),
    grassland (41.77%), and forest land (10.33%). Notably, the water pollution level
    in the Jingcun section was severe before 2018, with class IV water accounting
    for 42.9% and class V water for 57.1% during 2011–2017 (Zhang, 2021b). Agricultural
    pesticides, fertilizers, livestock, and other non-point source pollution have
    been identified as the main causes for exceeding the standard measures (Wu et
    al., 2013). Thus, employing a suitable multi-objective optimization algorithm
    to determine the optimal placement of BMPs in the JRB is of utmost significance.

    2.2. SWAT evaluation and BMPs description 2.2.1. Model set up and evaluation The
    Soil Water and Assessment Tool (SWAT) model is a continuous-time watershed scale
    model (Arnold et al., 1998, 2012; Gassman et al., 2007). Through hydrological
    process estimations, pollutant transport equations, and various other hydrological
    processes, accurate assessments can be performed. It proves especially useful
    in water quality evaluations and the application of BMPs (Himanshu et al., 2019;
    Uniyal et al., 2020; Venishetty and Parajuli, 2022). The construction of the SWAT
    model encompasses watershed delineation, hydrologic response unit delineation,
    input of meteorological data, generation of a SWAT database, and the calibration
    and validation of the model. SWAT 2012 delineated the watershed according to DEM,
    utilizing a warm-up period of 5 years (1995–2000), subsequently divided into sub-basins
    and hydrologic response units based on homogeneity in land use, soil, and slope.
    In this study, the JRB was separated into 59 sub-basins and 1508 hydrologic response
    units, adopting a hydrologic response unit threshold of 5% for land use and soil,
    and 7% for slope. The calibration and verification of parameters utilized monthly
    observation data of NH3–H and TP, with the base-flow separation using a digital
    filtering method (Chen, 2014). In addition to indicating the Goodness-of-Fit of
    the model, calibration and validation of the model adopted SWATCUP 2019, which
    is capable of calibration and validation of SWAT model (Güngör and Özdemir, 2015).
    Three objective functions were chosen to evaluate the predictive capability of
    calibrated model: the Nash-Sutcliffe efﬁciency (NSE) coefﬁcient (Nash and Sutcliffe,
    1970), which visualizes the accuracy of the measured and simulated results, the
    coefﬁcient of determination (R2) (Krause et al., 2005) and the percent bias (PBIAS)
    (Gupta et al., 1999). The performance of model could be deemed satisfactory when
    NSE and R2 values more than 0.50 (Moriasi et al., 2007), PBIAS value for runoff
    remains between ±25%, and TN and TP between ±70% (Moriasi et al., 2007). The performance
    of the SWAT model was evaluated by the NSE, R2 and PBIAS values, as presented
    in Eqs. (1), (2), (3): (1) (2) (3) Where is the observed value at moment ; is
    the simulated value at moment ; is the mean of the observations, ; is the mean
    of predicted value, and is the total number of observations. 2.2.2. BMPs description
    and representation in SWAT (1) Description of single BMP As indicated in Table
    2, parameters were established for every BMPs scenario. The watershed can be classified
    into four categories: tillage management, nutrient management, vegetative filter
    strips, and landscape management. Tillage management, a recognized practice for
    mitigate non-point pollution originating from various sources (Himanshu et al.,
    2019), comprises contour tillage (CT), parallel terracing (PT), contour hedgerow
    (CH), and strip tillage (ST), corresponding respectively to scenarios 1–4. Vegetative
    filter strips, denoted as VFS1, VFS3, VFS5, VFS10, and VFS20, apply to scenarios
    5–9 and span widths of 1 m, 3 m, 5 m, 10 m, and 20 m. Nutrient management is another
    source control measure, and scenarios 10–12 denote the reduction in fertilizer
    application by 10%, 20%, and 30%, represented as FR10%, FR20%, and FR30%. Landscape
    management, as delineated in Fig. 2b (42.24% cropland and 10.44% woodland), Fig.
    2c (39.37% cropland and 13.41% woodland), and Fig. 2d (29.96% cropland and 22.71%
    woodland), pertains to the grain for green program on slopes above 15° or 25°,
    designated as GFG15° and GFG25° (Wu et al., 2022). The program seeks to balance
    ecology and economy with ecological restoration as the center (Zhang, 2016). The
    reduction rates of TN and TP of GFG15° performed better than those corresponding
    to sub-watersheds of GFG25°, primarily due to the increased regional vegetation
    cover that effectively controls soil erosion and intercepts both nitrogen and
    phosphorus, thereby reducing non-point source pollution. (Wang, 2019). The empirical
    values of terrace slope length, field bank width designed and USLE_P factor for
    single BMP under different slopes in Fig. 2a, which are referenced by the available
    documentation (Arnold et al., 2012), respectively. In the JRB, the cropping pattern
    involved the rotation of winter wheat and summer corn. (2) Cost indicators Table

    source pollution by enhancing soil structure and augmenting precipitation infiltration
    (Naseri et al., 2021). As stated in the Law of the People''s Republic of China
    on the Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization (http://www.npc.gov.cn/npc/c12435/201811/55a63308b6354fcc9f03230dac7c591b.shtml),
    the conservation tillage subsidy program and related research propose three categories
    of tillage management, where CT, ST, and CH costs are 750 yuan/ha, 375 yuan/ha,
    and 2198 yuan/ha respectively (Wang et al., 2013; Yin, 2016). PT comes in at 4200
    yuan/ha (Huang, 2020; Kaini et al., 2012). According to Forestry and Grassland
    Ecological Protection and Restoration Funds Management Methods (http://www.forestry.gov.cn/zfxxgk.jhtml)
    in 2020 and the Notice of the State Council on Improving the Policy of Grain for
    Green in the subsidy funds management and other relevant provisions, the national
    subsidy cost for the grain for green averages 4200 yuan/ha (Huang, 2020; Wang,
    2021). The annual input cost for vegetative buffer strips per meter is estimated
    at RMB 1020 yuan/ha (Huang, 2020). According to Department of Agriculture and
    Rural Affairs of Shaanxi Province (http://nynct.shaanxi.gov.cn/www/gdhb/20230406/9819471.html),
    fertilizers with formula N–P2O5–K2O (13%-10%-17%) are applied at rates of 100
    kg/ha and 60 kg/ha for summer corn and winter wheat crops, respectively. Nitrogen
    and phosphorus are applied at dosages of 180 kg/ha and 50 kg/ha, while the prices
    of ammonium sulphate [(NH4)2SO4, phosphorus pentoxide [P2O5], and urea are estimated
    at 5 yuan/kg, 7 yuan/kg, and 2.5 yuan/kg, respectively. Consequently, considering
    the fractional content of nitrogen and phosphorus in the fertilizer, the total
    fertilizer application equates to 3972 yuan/ha (Arnold et al., 2012). (3) Multiple
    BMPs random combination The Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II)
    is employed to identify each position within the optimization space (Taboada and
    Coit, 2007), as illustrated in Fig. 3. Within the NSGA-Ⅱ component, each optimized
    combination ( ) corresponds to a specific string (Arabi et al., 2006), and the
    length of each chromosome corresponds to the total number of genes, namely. These
    genes can exist in either a ‘zero’ or ‘one’ state, symbolizing the type and location
    of conservation practice as decision variables. The binary type solely comprises
    ‘one’ or ‘zero’, indicating whether BMPs are implemented or not (Naseri et al.,
    2021). Download : Download high-res image (431KB) Download : Download full-size

    types BMPs, CH, CT, PT, ST, FR10%, FR20%, FR30%, VFS1, VFS3, VFS5, VFS10, VFS20,
    GFG15° and GFG25°, were implemented on cropland. Each of BMPs was individually
    evaluated compared to a base scenario where no BMPs was put. No conflicts were
    found among the selected measures in tillage management, nutrient management,
    vegetative filter strips, and landscape management categories. However, within
    each subcategory, only one measure can be selected, or none may be chosen at all.
    The constraint on the model stipulates that the decision variables adopt at most
    one type of measure in each subcategory. In other words, tillage management, vegetation
    buffer strips, nutrient management and landscape management can take 0–4 types
    in each sub-basin (0≤ ≤4). As a result, each sub-basin may potentially have up
    to 360 (5 × 6 × 4 × 3) combined BMPs scenarios. Therefore, in a watershed with
    59 sub-basins, there could potentially be up to 21,240 (5 × 6 × 4 × 3 × 59) BMPs
    combinations. The decision matrix characterizing whether to implement is calculated

    The Entropy Weight method (EWM) is employed in watershed management and pollution
    control, using objective assignment method to reduce the subjective influence
    on the weights of indicators (Sun et al., 2013). The purpose of the method was
    used to determining the weights of TN and TP based on the pollutant load. The
    steps involved are as follows: (ⅰ) Selection of evaluation factors Characteristic
    factors of water quality pollution are identified within each sub-basin, and a
    decision matrix is structured for different sub-basins. Here, , where, is the
    pollution of the sub-basin; and denote the number of sub-basins and evaluation
    factors, respectively. (ii) Decision Matrix Standardization The decision matrix
    is normalized by the extreme difference normalization method, which mitigates
    the impact of physical magnitude on the decision results between different factors.

    Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is a widely-used
    comprehensive evaluation method, capable of fully utilizing raw data. Its output
    accurately depicts the variances among distinct evaluation models (Meng et al.,
    2023). This study deployed TOPSIS to determine the weights of sub-watersheds based
    on ten evaluation factors. These factors include area of sub-basin, total amount
    of TP, TN and sediment, unit area loads of TP and TN, the quantity of sediment,
    the area of forest land, grassland, cropland, and the distance from the sub-watershed
    outlet to the total outlet. This method was selected with the objective of accounting
    for the varying reduction rates that occur due to spatial changes in sub-watersheds.
    (ⅰ) Determining the positive and negative ideal solution The formulas for converting
    extremely small, intermediate, and interval indicators into extremely large indicators
    are displayed in Eq. (19), (20), (21): (19) (20) (21) Where,{ } is a set of intermediate

    analysis of NSGA-Ⅱ parameters The hyperparameters of the NSGA-Ⅱ algorithm consist
    of population sizes, the number of generations, non-dominating sorting, selection,
    crossover probability, mutation probability and crowding distance (Ahmed and Deb,
    2013; Mohapatra et al., 2015). Typically, the parent and offspring chromosomes
    are amalgamated into a singular chromosome that maintains half the number of the
    original population, enabling operations in the subsequent generation (Deb et
    al., 2000). Therefore, in this study, half the number of the parents were also
    designated as the offspring. The optimization results of the NSGA-II were highly
    sensitive to parameters, which included population sizes and the number of generations.
    Modifying the hyperparameters of NSGA-II enabled the evaluation the of influence
    each parameter on the Pareto-optimal front (Srinivas and Deb, 1994). For the optimization
    process, the estimated parameters were those values at which the Pareto-optimal
    front curve approached the origin most closely in sensitivity analysis (Maringanti
    et al., 2009). The optimal parameters identified for the NSGA-II from the sensitivity
    analysis are presented in Table 3. The number of generations varied from 1000
    to 6000, while population sizes ranged from 100 to 1000. Table 3. NSGA-Ⅱ operating

    350 400 450 500 2.4.2. Multi-objective optimization framework The multi-objective
    optimization framework (depicted in Fig. 4), which integrated the NSGA-Ⅱ algorithm
    with SWAT, was comprised of four components: (i) The initial BMPs database, created
    by calculating the cost and reduction rate of TN and TP at the sub-watershed scale
    across fourteen BMPs, is utilized. This database was chosen with regard to the
    needs of non-point-source agricultural management (Gashaw et al., 2021; Himanshu
    et al., 2019). The parameters for these management practices have undergone calibrated
    and validated, as presented in Table 2. (ii) The combined reduction rate, formed
    by the combination of EWM and TOPSIS calculations, constitutes part of input database
    of NSGA-Ⅱ. The remainder of the initial BMPs database comprises the minimum total
    cost derived from local statistics. Thus, the minimum total cost and maximum reduction
    rate serve as the two objective functions of NSGA-II. (ⅲ) The initial Pareto-optimal
    front was generated from the decision variables from initial input database, which
    provides the decision space. Decision variables deriving from each variable in
    the decision matrix, form a decision space based upon the range of their values.
    According to the decision variables and two objective functions, the optimal populations
    and number of generations are obtained by iterating NSGA-Ⅱ continuously. Lastly,
    by continuously iterating the BMPs database and obtaining varying Pareto-optimal
    fronts, visualization is achieved. (iv) The initial BMPs database has been constructed
    utilizing Python and is based on the Pymoo library (Accessible at https://github.com/anyoptimization/pymoo),
    which hosts the NSGA-II multi-objective optimization functionality. In this research,
    the NSGA-Ⅱ algorithm was implemented as the optimization method to calculate the
    two objectives: maximizing the total amount of pollution reduction and minimizing
    the total cost, with the aim of attaining the optimal spatial distribution of
    BMPs at the sub-basin level. Download : Download high-res image (686KB) Download

    and 2018–2020 (Fig. 5). The validation periods were established as 2000–2017,
    2016–2019, 2018–2019. In the calibration period, the NSE for runoff, NH3–N and
    TP were 0.74, 0.76 and 0.89, respectively, while the R2 for runoff, NH3–N and
    TP were 0.68, 0.72 and 0.65. The PBIAS for runoff, NH3–N and TP were −10.7%, 13.9%
    and 10.2%, respectively. However, in the validation period, the NSE of runoff,
    NH3–N and TP were 0.74, 0.76 and 0.89, while the R2 values rose to 0.77, 0.93
    and 0.90. The PBIAS of flow, NH3–N and TP shifted to 21.6%, 3.7% and 29.4%, respectively.
    The results showed that the NSE, R2 and PBIAS of ﬂow, NH3–N and TP in Zhangjiashan
    or Linjing Village station were both greater than simulation of accreditation
    standards (Moriasi et al., 2007). Hence, the SWAT model reliably simulated trends
    for runoff, NH3–N and TP in the JRB, aligning with SWAT evaluation guidelines

    Sensitivity of NSGA-Ⅱ operational parameters The performance of the NSGA-Ⅱ not
    only enhanced accuracy through the optimized utilization of population sizes and
    the number of generations but minimized the computational time required to obtain
    the Pareto-optimal front (Rodriguez et al., 2011). The reduction rates of TN and
    TP from SWAT output, the cost of implementing measures, the BMPs have been implemented
    or not, formed the input for NSGA-Ⅱ. In the study, selection, crossover and mutation
    probability adopted default values. Furthermore, population sizes and the number
    of generations were specifically chosen as NSGA-Ⅱ iterative parameters to exhibit
    sensitivity, which assists in seeking the optimal parameters for ideal BMP spatial
    placement. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the optimal parameter setting for
    the number of generations and population size to be 5000 and 900, respectively.
    A smaller population size and fewer generations resulted in the Pareto-optimal
    front displaying a scattered distribution. However, an increase in population
    size and the number of generations led to a smoother, steadier Pareto-optimal
    front. As illustrated in Fig. 6a, the Pareto-optimal front curve steadily approached
    the origin as the number of generations grew from 1000 to 6000, stabilizing at
    5000 generations with a population size of 300. An improvement in the Pareto-optimal
    front became noticeable as the number of generations increased to 6000, depicted
    in Fig. 6a, correlated with a considerable increase in computation time. As for
    population sizes, observed in Fig. 6b, the Pareto-optimal front continued to improve
    within the range of 100–1000, with no significant improvement observed beyond
    a population size of 1000. Hence, 900 was identified as the optimal population
    size parameter. Considering the influence of the number of generations on the
    movement of the Pareto-optimal front towards the axes, a compromise was reached,
    selecting a total of 5000 generations for the optimization model of BMPs, as shown
    in Fig. 6c. Consequently, 5000 was deemed the optimal parameter for the number
    of generations. Download : Download high-res image (615KB) Download : Download

    3.3. Simulating the effectiveness of BMPs This study explored the influence of
    combined measures under fourteen BMPs at sub-watershed level, namely CT, PT, CH,
    ST, VFS1, VFS3, VFS5, VFS10, VFS20, FR10%, FR20%, FR30%, GFG15° and GFG25°. The
    effectiveness of these measures in reducing land surface within the SWAT model
    is illustrated in Fig. 7a and b. The graphs reveal significant discrepancies between
    the singular rates of TN and TP reduction. The TP reduction effect across the
    different BMPs appeared more uniform than that of TN, ranging between 0 and 10%,
    while TN reduction varied from 0 to 60%. These results suggest that different
    management measures significantly altered the reduction of non-point source pollution
    load. Notably, the reduction effect of GFG15° significantly surpassed those of
    other management measures. Among these measures, fertilizer reduction, vegetation
    filtration strips, and the grain for green proved the most effective in reducing
    the TN unit area, while tillage management emerged as the most effective strategy
    for TP reduction. Download : Download high-res image (483KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 7. Average annual rate of reduction of BMPs in the sub-watershed
    scale: (a) Reduction rate of TN; (b) Reduction rate of TP; (c) Combination reduction
    rate. Tillage management primarily curtails inter-farm runoff and the transport
    capacity of non-point source pollution by enhancing coverage and altering the
    microtopography of cropland (Himanshu et al., 2019). The reduce effect of TP surpassed
    that of TN, with reductions within the sub-watershed ranging from 1% to 36.25%.
    Conversely, the annual maximum average reduction rates of CH were 5.15% and 0.58%
    for TP and TN. Conversely, the annual minimum average reduction rates of ST were
    2.75% and 0.1% for TP and TN, namely. The impact of CT and PT, enhancing soil
    erosion and pollutant outflow, were similar, averaging an annual reduction rate
    of 0.06% and 3.97% for TP and TN. Cumulatively, the four types of CT, ST, PT and
    CH all adhere to tillage management with a hierarchy of reduction strategies in
    descending order as follows: CH > CT > PT > ST. Fertilizer reduction also diminished
    significant reductions in non-point source pollution, with the reduction rate
    increasing inversely to the level of fertilizer application. Fertilizer reduction
    at levels of 10%, 20%, 30% achieved annual reduction rates of 0.46%, 0.85% and
    1.33% for TP, 3.53%, 7.43% and 11.31% for TN, respectively, maintaining yield
    and while decreasing pollution load. Vegetation filter strips measuring 1 m, 5
    m, and 7 m, respectively, all demonstrated an annual average TP reduction rate
    of 1.01%. Conversely, TN reduction rates were 0.07%, 1.19%, and 47.30%, respectively.
    Indeed, reduction efficacy did not exhibit a linear growth relationship with increasing
    buffer width (He et al., 2014). The reduction efficiencies of vegetative filter
    strips within 10 m width were 0–3.68% for TN, with an average reduction efficiency
    of 2.03%. However, the reduction rates ranged from 9.09% to 15.74%, with an average
    reduction efficiency of 14.33% for TP. The grain for green program on slopes above
    15° reported better reduction rates for TN and TP compared to slopes above 25°.
    In all aforementioned agricultural management measures, the efficacy on TN reduction
    rate surpassed that of TP. The combined reduction rates for each sub-watershed
    were deduced based on their respective combined weights. Fig. 7c illustrates tillage
    management intensity varied from 0 to 21.43%, but most of them were concentrated
    within the 0–10% range. Interestingly, the combined reduction rates interestingly
    did not show any significant variation among tillage management measures, unlike
    the reduction effect seen from fertilizer usage. For FR10%, FR20%, and FR30%,
    the average combined reduction rates turned out to be estimated at around 3%,
    4%, and 5%, respectively. It implies that the reduction rate of fertilizer is
    linearly related to the decrease in its application. The consolidated reduction
    rates of vegetation filter strips equaled the single reduction rate of TN, suggesting
    that broader filter strips reduce higher reduction rates. Nevertheless, the effectiveness
    plateaus once the width exceeds 10 m, with the average reduction rate settling
    at about 6%. Remarkably, the reduction effect of GFG15° outperformed that of GFG25°,
    due to the provision of enhanced surface cover by forested land which in turn
    minimizes surface runoff when compared to cropland. The dispersion of GFG15° across
    sub-basins was not concentrated, which can be attributed to significant variations
    in the sizes of their respective cropland areas. Individual measures displayed
    variation in efficacy when reducing TN, with the ranking being as follows: GFG15°
    > VFS10 (or VFS20) > FR30% > FR20% > GFG25° > VFS5 > VFS3 > CH > VFS1, with the
    results for CT, PT and ST proving insubstantial. For TP, tillage management was
    slightly more impactful, with the remaining measures demonstrating comparable
    reduction rates. Excluding tillage management, TP reduction outperformed that
    of TN, whereas the other measures succeeded in reducing TN more efficiently than
    TP. In regards to combined efforts, the ranking result resembled that of individual
    TN measures. 3.4. Best co-management of the watershed 3.4.1. Spatial distribution
    of combined measures Combined measures were categorized into three scenarios,
    which were divided equally based on the result of the combined reduction rates.
    These scenarios met the restrictive constrains, despite noticeable differences
    in both reduction impact and overall cost. The BMPs spatial allocation under high-cost,
    medium-cost, and low-cost scenarios are depicted in Table 5. The scenarios were
    evenly divided into based on total watershed cost, labelled as high-cost, medium-cost,
    and low-cost respectively. The high-cost scenario, surpassing RMB 6 billion, demonstrated
    extreme efficiency and environmental responsibility. Investment in the high-cost
    scenario had the potential to make tremendous strides toward environmental conservation
    and foster a sustainable future. The medium-cost scenario emerged as the optimal
    solution, deftly balancing cost-efficiency with pollution reduction to create
    a cost-effective and environmentally responsible option. Lastly, the low-cost
    scenario, capping at RMB 2 billion, emerged as the least expensive situation.
    Despite its affordability, the scenario might lack ecological effectiveness compared
    to the higher-cost alternatives. Nevertheless, considering the total cost constraint
    across the entire watershed, these three scenarios were adjudged feasible solutions
    to achieve varying degrees of pollution reduction at different cost implications.

    3.4.2. Analysis of the reduction effect of combined measures In order to visually
    represent the geographical positioning of various BMPs, a spatial distribution
    of the most cost-effective BMPs is presented. The visualization offers a lucid
    understanding of the distribution and arrangement of these BMPs in JRB. Fig. 8
    demonstrates an arbitrary distribution of low-cost, medium-cost, and high-cost
    optimal conservation practices, represented by A, B and C, respectively. The grain
    for green program, identified as an effective TP and TN reduction measure (Wu
    et al., 2022), is a notable feature among all scenarios. Under the low-cost scenario,
    26 sub-basins remained untouched, the grain for green accounted for 69.13% among
    all measures in other sub-basins, of which 48.12% was GFG15°. Medium-cost and
    high-cost scenarios notably amplified the application of conservation practices.
    In both medium- and high-cost scenarios, the number of implemented measures increased
    substantially. The medium-cost solution predominantly utilized combinations such
    as GFG15°, FR30% + GFG15°, VFS20 + FR30% + GFG15° + ST, VFS20 + FR30% + GFG15°,
    GFG15° + ST and were mainly five combinations, they accounted for 20.00%, 15.10%,
    8.87%, 7.78% and 7.19% of the watershed, respectively. Remarkably, the medium-cost
    scenario was built upon the low-cost measures but offered a more diversified range
    of solutions. Similarly, high-cost scenario targeted heavily polluted sub-basins
    such as 16, 20, 21. In short, from low-cost to high-cost scenario, the number
    and cost of measures continued to increase, and the total amount of reduction
    increased correspondingly (Naseri et al., 2021). Download : Download high-res

    second, and third rows represent TN, TP, and a combined of TN and TP reduction,
    respectively. Similarly, the first, second, and third columns demonstrate the
    low-, medium-, and high-cost scenarios. The spatial concentration for TN and TP
    pollution largely overlapped, but variances were evident in the most polluted
    sub-basins. Specifically, TP was primarily found in sub-basins 14, 20, 31, 37,
    38, 44, 50, and 52, whereas TN was largely concentrated in sub-basins 1, 19, 20,
    21, 43, and 47. From the perspective of reduction, TN and TP spatial distributions
    remained consistent across low-, medium-, and high-cost scenarios. The low-cost
    scenario, dominated by the grain for green program, resulted in a reduction of
    22,649.79 kg for TN and 128.985 kg for TP. The medium-cost scenario, primarily
    the grain for green and fertilizer reduction, reduced TN and TP quantities by
    468,746.6 kg and 500.884 kg, respectively. Lastly, the high-cost scenario, featuring
    the broadest distribution of combined BMPs like the grain for green program, fertilizer
    reduction, and vegetative filter strips, facilitated the reduction of TN and TP
    by 621,222.4 kg and 671.687 kg, respectively. 4. Discussion 4.1. Analyzing the
    effectiveness of BMPs This study utilized the SWAT model to simulate the quantities
    of NH3–H and TP, and subsequently evaluated the reduction impacts of implementing
    various BMPs. An Optimal spatial allocation method was employed, which involved
    selecting BMP combinations through a stochastic approach. The methodology was
    constructed through the integration of the NSGA-II optimization algorithm with
    the SWAT model. Finally, three scenarios of combinations of low-cost, medium-cost,
    and high-cost measures were proposed to adapt to different cost-effectiveness
    choices. From a single reduction rate perspective, TP demonstrated superior reduction
    efficiency compared to TN, primarily attributable to the largely particulate nature
    of phosphorus (Wu, 2022). Tillage management through the surface micro-topography
    to carry out reasonable changes and increases in the surface cover, to slow down
    the surface runoff and reduce soil erosion of arable land (Wang et al., 2013).
    It had significant spatial variability, especially on TP, which aligns with previous
    study (Han et al., 2015). Reasonable reduction in fertilizer application enhances
    the utilization rate of fertilizer, mitigates nutrient loss, maintains grain yield,
    and lessens the impact on the water environment (Lee et al., 2010). Fertilizer
    reduction is significantly more effective in reducing TN than TP, identical conclusions
    were obtained because that the nitrogen content of fertilizers in JRB is higher
    than the phosphorus content, Consequently, reducing the application of fertilizers
    causes a more significant decrease in the nitrogen content of runoff. Additionally,
    non-point source pollution load reduction owing to reduced fertilization exhibits
    strong regional specificity and is heavily influenced by variations in precipitation
    and agricultural management techniques (Sun, 2020). Previous research reported
    reduction rates of 22% and 31% for TN and TP, respectively (Liu et al., 2014),
    but the reduction of 20% in the application of fertilizer reduction had little
    impact on the control of nitrogen and phosphorus (Chang, 2017). With a reduction
    rate of less than 10%, an exponential increase in the percentage of fertilizer
    reduction did not correspondingly yield an exponential increase in the reduction
    percentage (Huang, 2020). Vegetation filter strips are effective method for mitigating
    nitrogen and phosphorus pollution through filtration, interception, sedimentation,
    adsorption, plant uptake and other physical, chemical, and biological effects.
    Therefore, they also contribute to reducing water-induced soil erosion (Wu et
    al., 2010). Research indicates that these strips are notably more efficient at
    minimizing TN than TP (Zhang, 2021a; Zheng, 2019). Predominantly, phosphorus exists
    in a soluble form, and while the strips can decelerate runoff and intercept particulates,
    their effectiveness in reducing soluble TP is limited (Huang, 2020). Vegetation
    filter strips of 10 m and 20 m width exhibit similar reduction rates at the sub-basin
    scale, beyond a certain width threshold, the reduction rate remained largely unchanged
    (Hu et al., 2015). Significantly, under the grain for green program, the reduction
    rates of TN and TP in regions with a slope exceeding 15° overcome those in areas
    with a slope above 25°. The reason was that the slope of above 15° cropland area
    was larger than above 25°, so the more area of woodland the effect on decreasing
    soil erosion and intercepting agricultural surface pollution better. The amount
    of agricultural surface pollution load of organic nitrogen and NH3–H unit area
    of cropland were huge, and increased woodland area as a barrier to reduce pollution
    load. Thus, woodland could effectively reduce the output of TN than cropland.
    From the perspective of comprehensive reduction rate, the trend of comprehensive
    reduction rate changing was similar to that of TN changing. 4.2. Best co-management
    of the watershed Although numerous current studies of watershed-specific management
    measures used cost-effectiveness bi-objective of optimizing total cost and reduction
    effect, they focused primarily on optimizing used for a single pollutant (Geng
    et al., 2019). The proposed combination reduction rate in this study, conceived
    by integrating EWM and TOPSIS, incorporates weights of non-point sources and individual
    contaminants in sub-basins. The method was more in line with the fact contamination
    reality of JRB to allocate the corresponding BMPs in an equivalent manner. Multiple
    combinations of BMPs across 59 sub-watersheds were determined using the NSGA-II
    method. The results of low-cost, medium-cost, and high-cost scenarios coincided
    with the findings of previous studies (Maringanti et al., 2009; Naseri et al.,
    2021). Overall, the ranking of reduction effects was: low-cost < medium-cost <
    high-cost, specifically, higher reduction rates corresponded to more BMPs being
    implemented in sub-watersheds. Although this provides a cost scheme for BMPs configurations
    at the basin scale, it neglects configurations focused on critical source areas.
    Generally, critical source areas are the priority implementation locations for
    BMPs, which can improve the efficiency of different BMPs in reducing non-point
    pollution and achieve economic costs (Ruan, 2019; Wu, 2022). The differences research
    scales also offer a plausible explanation. The study utilized sub-basins consisting
    of numerous hydrologic response units, necessitating smaller scale exploration
    (Geng et al., 2016). The proposed methodology could be effectively broadened and
    applied to other watersheds for prioritized BMPs for non-point source pollution
    control. Although the BMPs configurations span across the entire watershed, they
    present decision-makers with a trade-off between total cost and reduction efficiency.
    Integrating a stakeholder interest index into the optimization process enables
    a comprehensive decision-making methodology that carefully addresses local economic
    necessities. The methodology for optimal co-management can be extended to other
    watersheds to identify appropriate BMPs. The approach considers stakeholder interests
    in terms of total cost and reduction effect, thereby ensuring a comprehensive
    and inclusive decision-making process. However, It still faces numerous challenges.
    The values of the NSGA-II hyper-parameters during the optimization process influence
    the location distribution of the BMPs (Naseri et al., 2021; Panagopoulos et al.,
    2012). Yet, the selection, crossover, and mutation operators adopted default values
    in determining the population and generation, which may affect the accuracy of
    BMPs. The SWAT calibration and validation process may also produce identical results
    from different parameter combinations, adding inevitable uncertainty (Geng et
    al., 2016; Naseri et al., 2021). Furthermore, the limitation in the types and
    accuracy in the BMPs database may influence sub-optimal BMP selection. Future
    studies could consider more measures such as sediment reduction weight, grain
    for grassland strategies, and river-related measures. Moreover, future research
    could incorporate additional objective functions, for instance, eco-efficiency
    and water quality compliance. Further examination into the cost-effectiveness
    of these management measures could also be expanded to more detailed hydrological
    response units, but research in this area requires a lot of measured data (Geng
    et al., 2016). 5. Conclusions The study presents an innovative optimization framework
    for identifying and developing the optimal BMPs combinations at the watershed
    scale. The primary objectives of the framework are to maximum the combined reduction
    rate by coupling TN and TP, and minimize the total cost associated with implementing
    fourteen BMPs. The framework divided equally into three optimal BMP solutions
    situated on the Pareto-optimal and provides valuable insights and recommendations
    for stakeholders in terms of watershed management. There were three major conclusions
    as follows. (i) The study introduces a novel framework to gauge the combined reduction
    rate for each sub-basin, achieved through the implementation of EWM and TOPSIS.
    The model factors in the weights of TN and TP and considers ten various aspects
    such as area of sub-basin, total amount of TP, and TN and sediment. Consequently,
    it not only made the reduction rates having a stronger suitability in JRB, but
    also adopted to other regions to identify and prioritize the most effective BMPs.
    (ii) Four primary categories of measures, tillage management, nutrient management,
    vegetative filter strips, and landscape management, are arbitrarily amalgamated
    into a maximum of 21,240 combinations throughout the watershed based on NSGA-II.
    Three cost scenarios, namely, low-cost, medium-cost, and high-cost, are selected
    from within the Pareto-optimal front with each selected to satisfy stakeholder
    interests. (iii) The amalgamation of NSGA-II and the BMPs database, derived from
    the output of SWAT model after local data-driven calibration and validation, not
    only profoundly accelerates the optimization process and reduces computational
    complexity, but also robustly seeks optimal BMPs that maximize nutrient reduction
    rates and minimize total cost. Nevertheless, future research could consider incorporating
    additional multi-objective functions and extending the framework to the level
    of individual hydrologic response units. Credit author statement Xueting Wang:

    1. Introduction Due to the rapid expansion of cities, impervious surfaces such
    as buildings, parking lots, and pavements multiply, while the area of rivers,
    wetlands, and green spaces with purification functions in the city decrease. In
    addition, climate change has increased the frequency and intensity of extreme
    rainfall, further increasing urban stormwater runoff(Yao et al., 2022). These
    urban stormwater runoff and pollutants mix, which causes serious urban non-point
    source pollution and continued deterioration of the water quality in urban areas(Che
    et al., 2002; Deng et al., 2012; Dietz, 2007; Khan et al., 2006; She et al., 2021;
    Yao et al., 2022). This is a pressing issue in China, which has expanded rapidly
    as a developing country, where the urbanization rate reached 60% in 2019(Wang
    et al., 2021). In response to urban non-point source pollution, China has introduced
    Sponge City stormwater management policies. The concept of Sponge City is akin
    to low impact development design (LID), water sensitive urban design (WSUD), and
    sustainable development urban drainage system (SUDS), among others, which can
    also be called as the construction of low impact development rainwater system(Guan
    et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2020). A Sponge City comprises a sponge-like system
    with components such as wetlands, rain gardens, bioretention, green roof spaces,
    and permeable pavements(Guan et al., 2021). It follows the principles of “source
    reduction, process control, and system management” to enhance cities'' resilience
    in adapting to climate change and resisting heavy rainfall(Yao et al., 2022).
    Wetland as one of stormwater management facilities has proven to be effective
    in mitigating the pollution of urban non-point source pollution, and generally
    requires comparatively little input costs (construction, operation and maintenance),
    so it has become increasingly important in many practical applications of non-point
    source pollution treatment(Ravikumar et al., 2022). Wetland can remove total nitrogen
    (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand
    (COD), and heavy metals through various processes such as filtration, adsorption,
    chemical precipitation, plant uptake, decomposition, and precipitation(Birch et
    al., 2004; Swarnakar et al., 2022; Walker and Hurl, 2002). The pollution removal
    effects of TN, TP, SS, and COD are as high as 73.2%, 89.0%, 80.4%, and 84.3% respectively,
    in wetlands with specific combination methods(Zhou et al., 2021). Wetlands are
    more complex ecosystems compared to other Sponge City facilities such as green
    spaces land, permeable pavement, green spaces roofs, and vegetative swales. Thus,
    when planning, additional environmental factors need to be taken into account.
    In fact, numerous wetlands fail or do not perform better due to poor planning
    or design(Rodrigo, 2021; Ryan, 2022; Van Lonkhuyzen et al., 2004). Therefore,
    in the wetland planning of Sponge City, it is essential to conduct quantitative
    analyses not only for wetland benefits and input costs, but also for wetland restoration
    potential (the object of this paper is the constructed wetland, so it refers to
    constructed wetland potential). However, in the existing research on wetland multi-objective
    optimization, no study has incorporated constructed wetland potential as a distinct
    objective that can be quantitatively analyzed within a multi-objective analysis
    system. Constructed wetland potential often requires consideration of geological
    and hydrological factors such as elevation, slope, river network, soil type, land
    use, etc.(Ha and Lee, 2006; Horvath et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2016; Pal and Singha,
    2022; White and Fennessy, 2005). These studies typically assign different weights
    to various geological and hydrological factors and obtain the constructed wetland
    potential value through the ArcGIS weighted analysis method. In addition, wetland
    benefit (pollutant removal, flood regulation, biodiversity, etc.)(Babbar-Sebens
    et al., 2013; Djodjic et al., 2020; Singh et al., 2019; Yang and Best, 2015) and
    input costs (construction cost)(Yang and Best, 2015; Singh et al., 2019) are usually
    considered in wetland multi-objective optimization studies. Yang and Best (2015)
    considered wetland benefit (TN removal) and input costs to optimize BMP (wetland
    and buffer strip) space using the NSGA-II method. Singh et al. (2019) optimized
    wetland space using the genetic algorithm method considering wetland benefit (P
    removal) and input costs. The wetlands optimization models presented in these
    studies are limited in assisting spatial planning decisions for larger urban areas
    because the suitable sites of wetlands are predefined in the optimization process,
    and quantitative analysis of the constructed wetland potential within the optimization
    process has not been included. These methods also fail to provide support when
    urban planning decision-makers consider the trade-off between constructed wetland
    potential and input costs. In addition, although constructed wetland potential,
    wetland benefits and input costs are critical considerations in wetland planning
    and design, in previous studies, we have not found a wetland spatial optimization
    model that simultaneously analyzes the trade-off relationship between the three
    objectives. Cities in the plains are flat and the elevation difference is tiny,
    so it is more difficult to subjectively compare the quality of wetland site selection
    in wetland planning and design(Wang et al., 2020). Wetlands in Plains cities require
    more detailed quantitative analysis to select more reasonable wetland locations.
    In this paper, we focus on cities in plain areas for multi-objective optimization
    of the Sponge City wetland. In order to develop a spatial optimization model for
    decision-making support on selecting optimal wetland sites across urban areas,
    this paper aims to fill the research gap by including constructed wetland potential,
    wetland benefits (this paper mainly calculates TN mass removal) and input costs
    and verifying the effectiveness of the model''s identified optimal wetlands against
    an actual plan in Shangqiu city, China. The research method is as follows: First,
    the spatial data of the study area is mapped, the function formula of the three
    objectives is decided, and Pareto optimal solutions (wetlands spatial optimization
    schemes) are obtained through the NSGA-II. Second, the three values (constructed
    wetland potential, TN mass removal, and input costs) of the planned wetlands are
    calculated through the function formula of this model, and the Pareto optimal
    solutions are compared to the planned wetlands in Shangqiu to verify the model''s
    effectiveness. Finally, four wetland optimization schemes are proposed through
    the preferences of each objective and the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference
    by Similarity to Ideal Solution) method. 2. Research method 2.1. Study area The
    study area was selected based on the following conditions: 1. city in the plain
    and accessibility of relevant spatial information (elevation, land use map, soil
    type map, rainfall data), 2. significant urban non-point source pollution, 3.
    a wetland planning scheme has been created. Based on the above conditions, the
    downtown area of Shangqiu in the eastern part of Henan Province, China was selected
    as the study area. The area is drawn by Shangqiu Master Plan (2016–2035), with
    a total area of 382.5km2 (Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Map showing the location and outline of the
    study area. Shangqiu is mainly located in the Yellow River alluvial plain, with
    simple topography and good geological environment (no geological hazards, groundwater
    and soil pollution, flat overall slope etc.), which provides good prerequisites
    for wetland construction(Wang et al., 2020; Wang and Guo, 2022). In addition,
    Shangqiu is high in the northwest and low in the southeast, and is flat, with
    an average slope of 1:5000–1:7000 (Xu et al., 2020). However, there are many small-scale
    topographic variations such as sand dunes, beach land, ponds, pothole, and lake
    depressions intersecting each other. The average annual precipitation in Shangqiu
    is 741 mm, and the average annual temperature is 14.7 °C(Shangqiu Municipal Government,
    2023). Due to the serious nitrogen pollution in surface water, 82% of surface
    water system was black and odorous with NH3-N levels of >8.0 mg/L(Housing and
    Urban-Rural Development, 2015; Xu et al., 2020). The municipal government of Shangqiu
    city has released the black and odorous water treatment planning (2016–2035),
    aiming to achieve the objective of attaining surface water quality of IV standard
    (NH3-N ≤ 1.5 mg/L, TN ≤ 1.5 mg/L, etc.) in the surface water system by 2035(State
    bureau of environment protection and quarantine, 2002; Xu et al., 2020). The plan
    focuses on enhancing water quality through various means, including the use of
    sewage treatment plants, overflow pollution facilities, riverside green space,
    and the construction of 13 wetlands covering a total area of 84 ha (accounting
    for 0.2% of the study area). The site selection of planned wetlands is mainly
    in large parks near river, green spaces land near river, farmland near river,
    and water supply places of reclaimed water. The wetlands located near the reclaimed
    water supply site can not only purify the urban non-point source pollution, but
    also purify the recycled water. After the water quality reaches the IV standard,
    it will be discharged into the river to supplement the ecological water (Xu et
    al., 2020). For the specific location of planned wetlands, please refer to Shangqiu
    Sponge City planning (2016–2035)(Shangqiu Municipal Administration, 2019b). 2.2.
    Construction of a multi-objective model Due to the serious nitrogen pollution
    in the rivers of the study site, TN removal was taken as a objective of wetland
    space optimization, which is also consistent with the purpose of the planned wetlands
    (Xu et al., 2020). Constructed wetland potential and input costs are also important
    factors to be considered by decision-makers. Therefore, maximizing restoration
    constructed wetland potential and minimizing input costs are two other objectives
    of wetland space optimization. The study area was divided into 38,141 land units,
    each measuring 1 ha (100 m × 100 m), which is the smallest wetland area considered.
    Compared to the planned wetlands, wetlands with the same area (see to 2.1) were
    selected for the study. The values of the three objectives were computed for each
    land unit. Thus, the spatial optimization problem involves selecting the optimal
    combination of 84 land units from the total of 38,141 units. If multiple adjacent
    land units are selected, they are aggregated and treated as a larger wetland,
    with its area constrained by the catchment area (refer to Section 2.2.2). This
    paper used NSGA-II and ArcGIS (10.8) to build a multi-objective spatial optimization
    model. As one of the most famous multi-objective optimization algorithms, the
    NSGA-II algorithm has been widely used in many research fields(Galvani et al.,
    2022), and can find a better uniform distribution of solutions and better convergence
    near the true Pareto optimal front(Deb et al., 2002). In recent years this method
    has also been widely used in low impact development-best management practices
    (LID-BMPs) construction(Ghodsi et al., 2020; Raei et al., 2019), and has been
    applied to spatial optimization of wetlands as well(Singh et al., 2019; Yang and
    Best, 2015). The NSGA-II algorithm is implemented through a python library for
    genetic algorithms (http://geatpy.com/). 2.2.1. Data and function of constructed
    wetland potential Wetland construction or restoration generally considers economics,
    geological, hydrological, and environmental factors, and the scoring systems for
    each factor varies depending on the objectives of construction or restoration
    (Moreno-Mateos et al., 2010; Pal and Singha, 2022; Palmeri and Trepel, 2002).
    In this paper, we adopt the scoring system for each factor developed by Palmeri
    and Trepel (2002), because it shares a common objective with our research (improving
    water quality). Furthermore, this system incorporates more comprehensive impact
    elements and employs a more detailed scoring systems. Palmeri and Trepel (2002)
    analyzed three different scoring systems according to the emphasis on economics
    and geology, or geology and hydrology, or economics and environment. As this study
    focuses on the analysis of constructed wetland potential, we refer to the scoring
    system dominated by geology and hydrology. The data used for scoring system for
    geology and hydrology involves elevation, slope, river network, soil type, land
    use, and presence of wetland areas in the past (Palmeri and Trepel, 2002; White
    and Fennessy, 2005). We determined the scoring system by combining the characteristics
    of the study area, referring to Palmeri and Trepel (2002) and related studies
    of wetland scoring systems (Table 1). The land unit scores we calculated using
    Table 1 ranged from 40.5 to 137. Fig. 2 shows the spatial distribution map of
    each evaluation element score. Table 1. Constructed wetland potential evaluation

    map of criterion score of (a) elevation, (b) slope, (c) land use, (d) soil type,
    (e) river distance, (f) Recycled water pipelines distance. The elevation and slope
    play a crucial role in hydrological processes and the spatial distribution of
    water. For instance, they directly influence surface water flow and soil moisture(Phillips,
    1990; White and Fennessy, 2005). Low elevation areas or depressions suitable for
    constructing wetlands can effectively capture and retain more stormwater runoff,
    reducing the need for pump installations(McCauley and Jenkins, 2005; Moreno-Mateos
    et al., 2010). Thus, low elevations are assigned higher scores. The elevation
    scoring needs to be adjusted to the actual conditions of the study area, in order
    to be able to better select the low elevation or depressions suitable for the
    construction of wetlands(Palmeri and Trepel, 2002; White and Fennessy, 2005).
    Therefore, we adjusted the elevation scoring criteria to match the actual conditions
    of the study area (adjusting the range of each scoring level from 10 m to 5 m).
    To reduce the vertical error of the elevation data, we selected the elevation
    of TanDEM-X DEMs(TanDEM-X 12 m, TanDEM-X 30 m, TanDEM-X 90 m), which is a new
    elevation dataset produced by the German Aerospace Center (DLR), and is currently
    the best global elevation data available (Grohmann, 2018; Hawker et al., 2019).
    Among the TanDEM-X data options, we chose the TanDEM-X 90 m data, which is freely
    available and has a mean error of 1.06 m and a bare error of 0.03 m (Hawker et
    al., 2019). We downloaded this dataset measured in winter (January 2023) from
    this link: https://download.geoservice.dlr.de/TDM90/. During winter, after the
    leaves fall off the trees, non-urban areas such as green spaces and farmlands
    become more like bare ground, reducing the error to a level close to the bare
    ground error (0.03). Although the presence of buildings can increase the vertical
    error, it does not significantly affect the results because the model does not
    select areas unsuitable for wetland construction. In the scoring system, altitudes
    (orthometric heights) are generally used, so we converted the ellipsoidal height
    of the TanDEM-X 90 m to altitudes through ArcGIS (10.8) and replaced the extreme
    values with the maxima and minimum values after removing the extreme values. Flatter
    areas are favorable for wetland construction, while steeper areas are less suitable
    for creating wetlands(Moorhead, 1991). Higher slopes can also increase the cost
    of constructed wetlands(Moreno-Mateos et al., 2010). Additionally, vegetation
    growing at the water''s edge tends to grow faster when the slope is below about
    5% and develops more slowly when the slope is above 10%(Lim and Kim, 2009). Therefore,
    areas with slopes of 10% or more are assigned lower grade scores. The study area
    has a maximum slope of 8%, and majority of the area has slopes within 1%, with
    only a small portion having slopes >5% (Fig. 2(b)). The slope data were generated
    using TanDEM-X 90 m data via ArcGIS (10.8). Land use type reflects the level of
    human disturbance and cost-effectiveness (Moreno-Mateos et al., 2010; Qu et al.,
    2018) and influences the migration of species, material and energy exchange(Ou
    et al., 2011). Therefore, it significantly impacts the success of wetland construction(Qu
    et al., 2018). The existing land use map of Shangqiu is no longer highly applicable
    due to rapid development and substantial changes in land use. Therefore, we made
    a detailed land use map through ArcGIS (10.8) based on the Shangqiu planning scheme
    (2015–2035)(Shangqiu Municipal Government, 2018) and combined with the 2018 Shangqiu
    Land Use (http://data.ess.tsinghua.edu.cn). Soil type is a representative factor
    for wetland restoration or construction(Qu et al., 2018) and reflects the water
    storage capacity of the soil(Moreno-Mateos et al., 2010; Whitis, 2007). The soils
    with high water holding capacity are more conducive to sustaining wetlands, thus
    receiving higher grade scores (Tang et al., 2012). In this study, the soil types
    ranked in descending order of moisture content were solonetz, fluvo-aquic soil
    (loamy), and fluvo-aquic soil (silty) (Zhang et al., 2019), which differ from
    the soil types in the reference paper(Palmeri and Trepel, 2002), necessitating
    adjustments to the scoring criteria for soil types. The higher the water content,
    more suitable the soil for constructed wetlands (Palmeri and Trepel, 2002; Van
    Lonkhuyzen et al., 2004), and since the water content of solonetz is greater than
    glacial till, we can assign a score for solonetz based on Palmeri and Trepel (2002).
    Additionally, fluvo-aquic soil (loamy) and fluvo-aquic soil (silty) have higher
    water content and are more suitable soils for constructed wetlands(Ma et al.,
    2016), therefore we can determine their scores based on Palmeri and Trepel (2002).
    Wetland systems are particularly fragile, especially in terms of water availability,
    and even small changes in water availability (in quality or quantity) can lead
    to significant changes in plant communities and animal habitats(Acreman et al.,
    2007). Since the river plays a vital role in ensuring a stable water source for
    wetlands and significantly influences the total cost of wetland construction(Moreno-Mateos
    et al., 2010), it carries the greatest weighting in the scoring system. The area
    within 150 m from river is considered to be the area where the increase in energy
    and cost required to construct wetlands is not significant(Moreno-Mateos et al.,
    2010), As a result, the area within 150 m is assigned a high grade score. We obtained
    the Shangqiu river network data from OpenStreetMap (https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=11/34.3930/115.6572).
    Due to insufficient winter rainfall in the study area, wetland water supply is
    ensured by utilizing recycled water as a supplementary source in the planned wetlands.
    Therefore, the “Recycled Water Pipelines distance” is included in the scoring
    system. Since it serves the same purpose (providing a water source) as the river,
    we assign it the same weight as the river. We obtained the network planning map
    of Shangqiu Recycled Water Pipelines (2016–2035) from the Shangqiu Municipal Administration
    website(Shangqiu Municipal Administration, 2019a). Since historical wetland data
    is unavailable, past wetland areas are not considered. Constructed wetland potential
    is calculated using to the scoring system in Table 1 by Eq. 1. (1) where is the
    index of land units selected as wetland; is the weighted value of elevation, slope,
    land use, soil type, river distance, and Recycled Water Pipelines distance; is
    the criterion score of elevation, slope, land use, soil type, river distance and
    Recycled Water Pipelines distance of th land unit selected as a wetland. 2.2.2.
    Data and function of TN removal Because the newly constructed wetland ecosystem
    is still unstable and cannot reflect the TN removal capacity of wetlands, this
    study calculates the TN removal quality of the wetland with a relatively stable
    ecosystem. Jordan et al. (2011) analyzed many wetland studies on TN removal to
    evaluate the factors affecting TN removal rates. Regardless of changes in wetland
    type and other factors, the results showed that there was a positive near-linear
    relationship between TN loading and TN removal (Eq. 2) and about 82% of the variation
    is determined by the regression model ( ). Yang and Best (2015) applied Eq. 2
    to calculate the TN removal of wetlands. Including all the influencing variables
    in a regression model is almost impossible in practical applications (Yang and
    Best, 2015). Therefore, in this paper, the TN removal function (Eq. 3) of wetland
    was determined according to Eq. 2. Through this calculation formula, the model
    can select the catchment with high TN load, and further select the pixels with
    high TN load in the catchment. In addition, the model can calculate the TN mass
    flowing into the wetland based on the total exported TN mass in each catchment,
    and finally calculate the TN removed mass of the wetland. (2) (3) (3a) (3b) (3c)
    (3d) where is the TN mass removed per area per time (g/m2/year); is the TN loading
    loaded into a wetland (g/m2/year); is the index of land units selected as wetland;
    is the area of land units (m2); is the TN load of land unit ( ) (g/m2/year); is
    the total exported TN mass of the catchments after wetland sites selection is
    determined (g/year); is the total exported TN mass of the catchment before wetland
    site selection is determined (g/year); is the number of land units selected as
    wetlands in the catchment; is the total TN mass loaded into a wetland (g/year);
    is the first flush area (only this portion of the first flush stormwater flows
    into the wetland). The first flush typically originates from upstream areas within
    this small catchment, referring to the initial runoff from early stages of rainfall(Maniquiz-Redillas
    et al., 2022). is the catchment area; is the wetlands area. We specify that the
    sum of the wetland and first flush areas are no larger than the catchment area
    (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image (331KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. Wetlands, first flush and catchment relationships. The total exported
    TN mass of the catchment is constantly changing with the selected location of
    the wetland. When a land unit ( ) is selected as a wetland, the TN load of this
    land unit becomes 0, and the total exported TN mass of the catchment will be recalculated.
    Wetlands can collect TN mass from surrounding land or upstream of the catchment,
    and the total TN mass loaded into a wetland ( ) is determined by the TN mass of
    the first flush area. Since the mass of TN loaded into a wetland cannot be precisely
    calculated and the terrain of the study area is flat, so is simplified as times
    the first flush and wetland area fraction of a catchment (Eq. 3b)(Yang and Best,
    2015). In general, the wetland area is typically 1%–5% of the first flush area(Xiao
    et al., 2013). In this study, we use the average value of 3% to calculate the
    first flush area. Using the elevation and river network of the study area, the
    study area is divided into 109 catchments by ArcSWAT. The total exported TN mass
    of the catchment and the TN load map was created by the Nutrient Delivery Ratio
    (NDR) of the InVEST model (https://naturalcapitalproject.stanford.edu/software/invest-models/sediment-retention).
    Because the InVEST model is simple to operate, fast to calculate, and powerful
    in spatial representation capabilities, it is the most widely used model in the
    world(Yang et al., 2019). The NDR module is specifically designed for TN and TP
    exports and has been used in many parts of the world (Yang et al., 2019). The
    data needed for this model are elevation (elevation), land use/land cover, precipitation,
    catchment, and others (Table 2). Table 2. Input of the data for the InVEST model.

    of input costs In this paper, input costs include land prices, construction cost,
    and operation and maintenance (O&M) cost. The land prices range from 108 CNY /
    m2 for farmland to 4000 CNY /m2 for commercial land(Shangqiu Municipal Government,
    2020a, Shangqiu Municipal Government, 2020b). According to the research(She et
    al., 2021; Xu et al., 2022; Yang and Best, 2015), in the space optimization or
    site selection of LID-BMP-BC facilities, a specific value is generally used to
    calculate the construction cost. The wetland construction cost of Sponge City
    in Beijing is 500–700 CNY / m2 (Housing and Development, 2014). Differences in
    material cost, labor cost, and design parameters in different cities can affect
    the construction cost of Sponge City facilities(She et al., 2021). The material
    cost and labor cost of Shangqiu are lower than that of Beijing, so the lower 500
    CNY / m2 is chosen as the wetland construction cost. To emphasize the difference
    in input costs due to the location of the wetland, reduced the O&M cost impact
    on construction cost. Therefore only 1-year the annual average O&M cost is calculated
    as part of the input costs. According to research(Houle et al., 2013), the O&M
    is set at 4.3 CNY / m2 / year (the average of wet pond and gravel wetland). The
    final function (Eq. 4) of input costs is as follows: (4) where is the index of
    land units selected as wetland; is the area of land (m2); is the cost of th land
    unit selected as wetland (CNY / m2); is the cost of constructing wetlands (500CNY
    / m2); is the cost of the O&M (4.3CNY / m2). 2.2.4. Optimization process The process
    of the spatial optimization model based on NSGA-II is as follows (Fig. 4). First,
    the data of each objective was processed by ArcGIS, and the function of each objective
    was decided. Second, the chromosome encoding, input parameters, and the initial
    population were designed according to the type, purpose, and scale of the research
    question. Third, through the non-dominated sorting, suitable individuals were
    selected from the initial population and used for crossover and mutation operations.
    Later, the population consisting of parents and offspring were obtained. Finally,
    better individuals in the population were selected through calculating non-dominated
    sorting and crowding distance, and a new parent population was secured. This process
    was repeated until the set termination condition was reached, and finally, the
    Pareto optimal solutions were obtained. Download : Download high-res image (560KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Optimization process of the optimization
    model for Wetland site selection. The number of land units in the research area
    is large (38,141), which makes it difficult in the search for the optimal solution.
    To improve the effectiveness and accuracy of the search, the initial population
    was selected in the field where the best solution can be found (sites within 300
    m of the river). Based on prior studies, the crossover rate and mutation rate
    were set at 0.9 and 0.001, respectively (Babbar-Sebens et al., 2013; Yang and
    Best, 2015). Due to the large search range, the population multiple was set to
    2000, which increased the amount of computation but reduced the risk of falling
    into a local optimum. Every 100 generations of calculation, the coordinates of
    the optimal solutions (the locations of the wetland) were imported into the ArcGIS
    and spatial distribution of the wetlands was generated. When the spatial distribution
    was no longer altered for every generation, the computation was terminated. 2.3.
    Comparison of planned wetlands and Pareto optimal solutions First, a spatial map(100
    m × 100 m) of the planned wetlands was created. Second, according to the spatial
    data of the three objectives of the planned wetlands, the input costs, TN mass
    removal, and constructed wetland potential values from each function were obtained.
    Finally, the value of each objective function of the planned wetlands and the
    value of each objective function by the Pareto optimal solutions was compared
    and analyzed to test the effect of the model. 2.4. Wetland optimization schemes
    selection From the Pareto optimal solutions, four wetland optimization schemes
    with the highest economic benefit scheme for constructed wetland potential, highest
    economic benefit scheme for pollutant removal efficiency, the best compromise
    scheme between three objectives, and highest constructed wetland potential scheme
    were selected to provide reference for urban decision-makers. The highest economic
    benefit scheme for constructed wetland potential is one with the largest ratio
    of constructed wetland potential to input costs among the Pareto optimal solutions.
    The highest economic benefit scheme for pollutant removal efficiency is one with
    the largest ratio of pollutant removal to input costs among the Pareto optimal
    solutions. The best compromise scheme between three objectives is calculated by
    the TOPSIS method using the Pareto optimal solutions. This method is commonly
    used when choosing the final solution in a multi-objective optimization scheme
    (Behzadian et al., 2012; Locatelli and Mancini, 2012; Souier et al., 2019; Zheng
    et al., 2017). For example, Zheng et al. (2017) selected the best compromise of
    the three objectives from the Pareto optimal solutions by the TOPSIS method. The
    principle and calculation process of the TOPSIS method refer to the previous research
    paper(Behzadian et al., 2012). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Pareto optimal solutions
    Fig. 5 shows the change in the value of each objective throughout generations.
    It can be found that after 500 generations, the function values of all objectives
    have reached a balanced state. In addition, the spatial distribution of wetlands
    did not change after 500 generations (Fig. 6a). Thus, after 500 generations of
    evolution, the Pareto front or the approximate Pareto front is obtained. Simultaneously,
    1708 Pareto optimal solutions satisfying the three objectives were obtained, which
    can serve as a foundation for decision-makers to select the most suitable option
    based on planning requirements, preferences, available funds, and other considerations.

    Fig. 5. (a) Constructed wetland potential varies with the number of generations;
    (b) TN mass removal varies with the number of generations; (c) Input costs vary
    with number of generations. Fig. 6(a) shows the location of wetlands corresponding
    to the Pareto optimal solutions. This is the spatial distribution of 1708 Pareto
    optimal solutions (Each Pareto optimal solution represents 84 ha wetlands), where
    most of the Pareto optimal solutions correspond to most wetland locations that
    are similar or overlapped. >70% of the wetlands are in farmland areas near rivers,
    while others are in grassland near rivers. There are many wetlands located near
    the recycled water pipelines, which satisfies the purpose that some of the wetlands
    in the planned wetlands will be used to treat recycled water that does not reach
    water of IV standard. The wetlands in the Fig. 6(a) (1–3) area can avert the polluted
    stormwater runoff passing through farmland areas, preventing it from flowing into
    urban rivers. The wetlands in the Fig. 6(a) (4–7) area can treat the polluted
    stormwater runoff before it flows out of the city. Download : Download high-res

    the two objectives. Fig. 7(a) shows the correlation between increased constructed
    wetland potential and increased input costs. If the input costs are high, this
    model will select the expensive grassland near the river with a higher constructed
    wetland potential as the wetland location. Fig. 7(b) reveals the connection between
    decreased TN mass removal and increasing input costs. If input costs fall, this
    model will choose less expensive farmland areas as wetland locations. However,
    as the TN load of this area is high, the TN mass removal will also be higher.
    Fig. 7(c) shows the trade-off between constructed wetland potential and TN removal.
    If the constructed wetland potential is higher, this model will choose the grassland
    with a low TN load near the river as wetlands. Download : Download high-res image

    wetlands scheme. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure
    legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) In this paper,
    the input costs were calculated by the cost of land prices, construction cost,
    and O&M cost. These calculations show more accuracy than calculating only the
    cost of land purchase(Singh et al., 2019), or construction cost and O&M cost (She
    et al., 2021; Yang and Best, 2015). The construction cost refers to the wetland
    construction cost of Sponge City in Beijing, which may lead to overestimation
    of the construction cost, as the material cost and labor cost in Shangqiu are
    lower than that in Beijing. The TN mass removal (4.1–5.9 g/m2/year) is a little
    higher than the average Nr (reactive nitrogen) mass removal (4.4 g/m2/year) of
    palustrine emergent (including constructed wetlands) in the United States (Jordan
    et al., 2011). This is because the TN removal in this study (before wetland construction)
    added the TN load (0.1–1.1 g/m2/year) of the original land use (before the wetlands
    was set up) at the site of the wetlands. The wetlands after construction will
    collect more of the first flush through the pipeline, which may remove more TN
    mass. The wetlands selected by this model have a high constructed wetland potential,
    and all wetland locations are within 300 m of water. 3.2. Comparison of Pareto
    optimal solutions and planned wetlands Table 3 reveals the comparison of Pareto
    optimal solutions and planned wetlands. Compared with the planned wetlands, the
    Pareto optimal solutions have better benefits in the constructed wetland potential,
    which can increase to 1.9% ∼ 25.1%; 82% of the Pareto optimal solutions, have
    high results in TN removal, and they can be increased to 30.8%; the input costs
    of the Pareto optimal solutions have superior benefits, and the input costs can
    be reduced by 8.9%–37.4%. Table 3. Comparison of Pareto optimal solutions and

    Front and the planned wetlands scheme. In comparison with the Pareto Front, the
    constructed wetland potential is lower than the minimum value of the Pareto Front,
    the TN mass removal is in the low-value area, and the input costs of the planned
    wetlands is much higher. Each scheme of the Pareto Front has a minimum of two
    objectives, better than the planned wetlands. Download : Download high-res image

    potential. The TN mass removal of the 84 ha wetlands were in the range of 3447
    to 4964 kg/year, which falls short of meeting the surface water of IV standard.
    This deficiency arises because when only wetlands are employed to treat the majority
    of stormwater runoff (90%) from urban, the wetlands area must constitute at least
    1–2% of the entire watershed (NRCS, 2001), whereas the wetlands area in this study
    accounted for merely 0.2% of the study area. Consequently, to a larger volume
    of stormwater runoff to be treated, the wetlands area or other stormwater management
    facilities needs to be expanded, such as rain garden, sunken green space, green
    roof, grass swale, detention pond, etc.(Yin et al., 2021). 3.3. Proposed wetlands
    optimization schemes Fig. 6(b-e) shows our four proposed wetland schemes. Fig.
    6(b) shows the highest economic benefit scheme for constructed wetland potential,
    which allows for the highest constructed wetland potential with the minimum input
    costs. Fig. 6(c) shows highest economic benefit scheme for pollutant removal,
    which allows for maximum pollutant removal with minimum input cost. Fig. 6(d)
    shows the scheme that is the best compromise of the three objectives at a statistical
    level. Fig. 6(e) shows the scheme with the highest constructed wetland potential,
    which is also the closest one to the planned wetland. Most of the schemes with
    higher economic benefits are situated in agricultural fields. The scheme with
    best compromise between three objectives and the scheme with highest constructed
    wetland potential are more evenly distributed spatially and has more wetlands
    in the riverside greenbelt. Table 4 shows the values of the proposed wetlands
    optimization schemes and the comparison of the proposed and the planned wetlands
    scheme. The four proposed wetlands optimization schemes are superior to the planned
    wetlands scheme. While the highest constructed wetland potential scheme has a
    smaller TN mass removal than the planned wetland, the other two objectives were
    better than the planned wetland. Compared to the planned wetland, the constructed
    wetland potential can be improved by 2.2% ∼ 25.1%; TN mass removal can be improved
    by −8.8% ∼28.0%; input costs can be reduced by 8.9% ∼ 37.1%. Table 4. Proposed
    wetland optimization schemes. Wetland location scheme Constructed wetland potential(unitless)

    25.1% −8.8% ∼28.0% −37.1% ∼ −8.9% Many wetland locations in the proposed schemes
    are comparable to the planned wetlands (Fig. 6(b-f)), providing evidence of the
    reliability of our model. Moreover, these schemes are further optimized at three
    objectives (constructed wetland potential, TN mass removal and input costs) compared
    to planned wetlands (Table 4). In the proposed wetlands optimization schemes,
    the nearby but disconnected wetlands can be combined with the surrounding planned
    green spaces to build urban wetland parks for leisure, entertainment, and purification
    functions. The Pareto optimal solutions represent an optimal solution set, offering
    various options to meet the diverse needs of decision-makers. When facing budget
    constraints, we recommend decision-makers to prioritize schemes with higher economic
    efficiency (Fig. 6(b-c)). In cases where decision-makers have no specific preferences,
    the most appropriate scheme (Fig. 6(d)) can be selected through quantitative analysis
    methods (Taboada and Coit, 2007; Zheng et al., 2017). If wetlands are required
    to simultaneously perform purification functions, provide recreational spaces,
    and support educational functions, we suggest decision-makers choose the scheme
    with the highest constructed wetland potential (Fig. 6(e)). This is because a
    higher constructed wetland potential enables wetlands to better withstand disturbances
    from human activities. Additionally, some of the wetlands in the scheme with the
    highest constructed wetland potential are situated in riverside green spaces in
    urban centers, providing easy access for public activities. Apart from these four
    proposed schemes, decision-makers can also consider other schemes based on specific
    circumstances, such as schemes with the lowest input costs or the highest TN mass
    removal, among others. If decision-makers want to assign different weighted values
    to each objective or adjust the weighted value, they can also use the Pareto optimal
    solution set to obtain the optimal scheme through the weighted calculation of
    each objective. In a word, these Pareto optimal solutions can provide a theoretical
    basis for decision-makers, intuitively display the characteristics of each scheme,
    provide a variety of results for decision-makers, and meet the requirements of
    those who choose one, or parts, of the solution from the Pareto front according
    to their preferences or different situations(Ma et al., 2010; Wang and Tong, 2009).
    4. Conclusions In this paper, a multi-objective optimization model was developed
    for spatial optimization of wetlands and was applied to a case study in Shangqiu
    City. The model''s aim was to effectively search for optimal wetland areas within
    the boundaries of the entire city by optimizing three objectives at the same time
    (maximizing constructed wetland potential, maximizing the TN mass removal and
    minimizing input costs). The results of this study verified that, even if there
    is no pre-selected potential wetland in the city, the model can also select an
    effective wetland site (Pareto optimal solutions). With the four proposed wetland
    schemes, the constructed wetland potential and TN removal can be greatly improved
    (2% ~ 25%; − 9% ~ 28%, respectively) and the cost can be greatly reduced (9% ~
    37%) compared to the planned wetlands. Furthermore, this model can provide decision-makers
    with a variety of optimal alternatives for wetland planning even when considering
    multiple objectives with trade-offs. By analyzing the correlations between the
    objectives, this model can provide decision-makers with an objective, quantitative,
    and visual basis for wetland site selection. By applying a heuristic multi-objective
    optimization algorithm, NSGA-II, the model developed in this study, optimizes
    the multiple benefits of wetlands simultaneously as well as improving the efficiency
    of urban land use by evaluating the suitability of wetland restoration. This model
    can be expanded to be used for different cities of all spatial scales, given the
    data availability, while the objective setting (total wetlands area to be selected),
    constraints and objectives (maximizing flood reduction, improvement of urban thermal
    environment and urban ecological axis connection) can be adjusted according to
    various planning regulations and decision-maker preferences. CRediT authorship

    IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction It Is well known that agriculture
    and animal husbandry are the world''s oldest and most widespread industries, and
    wireless sensor network (WSN) technology has become one of the latest technologies
    in animal husbandry [1]. By carrying sensors on livestock, livestock sensor networks
    (LSNs) can be used to sense the physiological condition and environment of livestock.
    Therefore, the LSN has become an essential and popular direction for WSN development
    [2]. By sensing pasture conditions using LSNs, the livestock industry can identify
    health problems, improve livestock production, and reduce production cost losses
    faster. However, the application of sensor technology in the livestock industry
    introduces various challenges to the practical implementation of the LSN [3].
    These challenges impede the widespread adoption of wireless sensor technology
    in livestock farms and hinder the practicality of the LSN [4]. In the LSN, all
    sensor nodes have limited energy, making it very difficult to replenish and replace
    the batteries. Therefore, reducing the energy loss of sensor nodes is an important
    way to extend the life of the LSN [5]. Clustering is considered a popular technique
    to reduce the system''s energy consumption by selecting the cluster head (CH)
    allocation scheme in the sensor nodes [6], [7]. An excellent CH allocation scheme
    can reduce the energy loss of the nodes during the data transmission phase, which
    results in more efficient system energy usage [8]. Since sensor nodes are mounted
    on animals in animal husbandry, sensor nodes in the LSN have the characteristic
    of random movement. In the LSN, sensor nodes are connected to animals, which can
    randomly move from one location to the next [9]. In this network, the base station
    (BS) selects a suitable CH for the system and, thus, forms a clustering scheme.
    Since the energy of sensor nodes in the system decreases with data sensing and
    transmission, and the nodes have the characteristic of random movement, the clustering
    scheme is dynamic in real time. Several emerging swarm intelligence optimization
    algorithms have gained attention in recent years. Among them, prairie dog optimization
    (PDO) [10] stands out for its remarkable global convergence speed. However, there
    is still a need to explore the development of multiobjective variants of PDO,
    enhance its performance, and investigate its hybridization with other algorithms
    to further improve its capabilities in solving complex engineering problems. In
    addition, the study has identified Aquila optimizer (AO) [11] as a promising optimization
    algorithm known for its fast convergence. However, it is crucial to consider the
    incorporation of other evolutionary operators to enhance the performance of AO
    and expand its applicability to a wider range of optimization problems. Because
    of the livestock industry''s requirements for data volume and loss rate, the system
    needs to be able to provide stable data transmission routes [12]. However, the
    existing LSN transmission protocols are usually CH to deliver data information
    directly to the BS or through multihops [13]. Usually, the direct transmission
    of information by CH increases the energy consumption burden of nodes and, thus,
    reduces the system''s lifetime. In the context of multihop data transmission,
    many systems rely on the random selection of the next hop target. However, this
    approach often proves inadequate in establishing stable and timely data transmission
    paths, resulting in heightened energy consumption of nodes and difficulties in
    managing distance variations caused by random node movements [14]. In a real animal
    husbandry environment, the LSN needs stable data transmission volume and a low
    packet loss rate to ensure real-time monitoring of animal husbandry. However,
    finding the optimal route for multihop data transmission is considered an NP-hard
    problem [15]. Therefore, heuristic algorithms are often used to solve the problem
    of selecting the best route for data transmission. The comprehensive investigation
    conducted on the cutting-edge swarm intelligence optimization algorithm, namely
    the dwarf mongoose optimization (DMO) [16], unequivocally demonstrates its remarkable
    capacity to enhance the convergence quality of local solutions, consequently yielding
    solutions of highly impressive quality. However, it is worth noting that the DMO
    does face a specific challenge in the form of convergence stagnation during the
    initialization phase, leading to a noticeable decrease in convergence speed. In
    order to tackle the obstacles encountered in WSNs within the livestock industry,
    this article introduces a pioneering methodology named Chaotic Adaptive Sparrow
    Search Optimization and Multiobjective Elite Ant Colony Search (CASSA-MEACS) algorithm.
    The purpose of CASSA-MEACS is to address the issues related to uneven clustering
    and unreasonable routing schemes in LSN operation, thereby improving energy efficiency,
    reducing packet loss, and extending the system lifespan. The authors'' contributions
    and novel facets in this article can be summarized as follows. A pioneering routing
    clustering methodology, denoted as CASSA-MEACS, is strategically developed to
    optimize clustering and routing configurations within the domain of LSN. This
    groundbreaking approach adeptly alleviates the detrimental impacts stemming from
    sensor node mobility, energy consumption, and data loss rates, all the while markedly
    augmenting the data transmission efficacy within the expansive realm of the LSN.
    A novel and precise network model for dynamic livestock movement is introduced,
    with the intent of mirroring the mobility of livestock sensors within the monitoring
    area. Furthermore, an inventive approach is introduced, integrating pivotal factors
    such as data packet loss rates and hotspot node probabilities into the routing
    determinations of LSNs. An ingenious routing clustering optimization tactics is
    introduced, encompassing a chaos-adaptive strategy and a multiobjective elite
    optimization strategy. These stratagems demonstrably elevate the overarching solution
    quality and adeptly surmount the challenge of premature convergence during local
    explorations. An entirely novel simulation experiment methodology that puts forth
    several innovative experimental metrics is introduced to evaluate the efficacy
    of CASSA-MEACS when contrasted with cutting-edge cluster-based routing algorithms.
    The performance of CASSA-MEACS is vividly depicted in contrast to three other
    algorithms. The experimental data undeniably illustrate that as the sensor network''s
    scale expands, our proposed CASSA-MEACS consistently surpasses other state-of-the-art
    algorithms in terms of quality of service (QoS). The experimental results provide
    compelling evidence of the effectiveness of CASSA-MEACS in achieving the stated
    objectives. The algorithm successfully extends the system lifespan, reduces energy
    consumption, improves system throughput, and achieves a substantial reduction
    in packet loss rate. By selecting optimal clustering and routing schemes, the
    proposed CASSA-MEACS algorithm plays a pivotal role in advancing LSN in the livestock
    industry. Its contributions are instrumental in enhancing the overall performance
    and efficiency of the LSN, leading to improved data transmission and operational
    capabilities. Article Organization: The rest of this article is organized as follows.
    Section II summarizes the current research on LSN clustering and routing methods
    and the research gaps. Section III describes the network model, the energy model,
    and the structural model. Section IV introduces the proposed CASSA-MEACS, which
    describes the three phases of LSN operation. Section V conducts simulation experiments
    and discusses the analysis of the results. Section VI concludes this article and
    analyzes the future research directions. SECTION II. Related Work In the LSN,
    wireless sensors can be installed on livestock and, thus, collect a large amount
    of data. In LSN research, the performance of LSN protocol algorithms is measured
    with QoS metric parameters. Since node energy consumption affects the lifetime
    of the system, it is often used as a universal QoS parameter in the literature
    [4]. Also, the packet loss rate and data transmission volume of sensor networks
    affect the quality of data information during transmission [17]. After continuous
    research on sensor technology, CH election and routing schemes have become popular
    research methods to improve the QoS. Currently, much research has been performed
    at home and abroad on CH selection and routing optimization problems [18]. Therefore,
    in Table I, we analyze and classify some of the current research works. TABLE
    I Meaning of Some Mathematical Symbols in Research In [19], a seagull-optimization-algorithm-based
    energy aware cluster routing protocol (SOA-EACR) was proposed to solve the problem
    of WSNs in animal husbandry. However, SOA-EACR converges too slowly in the process
    of selecting CHs. In [20], an energy-efficient cluster-based routing (EECBR) is
    proposed. EECBR can help unknown sensor nodes (SNs) to join the cluster by broadcasting
    their unique IDs and using grey wolf optimization (GWO) to optimize the CH election
    process. However, EECBR faces the challenge of load imbalance during the clustering
    phase. In [21], master particle swarm optimization (M-PSO) was proposed to guarantee
    the communication quality of routing in WSNs. M-PSO is an improved algorithm based
    on the PSO algorithm that can guarantee routing quality by selecting an additional
    CH and providing additional transport routes. However, the additional CH increases
    the energy loss of the system energy in the information transfer phase. In [22],
    multiobjective CH-based energy-aware optimized routing (MCH-EOR) was proposed
    to optimize the energy consumption problem for long-distance transmission in WSNs.
    However, the MCH-EOR solely focuses on sensor nodes in close proximity to the
    processing BS, neglecting the nodes situated farther away. As a consequence, the
    nodes located at a distance from the BS are more susceptible to depletion of their
    energy reserves, increasing the risk of their failure or premature shutdown. In
    [23], particle-water wave optimization (P-WWO) was proposed to solve the unreasonable
    CH selection problem existing in WSNs. P-WWO is an optimized routing scheme for
    security issues. It improves lifetime and load balancing. However, P-WWO has the
    problem of high system delay. In [24], the firefly algorithm and fruit-fly algorithm
    (FA-FFA) were proposed. However, in FA-FFA, nodes located far from the BS experience
    rapid energy consumption, leading to higher overall energy consumption in the
    system. It does not consider energy consumption during the previous round of communication.
    In [25], GWO-STF was proposed to solve the problem of excessive energy consumption
    in WSNs. However, it is important to note that the routing process of the GWO-STF
    algorithm may result in higher latency and necessitates careful consideration
    of the secure utilization of network data traffic. This article discusses and
    summarizes the viewpoints and limitations of the aforementioned literature research,
    as follows. Most of the optimization methods have great limitations for the problem
    of CH selection. The existing methods do not consider the influence of key factors
    such as the number of nodes adjacent to nodes, intracluster distance, and CH to
    other CH distance on LSNs. Most of the papers focus on the study of the CH selection
    process, and less attention is paid to the study of the real-time application
    of LSN and routing optimization to ensure stable data transmission. However, low
    latency and data volume are important requirements to ensure that the LSN can
    provide high-quality data transmission. Most papers focus on the CH selection
    process of LSNs, with less attention paid to the study of real-time applications
    of LSNs and routing optimization to ensure stable data transmission. However,
    low latency and data volume are important requirements to ensure that LSNs can
    provide high-quality data transmission. The impact of random sensor node movement
    on the clustering scheme and system routing optimization lacks attention in the
    articles mentioned above. Meanwhile, most of the existing studies are limited
    to optimization in terms of clustering or routing without considering the overall
    optimization impact. In the current advancement of the LSN, the optimization of
    energy consumption, system lifespan, data transmission quality, and system latency
    has emerged as a prominent research focus. To tackle these challenges, this article
    introduces CASSA-MEACS, a novel approach that aims to optimize clustering and
    routing schemes. The primary objectives of CASSA-MEACS are to achieve reduced
    energy consumption, extended system lifespan, and improved data transmission quality.
    By examining the latest research presented in this section, CASSA-MEACS demonstrates
    significant enhancements in solution convergence speed, prevention of evolutionary
    stagnation, and overall solution quality.When compared to other contemporary research
    algorithms outlined in Table II, the proposed CASSA-MEACS effectively optimizes
    clustering and routing in the LSN, thereby facilitating the development and implementation
    of LSN systems in the livestock industry. The numerical symbols used in this article
    are shown in Table I. TABLE II Analysis of Existing Studies SECTION III. Model
    Description In this section, the node random movement model, the structural model,
    and the energy consumption model of the LSN are introduced in detail. By carefully
    analyzing the real demand of livestock industry and livestock movement, this article
    proposes a new LSN structure model and energy consumption model for accurately
    describing the operation of the LSN. These models can accurately and realistically
    reflect the nodes'' movement in the LSN, nodes'' information transmission and
    nodes'' energy consumption, and other experimental data indicators. Since the
    sensor nodes are attached to the animals in the LSN, the deployment of these nodes
    has a stochastic dynamic nature. To ensure the maximum BS sensing range, the BSs
    are fixed at the center of the network monitoring area. According to the characteristics
    of the LSN, this article innovatively proposes a new network structure model,
    which possesses the following structural features. The BS is located in the center
    of the LSN monitoring area with a fixed location and has an unlimited energy supply.
    At the same time, the BS has a powerful ability to process information and send
    messages to every node in the network. Each sensor node has a unique ID and has
    the property of random motion. To preliminarily address the security aspect of
    the LSN, encryption of ID names is considered for the nodes. All sensor nodes
    are considered to be homogeneous, having the same initial energy and the same
    ability to process information. Therefore, in the CH election phase, each sensor
    node may be selected to be a CH. In the LSN, CMs within the cluster are responsible
    for collecting environmental, activity, and physical data of livestock to send
    to the cluster CH. Subsequently, the CH integrates the data to transmit data to
    the BS according to the optimal route generated by the algorithm. The transmission
    energy consumption of sensor nodes is automatically adjusted according to the
    transmission distance, which is a tunable range. In addition, during the data
    transmission and reception processes, encryption and decryption mechanisms are
    employed to ensure a certain level of security for the routing. A. Random Movement
    Model In this article, the livestock movement is considered as a random location
    movement, which causes the random movement of the sensor nodes. Therefore, this
    article pioneers the idea that the random movement of sensor nodes in the LSN
    conforms to the random wandering model. The random wandering model is represented
    as P t (x,y)= P t−1 (x+d(i),y+d(i)). (1) View Source In a stochastic motion model
    within a 2-D space, the spatial position of livestock can be represented as the
    coordinates of a point on a 2-D plane. The locomotion of the livestock is governed
    by random choices or decisions, resulting in unpredictable movement patterns.
    At each discrete time step, the object or individual selects its direction of
    movement from among four options: upward, downward, leftward, and rightward. Each
    direction is associated with specific probabilities, determining the likelihood
    of the object or individual moving in that particular direction. The movement
    step length of an object or individual during each time step is denoted by d ,
    which signifies the distance covered in each movement, as indicated in the following
    equation: d(i)=κ×( 1 σ× 2×π − − − − √ )× e (i−δ) 2 2× σ 2 . (2) View Source In
    the case of livestock, the movement step length follows a normal distribution,
    with the mean denoted as υ and the standard deviation as σ . The probability density
    function of the normal distribution can be utilized to express the mathematical
    formula governing the random movement step lengths. Within this formula, d(i)
    represents the probability density value associated with a specific step length
    i , while e denotes the base of the natural logarithm. The variable κ represents
    the random direction variable, which can assume values of − 1, 0, or 1. This variable
    is employed to determine the movement direction of the object at each time step.
    B. Network Structure Model An unsupervised LSN consists of N sensors installed
    on livestock herds to monitor the data periodically. The sensor nodes of the LSN
    operate in two modes: information gathering mode and data transmission mode. In
    the information collection mode, the sensor node collects physical information
    from its surroundings. In the data transmission mode of the sensor node, the clustering
    member (CM) transmits the information to the CH, which fuses the data and transmits
    it to the BS according to the routing scheme. After the sensor nodes are deployed,
    the LSN is left unattended. C. Energy Model The basic sensor energy model determines
    the network energy consumption. The following equation represents the energy consumption:
    E TX (b,d(x,y))=b× E elec +b×λ×d(x,y ) α (3) View Source where E TX is expressed
    as the transmitted energy consumed by the b -bit data volume at x and y distances
    and E elec represents the energy required for the activation of the b -bit data
    circuit. The energy model of CASSA-MEACS is shown in Fig. 1. The sensor is modeled
    with a free-space channel when the sending distance is less than the threshold
    distance. When the sensor sends information at a distance greater than the threshold
    distance, the multipath energy model is used. The following equation is expressed
    as the calculation method of the threshold distance: d 0 = ε fs ε mp − − − − √
    (4) View Source where ε fs and ε mp represent the required amplification energy
    in free space. Similarly, E RX is used to represent the energy consumed to receive
    the b -bit data volume at the x versus y position distance. The following equation
    is expressed as the calculation of E RX : E RX (b,d(x,y))=b× E elec . (5) View
    Source Therefore, E SR represents the energy consumption of the node in processing
    b -bit data in transmitting and receiving, as follows: E SR = E TX + E RX . (6)
    View Source Since CH is responsible for data aggregation and transmission, CH
    also needs to consume energy in data aggregation. The amount of energy consumption
    for CH summary b -bit data is shown as E DA =b× E pDp (7) View Source where E
    pDp is the energy consumption of b -bit data fusion. Therefore, E CH notes the
    energy consumption of CH, as shown in (8). Meanwhile, E CM is denoted as the energy
    consumption of CM, as shown in (9). E CH E CM = E SR + E DA = E SR (8) (9) View

    article, CASSA-MEACS is proposed to provide an optimal CH solution and routing
    scheme for the LSN, which can effectively reduce the system energy loss, extend
    the system lifetime, and provide high-quality data transmission. CASSA-MEACS is
    used for the whole process of three phases of LSN (see Fig. 2). Among them, CASSA
    is used in the CH selection phase of the LSN to reduce the overall energy consumption
    of the system. MEACS optimized routing, on the other hand, is applied to the routing
    phase of the LSN, which can achieve the optimal path for data transmission. In
    the LSN, CASSA-MEACS is used repeatedly until all nodes die or the network collapses.
    Fig. 2. Three stages of the LSN. Show All A. Initialization Phase During the initialization
    phase of the LSN, the network parameters of the system are processed in the BS.
    These parameters include physical information such as network coverage, number
    of clusters, etc. The BS performs the clustering and routing operations according
    to the phase of system operation. B. Clustering Phase The first objective in this
    phase is to select an optimal clustering scheme among all the sensor nodes. The
    optimal node is selected as CH in the objective function using the CASSA algorithm.
    The CASSA algorithm with the objective function of the relatively optimal clustering
    scheme is discussed in the following sections. 1) Objective Function CASSA aims
    to select the optimal CH solution with reduced energy consumption and thus extend
    system life. To achieve this purpose, this article proposes a novel objective
    function for CH selection. The objective function fully considers the node distance
    from BS, node energy, node priority, and node adjacency. The objective function
    is shown in the following equations: F= W= λ 1 f 1 + λ 2 f 2 + λ 3 f 3 + λ 4 f
    4 ∑ i=1 4 λ i ⋯⋯0< λ i <1. (10) (11) View Source To achieve effective optimization,
    λ 1 , λ 2 , λ 3 , and λ 4 represent the target weight coefficients satisfying
    W = 1. The analysis of the objective function is as follows. The following equation
    represents the ratio of the distances from different nodes to the BS: f 1 = ∑
    N CH i=1 d( N i ,BS) ∑ N k=1 d( N k ,BS) . (12) View Source Here, the numerator
    in f 1 is represented as the sum of the distances from CH nodes to the BS, while
    the denominator of f 1 is represented as the sum of the distances from all nodes
    to BS. Since distance is an important factor affecting energy transmission, selecting
    nodes close to the BS as CH can effectively reduce the energy consumption over
    the transmission distance. Algorithm 1: Main Procedure of CASSA-MEACS. The following
    equation represents the relationship between the energy changes of CM nodes in
    different phases of system operation: f 2 = ∑ i=1 N CM E trans (i) E sum (13)
    View Source where f 2 represents the relationship between the ratio of the energy
    consumed by all CM nodes in the transmission phase and the total energy consumed
    by the system, E trans represents the energy consumed by node i during the transmission
    phase, and E sum represents the total energy consumed by the system. The less
    energy consumed by the CM nodes in the transmission phase represents a reasonable
    CH selection, which can effectively extend the system lifetime. In the following
    equation f 3 = N live Rounds (14) View Source f 3 indicates the relationship between
    the number of running rounds of the system and the number of surviving nodes of
    the sensor and N live indicates the nodes that are currently alive in the system.
    When the number of sensor surviving nodes is higher, it indicates that the system
    is surviving for a longer period of time. The clustering scheme with more surviving
    nodes is more likely to be the optimal clustering scheme. The following equation
    represents the relationship between the number of neighboring nodes of a CH node
    and the surviving sensor nodes of the system: f 4 = ∑ N CH i=1 N i neib ∑ N live
    k=1 N k (15) View Source where N i neib is denoted as the number of neighbor nodes
    of the CH. The closeness of clustering affects the efficiency of information transmission.
    2) CASSA in Clustering In this section, the CH selection in the LSN is inspired
    by CASSA. Through the heuristic algorithm, this method can greatly optimize the
    CH selection scheme. CASSA is a new heuristic optimization algorithm, which is
    mainly inspired by the foraging and antipredation behaviors of sparrows. The algorithm
    mainly simulates the foraging process of sparrow flocks and has the advantages
    of strong merit-seeking ability and fast convergence speed. In the foraging process,
    the sparrow flock is divided into two types. The sparrow that finds food better
    is the discoverer. At the same time, the remaining sparrows in the flock act as
    followers. At the same time, a certain percentage of sparrows in the sparrow flock
    is selected to scout for early warning. To accurately represent the change of
    sparrow position, a new binarized CASSA is proposed in this article. We use the
    Sigmoidal (S-shaped) transfer function to apply a continuous compressed solution
    in each dimension, which force the sparrow to move in the binary search space.
    Therefore, a new matrix is proposed below to represent the change in the sparrow''s
    position S( x T+1 i,j ) X = 1 1+ exp − x T+1 i,j = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ x 11 ⋮ x m1 ⋯ x ij
    ⋯ x 1n ⋮ x mn ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ (16) (17) View Source where m denotes the number of sparrows
    and n is the number of sensors. As shown in (17), x ij = 1 represents the CH node,
    while 0 represents the CM node. For example, x ij = 1 means that the j th sensor
    in the i th sparrow (solution) is selected as the CH node x T+1 i,j ={ 0, 1, if
    υ<S( x T+1 i,j ) if υ>S( x T+1 i,j ) . (18) View Source The probability of updating
    the position vector value increases with the slope of the transfer function, which
    is then converted to a binary value using a random threshold υ . The conversion
    formula used in this article is as in (18). In CASSA, producers (the top 20% of
    the population in terms of objective function value among sparrows) are given
    priority in the search for food. During the search for the optimal solution, the
    producer takes charge of the global search and directs the movement of the entire
    population. The producer location update formula is as follows: x T+1 i,j ={ x
    T i,j ×exp( −i α×ite r max ) x T i,j +Q×L, R 2 ≥ST , R 2 <ST (19) View Source
    where T denotes the current number of iterations, x T i,j denotes the value of
    the j th node of the i th sparrow at the t th iteration, ite r max denotes the
    maximum number of iterations set by the algorithm, α∈ (0.1] is a random number,
    Q is a random number satisfying a normal distribution, and L is a 1 × d matrix
    with all elements in it being 1. R 2 ( R 2 ∈ [0,1]) is a uniform random number
    and ST ( ST∈ [0.5,1.0]) denotes the alarm value and the safety threshold, respectively.
    In CASSA, the remaining sparrows follow the producer as followers in the search
    process responsible for the local search. The formula for updating the position
    of the searcher is shown as x T+1 i,j = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ Q×exp( x T worst − x T i,j i 2 ),i>
    m 2 x T+1 P + ∣ ∣ x T i,j − x T+1 P ∣ ∣ × A + ×L,otherwise (20) View Source where
    x T worst is denoted as the worst position in the global, x T+1 P is denoted as
    the optimal position of the producer, and A denotes a 1 × d matrix where each
    element value is as follows: A + = A T (A A T ) −1 . (21) View Source CASSA selects
    some (10–20%) of the sparrows to be on guard during the sparrow flock foraging.
    There is a certain random probability that the sparrow flock move to a new location.
    The updated formula for the CASSA sparrow alerting mechanism is shown as x T+1
    i,j = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ x T best +β×( x T i,j − x T best ), x T i,j +K×( x T i,j − x T worst
    ( f i − f w )+ε ), f i ≠ f g f i = f g (22) View Source where x T best denotes
    the current global optimal position, β denotes the step control parameter, which
    is a normal distribution of random numbers with mean 0 and variance 1, K∈ [ −
    1, 1] is a random number, f i denotes the current sparrow''s fitness value, f
    g and f w are the current global best and worst fitness values, respectively,
    and ε is the smallest constant to avoid a denominator of 0. As shown in the formula,
    if the sparrow of this warning is in the current optimal position, it flees to
    a position near itself. This new position depends on the change of its own distance
    from the worst position and the worst food position. If the sparrow is not in
    the optimal position, it escapes to a position near the current optimal position.
    3) Chaotic Optimization Strategy A good initial population is important for the
    convergence accuracy and the resulting solution of the heuristic algorithm. In
    this article, the use of CASSA can effectively initialize a population of stochastic
    relations, thus improving the accuracy of the CH selection scheme. Due to the
    random expressiveness of chaos, this article innovatively proposes that using
    the core idea of chaos optimization can well solve the problem of population initialization
    of CASSA. At the same time, this article designs a new chaotic optimization formulation,
    which can obtain the initial population of chaotic optimization more quickly and,
    thus, greatly improve the optimization efficiency of the final clustering scheme.
    In this article, CASSA proposes an optimization formula for the initial sparrow
    population based on the idea of a chaotic optimization strategy of the logistic
    map as x T+1 i,j =α× x T i,j (1− x T+1 i,j ),0<α≤4. (23) View Source 4) Adaptive
    Operator The beginning phase of the existing heuristic algorithm iterates toward
    the global optimal position, so the search range of the LSN in the CH selection
    scheme receives a limitation. To overcome the above drawbacks, CASSA proposes
    a dynamic adaptive weighting strategy to update the position of sparrows. The
    producer positions are updated by weight coefficients. The producer position update
    formula is as follows: x T+1 i,j = x T i,j +δ×t(T)× x T i,j (24) View Source where
    t(T) is the t -distribution with the current number of iterations as degrees of
    freedom. The adaptive t -distribution variation strategy makes full use of the
    current population information. At the beginning of the iteration, the number
    of iterations is small and the t -distribution variation resembles the Cauchy
    distribution variation, which makes the algorithm have a strong global exploration
    capability. In the late iteration, the number of iterations is larger and the
    t -distribution variation resembles the Gaussian distribution variation, which
    makes the algorithm have a better local exploration ability. Although the introduction
    of the t -distribution strategy improves the algorithm''s optimization-seeking
    performance, it increases the computation time of the algorithm. Therefore, this
    article mirrors the use of the adaptive factor δ to control the t -distribution
    strategy. The adaptive factor δ is defined as follows: δ=1− T iter MAX −1 . (25)
    View Source Therefore, the CASSA pseudocode proposed in this article is shown
    in Algorithm 1. C. Routing Phase The LSN plays a crucial role in the livestock
    industry, where high-quality data transmission is essential. However, the LSN
    faces challenges such as unstable data transmission and low data transmission
    rates. To overcome these challenges, this article introduces an optimized routing
    scheme specifically designed for the LSN, aiming to enhance the quality of data
    transmission. In the subsequent section, this article will delve into the discussion
    of the adaptive function MEACS, which is an integral part of the system''s routing
    optimization. Algorithm 2: Main Procedure of CASSA-MEACS 1) Fitness Function In
    order to better reflect the demand for high-quality routing in LSNs, this article
    proposes a novel fitness function. In nature, ants randomly search from the initial
    location to the endpoint during the search process. In the information transmission
    process of the LSN, system delay, energy consumption, and the possibility of nodes
    becoming hotspots are all factors that measure the level of system QoS. Therefore,
    our proposed fitness function is a weighted multiobjective fitness function that
    measures the above three factors. In distinguishing between good and bad routing
    solutions found by the ant colony, a lower value of the fitness function represents
    a better routing solution. The fitness function is shown as D= α 1 × f sd + α
    2 × f ecp + α 3 × f pbh α 1 + α 2 + α 3 =1 (26) (27) View Source where f sd denotes
    the total system delay of the route. The system delay of system data transmission
    in the network can be calculated as f sd = ∑ i=1 N r delay(i) (28) View Source
    where delay(i) denotes the system delay on link i . f ecp is the routing energy
    consumption function. The function of routing scheme consumption is as follows:
    f ecp = ∑ i=1 N r ecp(i) (29) View Source where ecp(i) denotes the energy consumption
    on link i . f pbh denotes the probability function that a node may become a hot
    node during the transmission of this link. The higher the probability that a node
    may become a hotspot on the link, the less reliable the link is. f pbh can be
    calculated as f pbh = ∑ i=1 N r dd(i). (30) View Source 2) MEACS in Routing In
    the ant colony algorithm, the choice of ants for paths and the update of pheromones
    are two important factors that affect optimization. In the ant colony algorithm,
    each ant releases a certain amount of pheromone during the search process. In
    the pheromone update model, three models usually exist for ant algorithms: Ant-Cycle
    model, Ant-Quantity model, and Ant-Density model. In this article, Ant-Cycle is
    chosen as the pheromone update model. The pheromone is updated only after the
    ants have finished the path search. In order to optimize the pheromone update,
    this article uses an elite strategy algorithm to be able to find a better solution
    at an early stage. The pheromone update formula is as follows: τ i,j (gen+1) Δ
    τ i,j τ m i,j φ i,j Δ τ elite i,j = τ i,j (gen)×(1−ρ)+Δ τ i,j +Δ τ elite i,j =
    ∑ k=1 M Δ τ k i,j =PH× φ i,j = 1 D i,j =PH×υ (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) View Source
    where gen denotes the current number of iterations, M is the number of ants, ρ
    denotes the pheromone volatility factor, D i,j denotes the matrix for calculating
    the distance from node i to j , τ i,j denotes the increase for the pheromone on
    the network, PH represents the predetermined constant for the pheromone, φ i,j
    denotes the visibility of the ants, and v denotes the additional pheromone factor.
    D. Avoid Time Dealt and Packet Loss In the realm of LSNs, a multipath transmission
    mechanism is judiciously employed to bestow upon us an elevated QoS and a commensurate
    reduction in data packet loss. This sophisticated mechanism bestows data packets
    with the ability to navigate an array of routes toward their predetermined destinations,
    thus conferring heightened reliability and resilience upon the transmission of
    data packets. This mechanism is equally effective in curbing conflicts through
    the transmission of data via CH nodes. Moreover, to streamline the allocation
    of resources toward avoidance management, LSNs harness the efficiency of Huffman
    coding for data compression. These algorithms undertake a pivotal role in effecting
    a substantial reduction in data volume. Finally, a notable facet of this study
    is the introduction of a pioneering fitness function, expounded upon in (10) and
    (26). This function takes into account both the temporal aspect of data handling
    and the incidence of packet loss. By meticulously selecting the optimal path characterized
    by reduced time and a diminished packet loss rate, it efficaciously circumvents
    situations characterized by time-handling predicaments and packet loss. The sensor
    nodes elucidated in this article employ energy-conserving transmission strategies,
    incorporating low-power sleep and wake-up methodologies, to extend node longevity
    and curtail energy expenditure. Furthermore, the innovative multipath transmission
    mechanism and the application of Huffman coding serve to diminish the volume of
    transmitted data and compress the information prior to transmission, consequently
    augmenting the available bandwidth. E. Complexity Analysis The computational complexity
    of the proposed CASSA-MEACS method is primarily determined by the CASSA and MEACS
    algorithms. The maximum computational complexity of both CASSA and MEACS depends
    on factors such as the number of sensor nodes, population size, and the number
    of iterations. Therefore, their time complexity can be represented as CASSA−MEACS=
    N× D CASSA × G CASSA +N× G MEACS ×M. (36) View Source The energy-efficient hybrid
    clustering and hierarchical routing (EEHCHR) protocol, an amalgamation of clustering
    and hierarchical routing, is subject to the influence of the energy clustering
    strategy and the magnitude of the network, thereby impacting its temporal intricacy.
    The following equation elegantly encapsulates the comprehensive temporal complexity
    of the energy-efficient hybrid clustering and hierarchical routing (EEHCHR) protocol:
    EECHR=N× I EECH +N× I HR . (37) View Source The SOA-EACR approach exhibits a moderate
    to high level of temporal intricacy when confronted with extensive networks and
    intricate problem domains. Its temporal complexity primarily relies on factors
    such as the population size and number of iterations in the SOA phase, as well
    as the network size and CH selection stage in EACR. Thus, the time complexity
    of the SOA-EACR method can be succinctly captured as follows: SOA−EACR= I SOA
    ×N× D SOA +N×K×T. (38) View Source The temporal complexity of the particle swarm
    optimization for load balancing and evolutionary game theory (PSOLB-EGT) approach
    primarily stems from its constituent components, namely PSO and EGT, and can be
    succinctly described by (39). In this context, the symbol NBS represents the threshold
    value for the number of nodes other than the BS, while ψ denotes the proportional
    coefficient relating the comparison time to the data scale. CT signifies the comparison
    time, as illustrated in (40), while LT represents the learning time for each particle,
    as delineated in (41) PSOLB−EGT= CT= LT= NBS× I PSO × D PSO +NBS×(CT+LT) ψ×NBS
    ψ×NBS× I EGT × D EGT . (39) (40) (41) View Source While it is true that the CASSA-MEACS
    algorithm exhibits a relatively higher time complexity compared to certain algorithms,
    the incorporation of adaptive fuzzy operators and multiobjective elitist optimization
    operators does not significantly amplify its computational intricacy. As a result,
    the computational complexity of CASSA-MEACS remains within a tolerable range.
    SECTION V. Simulation and Discussion This study demonstrates the practical applicability
    of CASSA-MEACS in the livestock industry through closely simulating real-world
    LSN applications. The experiment compares the performance of CASSA-MEACS with
    existing methods under the same scenario, aiming to evaluate its effectiveness
    and superiority in addressing the unique challenges of the LSN. By comparing its
    performance to the existing methods, this study aim to provide support for the
    practical application of CASSA-MEACS in the livestock industry. The chosen scenario
    is the first pasture in Kunyu, Xinjiang, estimated to cover an area of 9000 m2.
    The simulation was conducted using MATLAB 2015 on a computer equipped with a 2.30-GHz
    Intel Core processor and 16 GB of memory. The simulated area is 30 × 30 units,
    and the simulation experiment involves sheep equipped with wireless sensor nodes
    to collect crucial data such as body temperature and location. These sensor nodes
    efficiently gather and integrate data, which are transmitted to the BS through
    the LSN. The conducted simulation experiment showcases the outstanding performance
    of the CASSA-MEACS algorithm in various parameters such as system lifespan, energy
    consumption, data transmission, and system latency. The parameter settings for
    these experiments are provided in Table III. TABLE III Simulation Setting The
    proposed CASSA-MEACS algorithm is extensively compared with several existing methods,
    namely EEHCHR [26], SOA-EACR [19], and PSOLB-EGT [27], all of which address the
    same case study. The objective is to investigate the impact of different scales
    of the LSN on the algorithm''s performance. To achieve this, a robustness analysis
    of CASSA-MEACS is conducted, considering scenarios with 100, 200, and 300 nodes.
    This analysis aims to explore the algorithm''s resilience and effectiveness across
    varying network scales. A. System Lifetime The system lifetime indicates the number
    of rounds the LSN has been running in the monitored area. This indicates that
    if the system lifetime is longer, then the longer the LSN is monitoring. During
    the operation of the LSN, the sensor nodes become dead nodes because of the depletion
    of their own energy. The measure of sensor network lifetime can be summarized
    as the number of rounds in which the first node dies (FND), the number of rounds
    in which half of the nodes die (HND), and the number of rounds in which all nodes
    die (AND). In Fig. 3, the use of CASSA-MEACS is effective in extending the system
    lifetime when the sensor nodes are 100. Compared to the other three compared algorithms,
    the method proposed in this article runs for a longer time in the system. The
    performance of CASSA-MEACS is higher than the other three comparison algorithms
    in terms of FND, HND, and AND. Among them, the FND of CASSA-MEACS is 483, which
    has 337, 318, and 131 more rounds than EEHCHR, SOA-EACR, and PSOLB-EGT, respectively.
    The HND of CASSA-MEACS is 1437 rounds, which is 21.15%, 16.21%, and 7.37% more
    than EEHCHR, SOA-EACR, and PSOLB-EGT, respectively. The AND of CASSA-MEACS is
    1923, which has 239, 120, and 84 more rounds than EEHCHR, SOA-EACR, and PSOLB-EGT,
    respectively . Fig. 3. FND, HND, and AND when the number of nodes is 100. Show
    All In Figs. 6 and 7, the use of CASSA-MEACS performs well in the middle and late
    stages of the system run (after 1000 rounds). After the sensor size increases,
    the system duration decreases accordingly for all four algorithms. As indicated
    in Figs. 4 and 8, CASSA-MEACS has a slower upward trend of dead nodes than the
    other three algorithms throughout the entire phase of the system run. This indicates
    that CASSA-MEACS has more FND, HND, and AND than all other three algorithms. This
    indicates that CASSA-MEACS has a longer overall time of system operation. CASSA-MEACS
    is better in system lifetime performance compared to the other three latest algorithms.

    of dead nodes in the system when the number of nodes is 300. Show All B. System
    Energy During sensor node operation, energy varies with the collection and transmission
    of information. The trend of the residual energy of the system can indicate the
    energy consumption of the system during operation and, thus, verify the algorithm''s
    merit. More residual energy in the system means that the system is more active
    in monitoring. A monitoring system with more residual energy means that the sensor
    nodes have more energy to focus on data acquisition and transmission. In Fig.
    9, with 100 sensor nodes, CASSA-MEACS ensures a lower residual energy downward
    trend of the system than the other three algorithms. At the early stage of the
    system operation (250 rounds), CASSA-MEACS has 3.46, 9.95, and 2.35 J more system
    residual energy than EEHCHR, SOA-EACR, and PSOLB-EGT, respectively. At the middle
    stage of the system operation (1000 rounds), CASSA-MEACS has 10.79, 5.95, and
    2.35 J more system residual energy than EEHCHR, SOA-EACR, and PSOLB-EGT, respectively.
    Similarly, at the later stage of the system operation, CASSA-MEACS has a higher
    residual energy than the other three algorithms. This proves that CASSA-MEACS
    is better than the other three compared algorithms in reducing the system energy
    loss. Fig. 9. Total energy of the system when the number of nodes is 100. Show
    All At the same time, as the sensor size increases, the energy decrease trend
    of CASSA-MEACS is slower than the other three algorithms. It can be seen from
    Figs. 10 and 11 that the CASSA-MEACS proposed in this article has higher residual
    energy in the whole process of the system than the other three algorithms. This
    proves that CASSA-MEACS has more accurate global convergence accuracy and faster
    local convergence speed compared with the other three compared algorithms, which
    can effectively reduce the consumption of residual energy of the system. Fig.
    10. Total energy of the system when the number of nodes is 200. Show All Fig.
    11. Total energy of the system when the number of nodes is 300. Show All C. Throughput
    The amount of data transmitted by the system is a crucial metric for measuring
    system routing. A stable routing scheme can transmit more packets for the system.
    In this article, the routing performance of CASSA-MEACS is analyzed with three
    other recent algorithms. In Fig. 12, with 100 sensor nodes, the total system transmission
    of CASSA-MEACS is 25.11%%, 51.26%, and 45.73% more than EEHCHR, SOA-EACR, and
    PSOLB-EGT, respectively. This indicates that the CASSA-MEACS proposed in this
    article avoids the rapid death of nodes and provides a more stable routing scheme.
    As the sensor size increases, the optimal route selected by CASSA-MEACS is higher
    than the other three algorithms in increasing the system data transmission. In
    Figs. 13 and 14, CASSA-MEACS still maintains more stable data transmission volume.
    The experimental results show that the CASSA-MEACS proposed in this article is
    better than the other three latest compared algorithms in ensuring the quality
    of routing data transmission. Fig. 12. Throughput of the system when the number

    is 300. Show All D. System Latency System latency is an important metric for high-quality
    QoS. Low latency allows data to be transmitted from the sensor node to the BS
    faster. The lower system latency can ensure that the system is more accurate and
    rapid for livestock monitoring. Therefore, lower system latency means better QoS
    of the system. In Fig. 15, the system delay of CASSA-MEACS is 4.24 ms for 100
    sensor nodes, which is 1.19, 2.75, and 3.41 ms lower than that of EEHCHR, SOA-EACR,
    and PSOLB-EGT, respectively. This indicates that CASSA-MEACS fully considers the
    data transmission distance factor in selecting the routing scheme, and the elite
    selection strategy can quickly find the optimal routing scheme. Fig. 15. System
    delay when the number of nodes is 100. Show All As the system sensor size increases,
    the system latency varies accordingly. In Fig. 16, the system latency of CASSA-MEACS
    is lower than that of EEHCHR, SOA-EACR, and PSOLB-EGT by 0.29, 1.53, and 0.72
    ms for 200 sensor nodes, respectively. CASSA-MEACS is still able to be lower than
    the other three algorithms after the number of sensors increases. Similarly, as
    shown in Fig. 17, when the number of system sensor nodes is increased to 300,
    the system latency of CASSA-MEACS is lower than that of EEHCHR, SOA-EACR, and
    PSOLB-EGT by 0.43, 1.30, and 2.59 ms, respectively. This shows that CASSA-MEACS
    can effectively reduce the system latency. Even when the sensor size increases,
    CASSA-MEACS still maintains good information transmission. Fig. 16. System delay
    when the number of nodes is 200. Show All Fig. 17. System delay when the number
    of nodes is 300. Show All E. Results Analysis In summation, after a meticulous
    examination of four pivotal experimental metrics, this investigation culminates
    in the determination that CASSA-MEACS showcases exemplary prowess in the realm
    of cluster-based routing optimization for the LSN, vis-à-vis the other three contemporary
    comparative algorithms. This substantiates that CASSA-MEACS imparts a discernible
    and meaningful contribution to the progression of the livestock industry, effectively
    catalyzing the real-world implementation of the LSN. SECTION VI. Conclusion The
    provision of energy efficiency and high QoS poses significant challenges in the
    development of LSN. This research article proposes an innovative approach, namely
    CASSA-MEACS, to effectively address the issues of high energy consumption, short
    system lifespan, high latency, and low system throughput in the LSN. Through extensive
    simulation experiments, this article introduces the pioneering CASSA-MEACS routing
    protocol and a novel livestock mobility model, offering a scholarly perspective
    on tackling specific challenges in the livestock industry. By analyzing the simulation
    results, it is evident that the proposed CASSA-MEACS algorithm surpasses three
    other state-of-the-art algorithms across various key parameters, including system
    lifespan, energy consumption, data transfer volume, and system latency. However,
    it is essential to acknowledge the limitations of this research, one of which
    pertains to the absence of consideration for security issues in LSN routing. In
    our future work, we are committed to addressing the security concerns in CASSA-MEACS
    comprehensively. Given that unreliable sensor nodes in the LSN can result in system
    stagnation or premature failures, our objective is to tackle this challenge by
    enhancing the security aspect, thus ensuring the reliability and integrity of
    the network. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More Like This Routing

  description: An automatic drip irrigation system (ADIS) based on the LoRa protocol
    was developed and then evaluated in a corn field. The system is composed of an
    irrigation cloud platform, a base station, wireless nodes, soil moisture sensors
    and solenoid valves. The system was installed in a corn field and tested for the
    maximum communication distance during the sowing stage without a canopy. In addition,
    the wireless node power consumption and communication stability of the system
    on different corn growth stages were also tested. The data collected from the
    cornfield showed that maximum stable communication distance between the base station
    and the nodes was up to 1300 m at sowing stage without canopy obstructions. Although
    the average packet loss rate was about 10% at a distance of 1000 m when the maximum
    of crop’s leaf area index was reached at corn mature stage, the automatic drip
    system still could run successfully by means of three retransmissions in signal
    management. Besides, with a polling period of longer than 10 min, the lifetime
    of valve control node which was powered by a 6000 mA·h lithium battery could cover
    whole growth period of corn. In conclusion, the comprehensive irrigation performance
    of the ADIS reveals that the developed automatic drip irrigation system based
    on soil moisture feedback can meet the irrigation control requirements and irrigate
    the corn periodically with the appropriate amount.

    2021 1 Introduction With advancements in sensor and communication technology,
    researchers have introduced modern techniques to water-saving irrigation and designed
    different types of automatic irrigation systems [1,2,3] These systems are divided
    into three groups based on data transmission measures: multi-line, two-line decoder
    and wireless system. The first two groups require wire lines in the fields, making
    them vulnerable to be damaged by agricultural machinery and difficult to install
    and maintain. The wireless irrigation control system (WICS) uses radio frequency
    (RF) waves to deliver signals, providing more flexibility in topological design,
    easier installation and less interference to agricultural machinery. Thus, wireless
    systems are widely used in agricultural irrigation [4,5,6]. Communication distance
    is a top concern for WICS to function properly. If a node is beyond the signal
    transmission range of the base station, the irrigation block controlled by the
    node would miss irrigation time, resulting in reduced production or even total
    crop failure. Most of the currently WICS use ZigBee or WiFi protocols operating
    at 2.4 GHz frequency, which have a relatively short communication range [7, 8].
    Therefore, multi-hop routing is usually used to extend communication distance,
    but resulting in increased power consumption and reduced lifetime of nodes network.
    In this paper, a new WICS based on the LoRa protocol operating at 433 MHz frequency
    was designed to get a longer communication distance and lower energy consumption.
    The system can make irrigation decision based on soil moisture and also allows
    users to control valves and check soil moisture data through the irrigation management
    cloud platform. During the corn growth period, the maximum radio communication
    distance, the effect of corn canopy development on the stability of the wireless
    irrigation system and the lifetime of radio nodes powered by battery were also
    investigated to verify the feasibility of the designed WICS for automated irrigation.
    2 Related work This section discusses methods to increase wireless sensor node
    transmission distance and obstacle-crossing ability. It analyzes the advantages
    and disadvantages of each method. Wireless sensor networks have been widely used
    in agriculture, specifically automated drip irrigation systems. Pawan proposed
    a wireless soil sensor network to monitor farmland and helped farmers make better
    management decisions [9]. In [10] the author introduced the application state
    of wireless sensor networks in apple orchards in India. To expand radio sensor
    node''s transmission distance, measures used in those existing research can mainly
    be divided into two categories: multi-hop routing to build an Ad-hoc network and
    using new transport protocol with long-range and low-power consumption without
    Ad-hoc networks [11, 12]. However, the multi-hop routing method can cause packet
    and power loss in nodes, negatively impacting transmission stability [13,14,15,16].
    In order to solve this problem, Agarkhed proposed a method to make data transmission
    between nodes and base station stable with limited energy by selecting routing
    nodes based on residual energy, delay and data transmission flow [17]. The application
    result showed that the method is effective. In addition, Deepakraj proposed an
    efficient routing protocol with an optimized mathematical model-Markov Chain Optimization
    Model [18]. The model could optimize the transmission path of data packets in
    the node network and reduce node energy consumption. Sharma proposed a method
    for adjusting the transmission frequency of node data packets based on the load,
    minimizing the energy consumption of the node network [19]. Kurumbanshi designed
    a new routing protocol that selects the path with the highest energy efficiency
    for data transmission by calculating the remaining energy of nodes in all routing
    paths from nodes to the base station [20]. The existing method using a new multi-hop
    routing protocol to reduce the overall network power consumption generally has
    the problem that routing nodes will periodically switch between adjacent nodes,
    causing additional energy consumption. To address this, some researchers established
    a new efficient geographic routing protocol based on the goal of minimizing the
    total energy consumption of data transmission in the routing path, effectively
    reducing the overall energy consumption of the system [21]. However, the means
    of multi-hop routing in Ad-hoc networks were not scalable since the increase of
    communication distance is still limited [22]. Hence, the fields require a large
    number of nodes to be covered, which not only leads to an increase in system costs
    but also interferes with the operation of agricultural machinery. In recent years,
    some researchers have also improved the transmission distance of wireless nodes
    by using new transport protocol with long-range and low-power consumption without
    Ad-hoc networks. LoRa (Long Range radio) is a promising choice since some studies
    have shown that it has the characteristics of long communication distance, high
    penetrability and low power consumption [23,24,25,26]. In [27], the author described
    an intelligent irrigation system that used a data fusion model and LoRa protocol
    network to predict irrigation demand and control electromagnetic valves for irrigation.
    Compared to manual setting solutions, it achieved an average water-saving efficiency
    of 94.74%. Zhang et al. developed a wireless irrigation system for cotton fields
    using the LoRa protocol. They created a mathematical model of irrigation for different
    stages of cotton on a computer control platform [28]. The system extended the
    transmission distance of wireless nodes and realized the intelligentization of
    the irrigation system. In [29], the authors made an automated irrigation system
    with LoRa and tested its transmission with obstructions. They found that it is
    good for large-scale urban irrigation, saves up to 23% water, and can be used
    in remote areas. In [30], the authors created a wastewater purification system
    for irrigation. It used electronic devices installed in different areas, including
    remote ones without mobile communication networks. The devices used the LoRa protocol
    to transmit data. Research showed that LoRaWAN could transmit data up to 5 km
    under ideal condition without any interference from circumstance. However, wireless
    irrigation systems in farm field may have signal obstruction from crops such as
    corn which has high plant height and large canopy. Long distance may also impact
    the acceptance rate of important commands such as on–off valves. And there is
    a lack of research on LoRa-base automatic irrigation system under the circumtances
    of crop canopy in the farm field. Based on these considerations, an LoRa comunication
    automated irrigation system was designed, fabricated and then tested in a large
    corn field in this paper. 3 Proposed work The automatic drip irrigation system
    (ADIS) has four main parts: wireless data collector node, wireless valve control
    node, base station and irrigation cloud platform. And it is divided into platform-level
    and field-level as shown in Fig. 1. The wireless data collection node collected
    data from the soil moisture sensor (TEROS 11, Meter Group Incorporated) and the
    wireless valve control node controlled the solenoid valve (IrriRich DSF DN80,
    Ningbo Yaofeng Hydraulic Electrics Co.,Ltd). Management of sensors and valves,
    as well as the transfer of any data was fulfilled over LoRa communication between
    the base station and the nodes. Further, the base station and the irrigation cloud
    platform were employed as a field-level network controller and data center respectively.
    The base station plays a crucial role in the ADIS by connecting the nodes in irrigation
    field with the cloud platform. Management of sensors and valves, as well as the
    transfer of any data was fulfilled over LoRa communication between the base station
    and the nodes. The base station delivers soil moisture and other relevant information
    to the platform for interpretation and analysis, and receives commands from the
    platform to control the valves in the field by the General Packet Radio Service
    (GPRS). Thus the base station is responsible for the conversion of the two different
    communication protocols. Fig. 1 Operation scheme of the ADIS Full size image The
    base station and the wireless nodes in the fields adopt star topology, which means
    no intermediate node is necessary for relaying or routing, reducing latency in
    data transfer. This result in a simple and stable operation due to LoRa''s spread
    spectrum transmission technology, which has long-range transmission and strong
    obstacle immunity. There are two types of wireless nodes in ADIS: the collector
    node and the valve control node. The microprocessor in the collector node collects
    soil moisture data and transmits it to the base station via LoRa protocol. The
    valve control node has two ports, one port are used to drive the solenoid valve
    and control the drip irrigation on/off, and the other port is used connect with
    a pulse flowmeter record water amout flow through the valve. In the ADIS, each
    node has a unique ID number, and the base station communicates with them in turn.
    If a node fails to respond, the base station sends a warning signal to the irrigation
    cloud platform and continue to poll the other nodes to collect all data. The number
    of nodes in each base station is limited to 63 in order to avoid long active polling
    times. To reduce power consumption, the base station issues a single instruction
    for a 3000 ms sleep–wake cycle, including a 2990 ms wake-up instruction and a
    10 ms on–off valve instruction, resulting in a duty ratio of 1/300. The node sends
    an acknowledgment to the base station when it receives the instructions. Furthermore,
    to sustain reliable communications, the node’s hardware is automatically initialized
    to troubleshoot any failure if a node fails to receive any instruction for two
    hours. Finally, we evaluate irrigation performance based on whether the equipment
    can irrigate when the soil water content drops to the lower limit and stop when
    it reaches the upper limit. See Fig. 2 for the flowchart of the field-level network.
    Fig. 2 Flowchart of Field-level network Full size image To enable users to manage
    ADIS and control irrigation via a web browser on multiple client devices, the
    field-level network connects to the client through a private cloud platform (Fig.
    3). This cloud platform, which is built on a laboratory server, is accessible
    only by ADIS and allows for customization of resources to meet specific requirements.
    Fig.3 Irrigation cloud platform interface Full size image The irrigation cloud
    platform is developed based on the PaaS (Platform as a Service) model from AliYun
    (Alibaba Group''s cloud computing brand), where the supplier sets up the infrastructure
    and developers create the application layer for irrigation management. It communicates
    with the base station by GPRS through TCP/IP protocol. It manages on-site equipment,
    receives information, stores and analyzes data. The application layer has five
    modules: node management, data collection, irrigation management, data display
    and alarm prompt. The application layer structure of the cloud platform is shown
    in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 Structure of the cloud platform managing the irrigation Full
    size image When the irrigation management cloud platform receives soil moisture
    data, its function module checks if the soil moisture content reaches the irrigation
    threshold set by the program. If the content is below the limit, the controller
    records and stores the data locally. Generally, 2 or 3 collector nodes and a valve
    control node are installed in an irrigated block. If the soil water content collected
    by one of the collector nodes exceeds the preset limit, the platform sends instructions
    to the irrigation controller to open the solenoid valve and send the individual
    irrigation amount (q) to this node. The water balance equation given below is
    used to determine the irrigation amount, \\(q\\): $$\\mathrm{q}=({\\uptheta }_{\\mathrm{upper}}-{\\uptheta
    }_{\\mathrm{lower}})\\mathrm{Ah}.$$ (1) In Eq. 1, \\(\\mathrm{A}\\) refers to
    the irrigation area which is irrigated by a valve control node, \\({\\uptheta
    }_{\\mathrm{upper}}\\) refers to the upper limit of soil water content (90–100%
    of the field capacity (FC), and in this work it was selected as 95% of FC), \\({\\uptheta
    }_{\\mathrm{lower}}\\) refers to the lower limit of water content, and h refers
    to irrigation wetting depth. In the experiments, 20 cm–100 cm was selected based
    on the different growth stages. The tester determined the growth period based
    on the corn condition and set the limits of soil moisture content and irrigation
    wetting layer on the cloud platform. Finally, the proposed irrigation system''s
    performance was tested over two consecutive years (2018 and 2019) in cornfields
    at the Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Science and Technology Demonstration Park
    (43°37''N, 122°16''E) in the north part of China. Rainfall during the growth period
    in 2018 and 2019 (from late April to early September) were 339 mm and 424 mm respectively.
    The experimental area mainly has sandy clay loam which characteristic parameters
    are shown in Table 1. The experimental data were analyzed by using the SPSS (Statistical
    Product and Service Solutions, V22.0) software. Table 1 Soil characteristics in
    the experimental area Full size table The experiment started at corn sowing stage
    and ended at ripeness stage. The test area had a planting density of 60,000 corn
    plants per hectare. The base station antenna was 3 m high and the wireless node
    antenna was 1.5 m high. The maximum communication distance test varied the distance
    from nodes to the base station from 300 to 1500 m. For every 50 m of radial increase
    in distance, a node was installed without obstruction except for corn (Fig. 5).
    The base station and nodes exchanged six groups of 500 data packets daily, for
    a total of 3,000 packets. During the experiment, the effect of corn canopy at
    different stages on ADIS wireless signal transmission quality was analyzed by
    calculating packet loss rate and received signal strength indicator (RSSI). The
    packet loss rate and RSSI were calculated by querying the number of packets received
    by the base station and nodes and the value of RSSI of the nodes and base station
    in dBm. Both the base station and node had a transmitting power of 20 dBm, and
    the receiving sensitivity of the RF chip was -148 dBm. In theory, when RSSI falls
    below the sensitivity of the RF chip, communication between the base station and
    nodes will fail. Fig. 5 Range test setup Full size image To test the comprehensive
    irrigation performance of ADIS, 15 nodes were ranged from 55 to 306 m away from
    the base station, buried 20 cm below the surface. The installation positions were
    shown in Fig. 6. Each drip irrigation plot had one tube and two rows, with wide-narrow
    row planting. The narrow rows were 40 cm wide and 80 cm apart due to the wider
    rows. The drip irrigation tube was placed in the middle of the narrow rows. Fig.
    6 ADIS comprehensive irrigation performance test layout Full size image 4 Results
    and performance evaluation of the ADIS 4.1 Maximum communication distance of the
    ADIS The stability of the system is directly impacted by the transmission distance
    between the base station and nodes. Field obstacles, such as houses, trees and
    crop canopy, have negative effect on wireless transmission [31,32,33]. To analyse
    the effect of the crop plant height and canopy on the operation performance of
    the ADIS, the corn plant height and leaf area index (LAI), which is an crucial
    indictor reflecting the canopy growth, were measured every 10 days (see Figs.
    7 and 8) during the test period. Fig. 7 Change of the plant height with time Full
    size image Fig. 8 Change of the LAI with time Full size image The plant height
    and LAI of corn plants from the first and 120th day were selected for graphs,
    were zero and the maximum value, respectively. Figures 9 and 10 show the changes
    of RSSI and packet loss rate between nodes and base stations. Distance negatively
    impacted RSSI (r = -0.991), and positively impacted packet loss rate (r = 0.972).
    The R2 value of the fitting coefficient is generally greater than 0.95. The base
    station''s antenna height is 3 m, which was much higher than the height of the
    node antenna, resulting in stronger power gain effect and less signal attenuation
    compared to nodes. Because of that, the reliability of the node transmitting signal
    (NTB) determines the communication stability of the system, so subsequent studies
    focused on node transmitting signals only. Fig. 9 RSSI as a function of communication
    distance. Note: NTB refers to the signals sent from nodes to the base station,
    and BTN refers to the signals sent from the base station to nodes. The fitting
    coefficients range from 0.9631 to 0.9935 Full size image Fig. 10 Packet loss rate
    as a function of communication distance. Note: NTB and BTN have the same meanings
    as the fitting coefficients range from 0.9559 to 0.9821 Full size image The ADIS
    had an acceptable packet loss rate of 10%. Regression analysis showed that as
    long as the communication distance was under 1300 m in, the packet loss rate was
    still within the accepted level. Over the two-year field test, the average packet
    loss rate was 9.6%. At this distance, the minimum reliable RSSI was -121.45 dBm
    and the reliable link margin (LM) was calculated to be 26.55 dBm using Eq. 2.
    When the crop canopy had the greatest influence, the same packet loss rate occurred
    at a communication distance of 1000 m, where the minimum reliable RSSI was -121.61
    dBm and the link margin was 26.39 dBm. The above experimental results show that,
    in order to ensure stable communication of the system during the whole growth
    period of corn, the maximum distance between the node and the base station should
    not exceed 1000 m. $$\\mathrm{LM}=\\mathrm{RSSI}-\\mathrm{RS}$$ (2) In Eq. 2,
    RSSI refers to the received signal strength indicator, and RS refers to the receiver
    sensitivity. Figures 11 and 12 show the changes of RSSI and packet loss rate with
    time of a node located 1000 m away from the base station. These figures demonstrate
    that when the corn plant reached a height greater than the node antenna (150 cm)
    about 70 days after sowing, wireless signal transmission was significantly impacted.
    Compared with the experimental results at the 60th day after sowing when the plant
    height was about 125 cm and lower than the antenna of the node, the packet loss
    rate increased by 14.1% on average and signal reception decreased by 4.5%. Therefore,
    the relative height between the plant and node antenna have significant effect
    on signal transmission and it is recommended that node antenna should be installed
    at a height greater than the mature crop plant height to ensure optimal signal
    transmission. Fig. 11 The RSSI over time Full size image Fig. 12 The packet loss
    rate over time Full size image In order to further ensure ADIS’s communication
    stability with crop shielding and reduce the power consumption, the node adopts
    the sleep–wake mechanism and wakes up 10 ms every 2990 m. In the wake state, the
    node detects whether there is a command sent by the base station, and sends a
    heartbeat packet when receiving the polling command. In consideration of base
    station’s sleep–wake cycle, irrigation control software uses the mechanism of
    three repeated supplementary transmissions to ensure delivery of control orders.
    If a node does not respond after three attempts, the irrigation control module
    alarms. This prompts the manager to repair the faulty node to ensure the irrigation
    system operates normally. Even if there is increased data packet loss rate due
    to corn canopy growth, proper software design can still maintain normal irrigation
    system operation. 4.2 Comprehensive irrigation performance of the ADIS To evaluate
    the performance of the ADIS, the reliability of the data transmission between
    nodes and the base stations, node power consumption in the whole corn growth period
    were recorded and anslyzed. The packet loss rate of the 15 nodes during the whole
    growth period is shown in Table 2, and the maximum packet loss rate is 0.75%,
    which almost has no effect on data transmission and even could be neglected. Figure

    Fig. 13 The valve control node actuation activities in whole growth period Full
    size image The comprehensive performance of ADIS showed that when the polling
    cycle of the valve control node was more than 10 min and that of the collector
    node was 2 h, and the number of network nodes was less than 63, the lifetime of
    nodes exceeded the corn’s growth period and a 3.6 V / 6000 mA·h lithium battery
    could meet the power supply requirements of the nodes. In terms of irrigation
    performance, ADIS determined the timing and quantity of irrigation without human
    intervention and had the ability to send commands to irrigate when the soil water
    content dropped to the lower limit during corn’s whole growth period. The irrigation
    quotas were 2130 m3/hm2 and 3150 m3/hm2, with yields of 12,160 kg/hm2 and 12,920
    kg/hm2. The proposed ADIS system eliminates the need for manual switching of the
    irrigation valve and minimizes the workforce required for irrigation management,
    making it more convenient and efficient. This advantage has been demonstrated
    in other studies related to automated irrigation systems [34, 35]. 5 Conclusions
    and discussion This paper describes a wireless automatic drip irrigation system
    (LoRa, 433 MHz) based on soil moisture content. It was tested in a corn field
    and achieved stable communication distances up to 1300 m in an open field. During
    the mature stage of the corn canopy, the LoRa communication data packet loss rate
    was about 10% with a distance between the base station and nodes below 1000 m.
    However, by using three repeated supplementary transmissions in signal management,
    the base station could still send instructions and control the solenoid valves
    successfully, even with a 10% packet loss rate. Compared to the existing ZigBee-based
    irrigation control system, the operation stability of the ADIS based on LoRa is
    significantly improved in open fields and complex circumstances with canopy interferences,
    which is consistent with the literature [36, 37]. Two years of continuous corn
    field experiments showed that ADIS based on the lower limit of soil water content
    irrigation could irrigate the farmland at the appropriate time to compensate for
    the lack of rainfall. By using a polling period of more than 10 min for the value
    control node, the wireless nodes of the system were equipped with merely a 3.6
    V/6000 mAh lithiumion battery could sustain continuous operation throughout the
    growth period of the corn (150 days). This battery-based solution enables relatively
    lower installation and operational costs in compared with deploying photovoltaic
    panels or establishing a wired power-supply infrastructure, which makes it the
    best fit for agricultural irrigation control. Future work will focus on the combination
    of the LoRa-based WICS and the other irrigation methods. Data availability The
    datasets generated during and analysed during the current study are not publicly
    available due to it will be used for the development of subsequent system, which

    Abstract Cascade reservoirs are essential in water resource utilization, flood
    control, and disaster mitigation. They have been built in several rivers worldwide.
    The rank classification for cascade reservoirs has significant practical implications
    for resource distribution decisions and risk management strategies and is also
    essential for ensuring the security of the basin. Internationally, reservoirs
    are typically classified based on project scale and dam failure consequences,
    whereas the risk transmission and superposition effect renders the classification
    method of reservoirs not directly applicable to cascade reservoirs. Therefore,
    to address this issue, this study proposed a rank classification method for cascade
    reservoirs. First, based on the scale, benefits, and risk consequences of dam
    failure, an index system for the rank classification of cascade reservoirs was
    established. Second, by constructing social risk criteria for cascade reservoirs
    and establishing a link among “project rank-reliability index-annual failure probability,”
    the allowable dam failure losses for different project ranks were determined.
    Thereafter, considering risk transmission and superposition, the rank classification
    standard and index quantification method for cascade reservoirs were proposed.
    Finally, five cascade reservoirs were selected for a feasibility study. The proposed
    method provides a supplement to the current rank classification standard of water

    inundationRisk transmissionRisk management 1. Introduction To utilize hydro energy
    resources, cascade development has been employed in several rivers worldwide,
    such as the Tennessee River in the United States, Yenisei River in Russia, Rhone
    River in France, Columbia River flowing through Canada and the United States,
    and Yangtze River and Yellow River in China (Bai et al., 2019, Latrubesse et al.,
    2017, Wang et al., 2023a). With the continuous development in construction technology
    and the growing demand for sustainable energy, the size of cascade reservoirs
    is also growing. This poses a significant challenge to the overall management
    of basins (Faucheux et al., 2022). Given the difference in scale, mission, and
    importance relative to the entire basin, there is an urgent need to study methods
    of rank classification for cascade reservoirs. This will allow for differential
    management and ensure the efficient distribution of limited resources (Wang et
    al., 2020). Most countries worldwide classify reservoir projects based on their
    geometry (reservoir capacity and dam height), consequences of dam failure, or
    a combination of both, implementing various standards for design, construction,
    and operational management (Ren et al., 2017, Sheng and Fu, 2010). Through dam
    classification, regulation responsibility is assigned to different agencies to
    realize differentiated management. In the operation stage, dams with the most
    serious risk consequences are given specific attention and are usually directly
    supervised by the government to ensure their safety, as shown in Fig. 1. Download

    Classification methods and objectives of reservoir projects. Recently, dam failures
    have occasionally occurred with global climate change and the frequent occurrence
    of extreme weather events (Wu et al., 2021, Zhang et al., 2021). Compared with
    those in individual reservoirs, the risks in cascade reservoirs have transmission
    and superposition effects. The failure of a single dam in a cascade reservoir
    system may have severe consequences, potentially leading to failures of downstream
    reservoirs (Wang et al., 2023a, Wang et al., 2023b, Mehta et al., 2020). With
    the rolling development of basins and the increased risk awareness of the public,
    the risk consequences of cascade reservoirs have become a public safety concern
    and should be considered in project rank classification. The rank classification
    of water and hydropower projects follows the laws of nature and economy, involving
    the comprehensive coordination of several aspects such as technology, economy,
    safety, environmental protection, navigation, and society (Sheng and Fu, 2010,
    Li et al., 2021). Table 1 lists the classification indexes used in several countries
    (Ren et al., 2017). Among these indexes, scale and effects are currently used
    as the primary bases for classifying water and hydropower projects in China. The
    reservoir projects are classified into five ranks (Ⅰ, Ⅱ, III, IV, and V) based
    on scale and benefits. The permanent hydraulic structures are classified into
    five grades (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) based on their importance and project rank (The
    Ministry of Water Resources of the People''s Republic of China, 2017). Table 1.

    benefits The classification methods in most countries are primarily intended for
    individual reservoirs and cannot be applied directly to cascade reservoirs. For
    instance, the current classification standard for water conservancy and hydropower
    projects in China states that the determination of project ranks and flood standards
    for cascade reservoirs should be subject to special analysis and demonstration
    (The Ministry of Water Resources of the People''s Republic of China, 2017). Currently,
    the management of reservoir dams is transiting from safety to risk management,
    and research results on the risk of individual dams are being applied in practical
    applications of engineering (Escuder-Bueno et al., 2016). Contrarily, the risk
    issues of cascade reservoirs are extremely challenging, and related studies are
    still in the initial stage (Wang et al., 2023a). Regarding risk quantification
    and classification of cascade reservoirs, Lima et al. (2022) adopted a simplified
    method considering dam height, storage capacity, and potential risk to classify
    small dams in a cascade basin in Brazil. Ghimire and Schulenberg (2022) conducted
    a failure risk analysis of two cascading dams in Michigan, and evaluated the impacts
    of climate change on earthen dams. Based on multi-objective evolutionary algorithms
    and risk analysis methods, Manikkuwahandi and Hornberger (2021) proposed the operation
    rules for cascade reservoirs to enhance hydropower and agriculture yield. Micovic
    et al. (2016) presented stochastic simulation of floods on a cascade system of
    three dams and analyzed the causes of the risk of dam overtopping. Dewals et al.
    (2011) simulated the flood propagation and inundation process of successive dam
    failures. Wang et al. (2022) presented a method to calculate the risk probabilities
    of cascade reservoirs. Zhou et al. (2015) initially investigated the safety standards
    for cascade reservoirs based on the risk analysis of successive dam failures.
    Wang et al. (2020) conducted a targeted analysis and demonstration on the selection
    of relevant parameters of risk criteria for cascade reservoirs in China. The aforementioned
    studies have considered the complexity of the risk in cascade reservoirs, and
    their results serve as valuable sources for risk prevention and control. However,
    most existing studies focus on the evaluation of risk levels and the severity
    of dam failure consequences and therefore cannot support the comprehensive issue
    of rank classification for cascade reservoirs. In addition, index selection, quantification,
    and implementation standard have not been unified and need to be adequately integrated
    with existing regulations (Wang et al., 2023a). Owing to the significance of water
    resources in social development and the consequences of dam failure, risk considerations
    should be incorporated into the rank classification of cascade reservoirs based
    on existing standards for general reservoirs. Therefore, this study proposed a
    rank classification method that comprehensively considered the project scale,
    benefits, and risk consequences of dam failure, providing a basis for the construction
    planning and risk management of cascade reservoirs. 2. Methods The rank classification
    method for cascade reservoirs proposed in this study primarily includes the selection,
    threshold value determination, and quantification of indexes. Among them, the
    selection of indexes is based on the synthesis of reservoir classification methods
    used in different countries. Quantification focuses on the analysis of risk transmission
    and superposition effect, which are the differences between cascade and individual
    reservoirs. These two aspects are common in different countries. In contrast,
    the index thresholds in the rank classification standard are dependent on the
    level of social development and the risk tolerance of the public, and thus may
    vary across different countries (Ge et al., 2017, Ren et al., 2017). The index
    thresholds in this study are determined based on a specific analysis of cascade
    reservoirs in China, serving as a demonstration. 2.1. Construction of the index
    system for the rank classification of cascade reservoirs As presented in Table
    1, most European and American countries, especially economically developed countries,
    use scale and dam failure consequences as the primary bases for classifying reservoir
    projects. The project scale reflects the technical challenges of construction
    to a certain extent, whereas the consequences of dam failure cover specific considerations
    of potential risks caused by dam failure and are an important basis for determining
    engineering design and operation management standards (Li et al., 2018). In addition,
    as an essential reference for the normal function of water and hydropower projects,
    comprehensive benefits reflect their contribution and importance in the development
    of the national economy and should also be used as one of the classification bases
    (Lu et al., 2018, Rashid et al., 2018). Therefore, the scale, benefits, and risk
    consequences of dam failure are selected as the bases for the rank classification
    of cascade reservoirs. Generally, the scale of a reservoir is reflected by two
    indexes: dam height and storage capacity. Notably, the project rank determined
    by dam height is lower than that determined by storage capacity, with the latter
    being more practical (Sheng and Fu, 2010). In addition, the risk consequences
    of dam failure have been listed separately as the bases for rank classification.
    Therefore, the storage capacity and dam height of a reservoir need not be combined
    to measure the severity of its dam failure. Regarding the current standard in
    China, the storage capacity is used as the scale index for rank classification
    (The Ministry of Water Resources of the People''s Republic of China, 2017). For
    the benefit indexes, cascade reservoirs primarily focus on disaster prevention
    and water resource conversion. The benefits of flood control and power generation
    are noticeable and are used as primary benefits indexes to classify project ranks
    (Lu et al., 2018, Zhou et al., 2014). Specifically, flood control benefits include
    protected population (permanent population in the flood control protected area),
    equivalent economic scale (the product of the per capita GDP index and protected
    population), and protected farmland area, whereas power generation benefits are
    reflected by the installed capacity (Sharifi et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2023a,
    Zhou et al., 2018). Risk consequences indexes are used to reflect and primarily
    classify the potential inundation losses caused by a cascade reservoir dam failure
    into two aspects: life and economy (Jonkman et al., 2010, Li et al., 2018). According
    to Table 1 and related literature (Ge et al., 2021, Ge et al., 2020a, Li et al.,
    2019a), both “Loss of life (LOL)” and “Population at risk (PAR)” can be used to
    quantify the impact of dam failure on life safety. In practical terms, LOL refers
    to the actual fatalities in the downstream area caused by a dam-break flood. It
    ignores the number of residents transferred and rescued in an emergency. (Ge et
    al., 2022, Zhu et al., 2021); PAR refers to all the population directly exposed
    to the flooded area. Notably, even if reservoir dam failure does not ultimately
    result in LOL, the emergency relocation and resettlement of PAR is often accompanied
    by a significant consumption of social resources and can have corresponding risk
    consequences. Therefore, PAR is selected in this study as an index to reflect
    the impact of a dam failure on the life safety of downstream residents. (Peng
    and Zhang, 2013). In addition, “Loss of economy”(LOE) is used to reflect the impact
    of dam failure on the national economy and represent the various types of losses
    directly measurable in monetary terms caused by a dam-break flood (Li et al.,
    2018, Zhu et al., 2020). Ultimately, PAR and LOE are selected as the secondary
    indexes of “Risk consequences.” Fig. 2 shows the index system for the rank classification
    of cascade reservoirs. Download : Download high-res image (253KB) Download : Download

    2.2. Determination of the index thresholds In addition to the index system, the
    determination of index thresholds corresponding to different project ranks is
    the key to constructing the rank classification standard. For a reservoir project,
    using extremely low index thresholds for classification will result in an extremely
    high project rank. Consequently, a considerable amount of human and financial
    resources needs to be invested to upgrade the required safety level to match the
    project rank, which is uneconomical (Li et al., 2019b, Lin et al., 2015). Conversely,
    using extremely high thresholds will lead to a low project rank, corresponding
    to a low-security requirement, and aggravates the risk borne by the downstream
    (Li et al., 2018). The classification of the project rank of reservoirs according
    to scale and benefits has achieved wide application in China and formed a complete
    system (Ren et al., 2017). Therefore, the index thresholds of scale and benefits
    shown in Fig. 2 can continue to follow the relevant provisions in existing standards.
    For the indexes of risk consequences, their thresholds must be determined by considering
    the level of national economic development and the risk tolerance of the public.
    Currently, the thresholds of PAR and LOE for different ranks of reservoir projects
    have not been defined in relevant technical standards. However, most countries
    and regions internationally reflect engineering safety through reliability indexes
    and have promulgated relevant technical standards, which specify the design service
    life and target reliability corresponding to different ranks of hydraulic structures
    (Hariri-Ardebili, 2018, Li et al., 2015a, McGuire and VandenBerge, 2017). Generally,
    the higher the project rank, the higher is the reliability indexes specified for
    the structures and the lower the failure probability. According to the reliability
    theory, if the random variables of a structure obey normal distributions and their
    limit state equations are linear, a correspondence exists between the reliability
    index β and failure probability Pf (Ge et al., 2017, Li et al., 2015a, Wilde and
    Johansson, 2013, Zhu and Tang, 2023), as shown in Fig. 3 and Eq. (1). (1) Download
    : Download high-res image (82KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Relationship
    between reliability index and failure probability. where Φ is the cumulative distribution
    function of standard normal distribution. When Z = 0, the Z = R-S is referred
    to as the limit state equation, where R and S are set in a linear relationship
    (Shao et al., 2020, Wilde and Johansson, 2013). It has been observed from monitoring
    data that a majority of random variable loads follow a normal or nearly normal
    distribution (Shao et al., 2020, Pereira et al., 2018, Wilde and Johansson, 2013).
    Notably, random variables that are not normally distributed can also be transformed
    to conform to a normal distribution by utilizing equivalent normalization or equal
    probability transformation (Shao et al., 2020). Therefore, the transformation
    between the reliability index and failure probability should be achieved based
    on the above-mentioned settings. Moreover, studies on this issue have been conducted
    systematically, presenting tables of mutual correspondence between reliability
    and failure probability in the relevant results and specifications (Hariri-Ardebili,
    2018, Li et al., 2015a, McGuire and VandenBerge, 2017). Accordingly, the allowable
    dam failure probability for reservoirs of different ranks can be defined by establishing
    a link among “project rank-reliability index-annual failure probability.” In addition,
    the social risk criteria for reservoir dams can effectively reflect the acceptable
    and tolerable consequences of dam failure for the public under different dam failure
    probabilities (Ge et al., 2017), whereby the thresholds of risk consequence indexes
    allowed for different ranks of reservoirs can be obtained, as shown in Fig. 4.

    Fig. 4. Determination of the index thresholds of risk consequences. 2.3. Formulation
    of social risk criteria for cascade reservoir dams As shown in Fig. 4, the formulation
    of the social risk criteria for cascade reservoir dams is crucial for determining
    the index thresholds of risk consequences. The social risk criteria reflect the
    relationship between the loss in a given accident and its probability of occurrence
    and can be used to determine the consequences allowed by the public for dam failures
    with different probabilities (Wang et al., 2020, Ge et al., 2017). Generally,
    the ALARP principle and F–N curves are used to construct social risk criteria.
    The ALARP principle (Li et al., 2015b) divides the risk into three regions, namely
    intolerable, tolerable (ALARP region), and acceptable regions, through the tolerable
    risk level (TRL) and acceptable risk level (ARL). The F–N curve (Wang et al.,
    2020) represents the relationship between the number of fatalities N and its exceeding
    probability Pf expressed using Eq. (2). (2) where FN(x) is the probability distribution
    function of the number of losses per annum, signifying the probability of less
    than × losses per annum, n is the steepness of the limit line, and C is the constant
    that determines the position of the limit line. Li et al. (2015b) proposed social
    life risk criteria for reservoir dams in China. The TRL started at 10-2 and achieved
    an extreme value of 10-6. The ARL started at 10-3 and achieved an extreme value
    of 10-7. Given that a dam failure in cascade reservoirs may trigger successive
    dam failures in its downstream, cascade reservoir dams should have more demanding
    risk criteria than individual reservoir dams. Specifically, for social risk criteria,
    the dam failure probability of a cascade reservoir should be lower than that specified
    for an individual reservoir, corresponding to the same dam failure losses. In
    our previous studies (Wang et al., 2023a, Wang et al., 2022), the total risk probability
    of a cascade reservoir dam was proposed to be equal to the sum of the weighted
    failure probabilities of its upstream dams and its failure probability. To ensure
    that the total risk probability of each dam in cascade reservoirs still satisfies
    the requirements of the social risk criteria for individual reservoir dams, the
    failure probability of a cascade reservoir dam should be one order of magnitude
    lower than that of an individual reservoir dam. Therefore, the TRL and ARL of
    cascade reservoir dams started at 10-3 and 10-4, with 10-7 and 10-8 as the extremes,
    respectively; n is taken as 2, which represents an adverse risk preference (Li
    et al., 2015b). By using Eq. (2), the LOL corresponding to the inflection point
    at the lowest point of both the TRL and ARL is 100 persons, as shown in Fig. 5(a).
    In addition, the economic risk criteria are constructed regarding the ratio of
    one person corresponding to an economic loss of RMB 4 million (Ge et al., 2020c,
    Li et al., 2015b, Wang et al., 2020), as shown in Fig. 5(b). Download : Download

    criteria for cascade reservoir dams: (a) Loss of life; (b) Loss of economy. As
    shown in Fig. 5, the relationships between the annual failure probability and
    the allowable consequences of cascade reservoir dams have been established. Based
    on these criteria, the loss threshold allowed by society under a certain dam failure
    probability can be obtained. 2.4. Calculation of thresholds based on social risk
    criteria and reliable indexes According to the structural safety grade, design
    service life, and target reliability of hydraulic structures at different grades
    specified in the Unified Standard for Reliability Design of Hydraulic Engineering
    Structures (GB50199-2013) in China, the allowable annual failure probabilities
    for different project ranks are calculated, as presented in Table 2. Notably,
    the annual failure probability in Table 2 is for individual reservoir dams, and
    the corresponding annual failure probability for cascade reservoir dams should
    also be reduced by one order of magnitude on this basis (Ge et al., 2020b, Li
    et al., 2015b). Considering the correspondence between the failure probability
    and acceptable losses in the social risk criteria, the critical values of the
    LOL corresponding to different failure probabilities are determined, as shown
    in Fig. 6. Table 2. Annual failure probability corresponding to different project
    ranks. Project rank Hydraulic structure grade Structure security grade Design

    Critical values of LOL corresponding to annual failure probabilities. Considering
    that the three threshold ranges shown in Fig. 6 are not sufficient for the classification
    of five project ranks, the accident classification standard in China is used as
    a reference to refine and divides the accident severity into four levels according
    to the LOL (Wang et al., 2020). Synthetically, the threshold values of the LOL
    corresponding to different project ranks are formulated. Among them, the failure
    of the Class V project corresponds to a general accident and the allowed LOL is
    less than three persons. The intervals of the LOL allowed for the other project
    ranks are sequentially extended and ensured to all following the upper limits
    allowed for each project rank in Fig. 6. In addition, the thresholds of LOE are
    determined on the ratio of one person responding to approximately RMB 4 million,
    as shown in Fig. 7. Download : Download high-res image (199KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 7. Thresholds of dam failure losses corresponding to different
    project ranks. The critical values of the PAR are determined according to its
    conversion relationship with the LOL, which can be established through the mortality
    rate of dam failure (Ge et al., 2022). Notably, the mortality rate f is closely
    related to flood severity, warning time, and public awareness of risk prevention,
    which are not invariable for different cases (Ge et al., 2021, Li et al., 2019a),
    as shown in Fig. 8. Therefore, the value of f is not specifically constrained
    but determined following the engineering reality in the specific application,
    as shown in Table 3. Download : Download high-res image (134KB) Download : Download

    [0, 12) In application, the PAR can often be rapidly quantified by combining the
    population density distribution and the simulated flood inundation range, whereas
    the LOL needs to be further deduced in combination with the mortality rate. Therefore,
    the PAR rather than the LOL should be used in the standard as a rank classification
    index from the perspective of promotion and application. 2.5. Risk consequences
    analysis and project rank classification of cascade reservoirs The risk transmission
    and superposition among cascade reservoirs are primarily reflected in that the
    failure probability of a cascade reservoir dam is affected by the upstream cascades.
    In addition, its failure has varying degrees of impact on downstream cascades
    (Wang et al., 2023b). Based on the impact scope of a cascade reservoir dam failure
    in its downstream area, risk consequences are decomposed into direct consequences
    (DC) and potential consequences (PC), as shown in Fig. 8. Considering the failure
    of dam M shown in Fig. 9 as an example, its inundation area is segmented, and
    LMN is the DC of dam M. Moreover, the failure of dam M has a certain probability
    to cause the successive dam failures of “M−N” and “M−N−K,” further expanding the
    inundation losses. Consequently, PCNK and PCK are the PC of dam M and are not
    directly equivalent to the segmented losses LNK and LK because of the probabilistic
    nature of successive dam failures. Download : Download high-res image (366KB)

    consequences in cascade reservoirs. In our previous studies (Wang et al., 2023a,
    Wang et al., 2022, Wang et al., 2023b), the degree of risk transmission and superposition
    among cascade reservoirs was reflected by the conditional probability (CP) of
    downstream dam failure under an upstream dam-break flood. Through sample simulation
    and statistics, the frequency of the downstream dam overtopping was determined
    and used as the value of the CP, as shown in Fig. 10. Subsequently, the calculation
    method for dam failure risk consequences of the cascade reservoir (considering
    dam M shown in Fig. 9 as an example) was proposed, where DC was equal to the product
    of the CP of successive dam failure and segmented loss, as shown in Eq. (3). (3)

    Fig. 10. Calculation of the CP of successive dam failure. where CM is the total
    risk consequence of dam M, which primarily includes LOL, LOE, and environmental
    impact. Using the project scale, benefits, and risk consequences of dam failure,
    a standard for the rank classification of cascade reservoirs is constructed, as
    presented in Table 4. In application, the indexes of scale and benefits are quantified
    regarding the project parameters, which is the same as for individual reservoirs.
    The indexes of risk consequences are quantified using Eq. (3), which reflects
    the risk transmission and superposition in cascade reservoirs. For multipurpose
    projects in China, the highest rank is considered if the results determined by
    different types of indexes are different (Ren et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2023a).
    For projects in other countries, the three basic indexes should be assigned different
    weights depending on the national conditions or policy requirements. After classifying
    the project rank of the cascade reservoir, the grades of its permanent structures
    are also determined, as shown in Table 5. Table 4. Rank classification standard

    objects for rank classification. The basic overview of the projects is shown in
    Fig. 10 and Table 6 (Zhang et al., 2015, Zhang et al., 2008). The water levels
    in front of the dam during the operation period of the five reservoirs followed
    a normal distribution of (155, 2), (128, 1), (112, 0.8), (83, 0.8), and (53, 1.8),
    respectively (Tang et al., 2021). Considering the cascade reservoir dams as the
    boundaries, the study area is divided into five segments for targeted analysis,

    The scale and benefit indexes of each cascade reservoir were determined directly
    from the engineering parameters in Table 6, whereas the risk indexes were quantified
    through dam failure simulation and flood routing analysis. The capacity parameters
    indicated that the dam failure of the Dahua Reservoir will cause successive dam
    failures of the BLT, Letan, and QG reservoirs. Moreover, the dam failure of the
    BLT and Letan reservoirs will lead to the failures of their adjacent cascades
    downstream. Therefore, the corresponding CPs of successive dam failures under
    these scenarios were directly set as 1. Owing to its large storage capacity, we
    were uncertain whether the DTX reservoir would break under an upstream dam-break
    flood. According to Fig. 10, 10,000 groups of water level combinations under different
    dam failure scenarios are sampled in MATLAB for simulation (Wang et al., 2022,
    Wang et al., 2023b). The water level distributions in front of the DTX dam under
    different dam failure scenarios are shown in Fig. 13, and the corresponding conditional

    (Ge et al., 2022, Zelenakova et al., 2019). The inundation area under two dam
    failure scenarios is shown in Fig. 14. Given that the LOE of dam failure is related
    to the distribution of infrastructure such as factories, enterprises, and transportation
    arteries downstream (Ge et al., 2020c) and cannot easily be quantified precisely,
    only the PAR was employed in this study as an example of risk consequences. By
    definition, the product of the inundation area and corresponding population density
    was set as the value of PAR. Download : Download high-res image (571KB) Download

    In Section 2.5, the segmented losses of each cascade reservoir dam failure were
    classified as a DC and PC of the total risk consequences. Considering the Dahua
    reservoir, its dam failure initially caused a direct inundation of 13,197 persons
    in segment ①, which was a DC. Then, it caused the successive failures of the other
    four downstream reservoirs. The corresponding inundation in segments ②, ③, ④,
    and ⑤ were 4464, 24825, 113036, and 523,261 persons, respectively. Combined with
    the CP of each successive dam failure scenario, its PC was 324,734 persons: (1
    × 4464 + 1 × 1 × 24825 + 1 × 1 × 1 × 113036 + 1 × 1 × 1 × 0.3486 × 37884). Using
    Eq. (3), the PAR of each cascade reservoir is calculated, as shown in Table 8
    and Fig. 15. Table 8. Statistics of inundation population and risk consequences

    in Table 4, the mortality rate f must be specified for practical applications.
    Based on the dam failure statistics in China, Zhou et al. (2007) proposed a table
    for the prediction of the f of the PAR under different flood severity levels,
    warning times, and the risk awareness of the public. This table was adopted in
    this study. Using the results of the water depth, flow velocity, and evolution
    time of the dam-break flood simulated in the above-mentioned scenarios, f was
    determined to be 0.001. Subsequently, the critical values of the PAR for different
    project ranks of the cascade reservoirs presented in Table 4 are determined as
    87000, 30000, 10000, and 3000 persons. Regarding the engineering parameters and
    the calculation results of the PAR, the cascade reservoirs were classified according
    to scale, benefits, and risk consequences. Finally, their project ranks and the
    grades of the primary structures are determined according to the highest level,

    PAR of the selected cascade reservoirs in the Dadu River basin.(4) Rank classification
    of cascade reservoirs. Owing to the lack of social risk criteria and data from
    other countries, the selected case experiment is a group of cascade reservoirs
    located in China. Therefore, the standard in Table 3 can be used directly. For
    cascade reservoirs in other countries, additional steps are needed. For example,
    the threshold values of the LOL should be derived by applying the method in Section
    2.4 in combination with the social risk criteria of that country. Thus, the standard
    in Table 3 will be updated appropriately. Nevertheless, the primary methodology
    and process are still generalizable. According to the simulation results of the
    dam-break flood and the recommended table for the prediction of the mortality
    rate, f was determined as 0.003 in all the cases. Subsequently, the critical values
    of the PAR for different project ranks of the cascade reservoirs presented in
    Table 4 are set as 29000, 10000, 3333, and 1000 persons. Finally, the cascade
    reservoirs are classified, as shown in Fig. 19. Download : Download high-res image

    selected cascade reservoirs in the Dadu River basin. 4. Discussion (a) Fig. 16
    shows that if risk consequences are not considered, only the DTX reservoir will
    be a Class I project according to the scale and benefits, whereas the other four
    reservoirs will be Class II projects. Table 6 and Fig. 13 show that if risk transmission
    and superposition are not considered and only the DC is calculated as risk consequences,
    the direct PAR of the DTX reservoir will exceed 87,000 and its project rank will
    be Class I. The direct PARs of QG, Letan, BLT, and Dahua reservoirs will be in
    the range of 30000–87000, 10000–30000, 0–3000, and 10000–30000, and their project
    ranks will be Classes Ⅱ, III, V, and IV according to the risk consequences, respectively.
    In contrast, the project ranks and primary structure grades of the four upstream
    cascade reservoirs increased after adopting the rank classification method proposed
    in this study. (b) For projects with severe accident consequences, the current
    standard for rank classification of water and hydropower projects in China particularly
    stipulates that the grades of their primary structures should be raised by one
    level. Similarly, several existing studies (Zhou et al., 2015, Zhou et al., 2020)
    proposed that the project rank of a cascade reservoir that will cause dam failures
    downstream under effective early warning should be raised from the original one.
    These procedures are consistent with the aforementioned results of rank classification.
    Moreover, this study weighted the segmented losses caused by dam-break floods
    following the CPs of successive dam failures. Therefore, risk transmission and
    superposition effects were reflected, thus improving the rationality of the risk
    consequence assessment of cascade reservoirs. (c) In the current standards of
    China and other countries, the “Protected population” is considered one of the
    indexes of flood control benefits, representing the permanent population in downstream
    protected areas (Ge et al., 2022). However, it differs from the population that
    will be inundated by a dam-break flood and therefore cannot be used to quantify
    risk consequences. In contrast, the PAR directly represents the population exposed
    to the inundation area and can be determined through flood simulation. Most importantly,
    the thresholds of the PAR allowed for different project ranks can be determined
    by referencing the social risk criteria and the f of dam failure. Therefore, the
    PAR can be effectively used as an index of risk consequences in the rank classification
    of reservoir projects. (d) As f is closely related to flood severity, warning
    time, and the risk awareness of the public, its value is not specifically constrained
    in the rank classification standard proposed in this study. However, it is analyzed
    and quantified in engineering applications. Thus, the determination of the project
    rank is closely related to f, providing an incentive for reservoir management
    to identify and address risk. To avoid being classified as a high-rank project
    that requires high maintenance costs and limits the failure probability, f and
    LOE should be reduced by improving the emergency response plan and infrastructure
    layout (Ge et al., 2020c, Ge et al., 2022). Then, the project rank will be constrained
    to reduce its risk consequences. This method is consistent with the concept of
    dam risk management through a combination of engineering and non-engineering measures
    (Li et al., 2015a). (e) Although hydropower projects are built primarily to supply
    sustainable energy and generate socioeconomic benefits, the risk they pose to
    the downstream cannot be ignored (Pisaniello et al., 2012). Internationally, dam
    failure consequences are used as important bases for classifying reservoir projects
    and are thus scientific and effective procedures from the perspective of risk
    management. Currently, the universal applicability of classifying reservoirs in
    China based on dam failure consequences has yet to be further demonstrated, owing
    to the existing differences in the socio-economic development levels within developed
    countries. However, this remains a potential area for future research (Ren et
    al., 2017). Considering the severe consequences of successive dam failures, the
    risk concept should be applied to the rank classification of cascade reservoirs
    as a priority and gradually extended to general reservoirs. 5. Conclusions Cascade
    reservoirs have long spatial spans and present considerable management challenges
    as they run through the entire basin. To propose scientific and practical methods
    for the rank classification of cascade reservoirs, we conducted a series of studies
    and achieved the following results: (1) An index system for the rank classification
    of cascade reservoirs based on scale, benefit, and risk was constructed; (2) The
    critical values for the LOL allowed for different project ranks were formulated,
    and the thresholds of the PAR were further derived through the f of dam failure;
    (3) Risk transmission and superposition effects were quantified, and the calculation
    formula of the risk consequences of cascade reservoirs was proposed; (4) After
    applying the proposed method to five cascade reservoirs, the rank classification
    results were higher than those obtained using the current standard, thus validating
    the feasibility of the proposed method. Although cascade reservoirs in China were
    selected for specific analysis in the determination of index thresholds, the analytical
    model proposed in this study is also applicable to cascade reservoirs in other
    countries, especially the method of quantifying risk consequence indexes and the
    idea of determining the allowed thresholds through social risk criteria. In addition,
    the reasonable quantification of the f of the PAR is crucial for the determination
    of the project rank. This is briefly analyzed in this study based on existing
    results. In future studies, we will improve the practicality of the quantification
    method and the accuracy of the calculation results. CRediT authorship contribution

    2 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract After the Seveso disaster occurred more than
    40 years ago, there has been an increasing awareness of the potential impacts
    that similar accident events can occur in a wide range of process establishments,
    where the handling and production of hazardous substances pose a real threat to
    society and the environment. In these industrial sites denominated “Seveso sites,”
    the urgent need for an effective strategy emerged markedly to handle hazardous
    activities and to ensure safe conditions. Since then, the main challenging research
    issues have focused on how to prevent such accident events and how to mitigate
    their consequences leading to the development of many risk assessment methodologies.
    In recent years, researchers and practitioners have tried to provide useful overviews
    of the existing risk assessment methodologies proposing several reviews. However,
    these reviews are not exhaustive because they are either dated or focus only on
    one specific topic (e.g., liquefied natural gas, domino effect, etc.). This work
    aims to overcome the limitations of the current reviews by providing an up-to-date
    and comprehensive overview of the risk assessment methodologies for handling hazardous
    substances within the European industry. In particular, we have focused on the
    current techniques for hazards and accident scenarios identification, as well
    as probability and consequence analyses for both onshore and offshore installations.
    Thus, we have identified the research streams that have characterized the activities
    of researchers and practitioners over the years, and we have then presented and
    discussed the different risk assessment methodologies available concerning the
    research stream that they belong to. 1 INTRODUCTION Serious accidents from the
    past (e.g., Barthélémy et al., 2001; Health and Safety Executive, 2008; Heylin,
    1985; Homberger et al., 1979; Van Kamp et al., 2005; Vierendeels et al., 2011)
    have proved that the economic, political, and social consequences of accident
    events occurring at industrial sites handling, manufacturing, using, or storing
    dangerous substances can be enormous. Operators of onshore sites where hazardous
    substances are handled should take all the necessary measures to prevent major
    accidents, mitigate their consequences, and recover from them. Such establishments
    range from explosive storage facilities and fuel and gas depots to complex process
    industries. They are denominated “Seveso sites” (further categorized in lower-
    and upper-tier establishments) (Paltrinieri & Reniers, 2017). The directive defines
    hazardous substances and quantity thresholds for lower and upper tiers (European
    Parliament and Council, 2012). But, how did we arrive at the definition of a directive
    for the regulation of major chemical accident hazards at the EU level? The catastrophic
    accident that occurred in a chemical plant located in Seveso (Italy) in 1976 led
    to the urgent adoption of legislation on the prevention and control of such accidents.
    Therefore, the first industrial safety Directive, the so-called Seveso-Directive
    (Directive 82/501/EEC), was amended in 1982 and, subsequently, replaced first
    by Seveso-II (Directive 96/82/EC) and then by the current Seveso-III (Directive
    2012/18/EU) in 2012 aiming at providing a proper regulatory framework based on
    strategic process safety and risk management given the lessons learned from accidents
    occurred over time. It is worth mentioning that Seveso Directive is implemented
    and adopted through national legislation; nevertheless, each EU Member State may
    maintain or develop its regulations to strengthen its application. Pey et al.
    (2009) and Laurent et al. (2021) investigated the differences existing in applying
    different regulations highlighting the nonuniform approach to defining and assessing
    major hazards (methodologies, inspection practices, etc.) as well as the lack
    of coherent definition to establish thresholds for risk and/or consequence tolerance
    or acceptance. Therefore, efforts should be addressed on harmonizing legislation
    to ensure a uniform Europe-wide standard. If Seveso Directive deals specifically
    with onshore major accident hazards involving dangerous substances, the safety
    of the offshore oil and gas industry is, instead, regulated by parallel directives,
    such as the one establishing minimum requirements for preventing major accidents
    in offshore oil and gas operations and limiting the consequences of such accidents
    (European Council, 2013). The likelihood and the consequences of accidents can
    be reduced by appropriate risk management processes (Carpignano et al., 2009).
    As reported in the ISO 31000: 2018 (International Standard Organization (ISO),
    2018), a risk management process “involves the systematic application of policies,
    procedures, and practices to the activities of communicating and consulting, establishing
    the context and assessing, treating, monitoring, reviewing, recording and reporting
    risk.” Hence, a risk management process should dynamically pursue the aims of
    (i) identifying, analyzing, and assessing potential hazards in a system or related
    to an activity, and (ii) defining and introducing control measures to eliminate
    or reduce potential risks to people, assets, or the environment (Rausand & Haugen,
    2020). This process comprises four main phases, that is, risk assessment, risk
    treatment, risk communication, and risk monitoring and review. Specifically, the
    risk assessment phase is fundamental for the prevention of accident events and
    the mitigation of their consequences (Dunjó et al., 2010). The classic “triplet
    definition of risk” by Kaplan and Garrick (1981) states that risk can be expressed
    by what can go wrong (scenario), what likelihood it will have (probability), and
    how severe consequences will be (consequence). Thus, with “risk assessment,” we
    also refer to the techniques for identification of hazards and accident scenarios
    (e.g., hazard and operability study [HAZOP], failure mode and effect analysis
    [FMEA], or layers of protection analysis [LOPA]), probability, and consequence
    analyses, considering the term from a synecdochic perspective. To tackle these
    problems, a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approach is required; thus,
    methods and approaches are combined with knowledge from different disciplines
    and fields such as engineering, statistics, psychology, social sciences, medicine,
    and so forth (Society for Risk Analysis (SRA), 2018b). Hence, risk assessment
    is considered as a scientific field based on the combination of these methods
    and knowledge to: (i) develop risk principles and research aiming at conceptualizing,
    assessing, managing, communicating, and governing risk (Aven, 2016; Aven, 2018a;
    Society for Risk Analysis (SRA), 2018a) and (ii) study and treat the risk of specific
    activities (the design and operations of industrial sites, investment, natural
    phenomena, etc.) aiming at preventing accident events and mitigating their consequences
    (Christou & Papadakis, 1998; Zio, 2007). Indeed, efforts have been made in defining
    control measures aiming at reducing the likelihood of undesired outcomes through
    the development of proper regulatory environments within which all stakeholders
    make a significant contribution to the risk mitigation and control related to
    industrial accidents (M. D. Christou & Papadakis, 1998). Hence, due to its great
    importance, the interest in risk assessment has exponentially increased since
    the first studies in the early 1970s ( Pasman & Reniers, 2014), leading to the
    development of such a high number of methodologies that researchers and practitioners
    have tried to review them to provide useful overviews and classifications. Siu
    (1994), for example, depicted an overview of the risk assessment methodologies
    related to dynamic systems, whereas Khan and Abbasi (1998) presented a state-of-the-art
    review of risk assessment methodologies applied to chemical process industries.
    Tixier et al. (2002) then identified 62 different risk assessment methodologies
    for industrial plants and grouped them into three different categories, that is,
    identification, evaluation, and hierarchization. The work of Marhavilas et al.
    (2011) had a similar scope; they aimed to classify, categorize, and analyze the
    main risk assessment methodologies published in the period 2000–2009. Pitblado
    and Woodward (2011) and Animah and Shafiee (2020) then focused on risk assessment
    methodologies for liquefied natural gas (LNG). The former investigated the lesson
    learned and historical progress, the different prediction methods adopted, and
    the actual unresolved technical issues, whereas the latter proposed a categorization
    of the state-of-the-art publications on the topic. Moreover, Reniers and Cozzani
    (2013) and Necci et al. (2015) provided critical reviews on quantitative risk
    assessment (QRA) methodologies focusing on the domino effect in chemical and energy
    industrial sectors. Similarly, Villa et al. (2016) also provided an overview of
    the risk assessment methodologies related to the chemical process industry, but
    they focused on dynamic methodologies. However, although the just-mentioned reviews
    significantly contribute to providing an overview of the risk assessment methodologies
    available, they cannot be considered thoroughly exhaustive because they are either
    dated (Khan & Abbasi, 1998; Marhavilas et al., 2011; Siu, 1994; Tixier et al.,
    2002) or limited in scope because they focus only on one specific topic (e.g.,
    LNG, domino effect, etc.) (Animah & Shafiee, 2020; Necci et al., 2015; Pitblado
    & Woodward, 2011; Reniers & Cozzani, 2013; Villa et al., 2016). There is, hence,
    the need for an up-to-date work that not only focuses on a specific topic but
    also provides a comprehensive and complete overview of the risk assessment methodologies
    for EU industrial sites. The aim is also to aid researchers and practitioners
    in making more effective knowledge-based decisions through the review''s trends
    and advances in risk assessment methodologies highlighting the focal challenges
    to developing effective preventing strategies. In this work, we aim to fulfil
    this need. In particular, thanks to a novel and automated unsupervised machine
    learning-based clustering technique followed by a manual cleansing, we were able
    to identify five main research streams that have characterized the activities
    of researchers and practitioners over the years. We have presented and discussed
    the different risk assessment methodologies available in relation to the research
    stream that they belong to. The five research streams identified are (i) risk
    assessment methods for Seveso sites, (ii) bow-tie diagrams and safety barriers,
    (iii) process safety management, (iv) data-based risk assessment, and (v) health
    and environmental analysis. In each of them, we have discussed the different risk
    assessment methodologies proposed and studied by researchers and practitioners,
    their evolutions and modifications over the years, and their potential future
    developments. The article is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the methodology
    adopted, whereas Section 7 illustrates the five main topics identified and summarizes
    the works that constitute these topics. Section 13 then deals with the discussions,
    whereas in Section 14, conclusions and future research perspectives are depicted.
    2 METHODOLOGY To develop the up-to-date and comprehensive overview of the risk
    assessment methodologies for Seveso sites that represents the main goal of this
    work, we have carried out an extensive literature analysis. Moreover, we have
    decided to identify the research streams that have characterized the activities
    of researchers and practitioners over the years and to present and discuss the
    different risk assessment methodologies available according to the research stream
    that they belong to. To do so, we have leveraged an automated clustering followed
    by a manual cleansing of the results of the literature analysis. The use of an
    automated clustering based on unsupervised machine learning techniques represents
    a novel approach, and it allows us to reduce the inevitable bias of literature
    review works. Such bias, however, cannot be fully avoided, and manual cleansing
    of the obtained clusters is also required. The adoption of machine learning algorithms
    in systematic reviews can be considered a valuable tool to assist researchers
    in the screening of the set of collected literature. To the best of the authors’
    knowledge, the implementation of such techniques for risk assessment literature
    review is unknown, despite their increasingly recurrent usage. Nevertheless, in
    the last years, several studies have explored automated classification techniques
    to assess the relevancy of the literature on specific-oriented topics. For instance,
    literature research revealed automated classification focused on medical (Cohen
    et al., 2006; Timsina et al., 2016) and biomedical (Wallace et al., 2010) sectors,
    cloud manufacturing (Ellwein et al., 2020; Lolli et al., 2022; Sgarbossa et al.,
    2021), food safety (van den Bulk et al., 2022), and product returns (Duong et
    al., 2022). Recently, several authors presented different methodologies (Jaspers
    et al., 2018; Peron et al., 2020; Weißer et al., 2020), optimization techniques
    (Adinugroho et al., 2017; Peron et al., 2020), and frameworks (Peron et al., 2022;
    Simonetto et al., 2022; Tauchert et al., 2020) aiming at contributing to performing
    an objective, transparent, and reproducible documents-based search approach and
    enhancing the quality of the literature review. In the following, we will provide
    the details of the extensive literature analysis (Section 2) and of how the results
    of the literature analysis have been analyzed (Section 3), that is, automated
    clustering (Section 3) and manual cleansing (Section 4). 2.1 Literature analysis
    The proposed literature analysis is performed according to the principles of systematic
    reviews as described by Tranfield et al. (2003) with the purpose to ensure proper
    reproducibility and improving reporting quality. The basic idea is to develop
    a methodical approach involving the following steps: (i) documents identification
    through database searching, (ii) automated clustering of the selected papers in
    accordance with their representativity and suitability for the purpose of the
    study, and (iii) manually screening and eligibility of the clustered papers aiming
    at excluding the ones deemed irrelevant or at reassigning them to more adequate
    clusters after the full-text reading by the authors of this study. As said, the
    last two steps will be presented in the following Section 3. The first step consists
    of the documents’ identification through the definition of the specific keywords
    employed for paper selection as reported in Table 1. The procedure involves the
    adoption of a two-level keyword structure to coherently cover the published works
    related to the topic under investigation. Composed as follows, this structure
    based on a combination of keywords allows the collection of multiple and large-scale
    search terms: Group A has settled the main keywords that delineate the core topic
    of the review, that is, “risk assessment” or “risk analysis,” whereas in Group
    B was reported the subordinate keywords that explicitly depict the search scope.
    In this case, the keywords “Seveso” and “offshore directive” are used to include
    regulations for both onshore and offshore facilities, whereas “industry*” is employed
    to focus the search on the industrial domain. Thus, the logical operators “AND”
    and “OR” are applied to generate Boolean keyword combinations “(keyword of Group
    A) AND (keyword of Group B OR another keyword of Group B)” as reported in Hosseini
    et al. (2019). TABLE 1. Search keywords used in the systematic literature review
    Group A Group B “risk assessment” “risk analysis” “Seveso” “offshore directive”
    “industr*” The Elsevier''s database-denominated Scopus was used for the literature
    analysis, where the adopted search-based approach was automatically performed.
    Then, the following restricted criteria were settled as a threshold for papers
    to be included in this study: search string limited to “Title, Abstract and Keywords”;
    papers limited to journal articles, reviews, conference papers, and book chapters
    (technical reports, thesis, etc., were excluded); papers published in the English
    language; papers were only considered once. Hence, a total of 559 articles were
    obtained from the identification step of the proposed literature analysis. Then,
    starting from this start set, the goal is to classify and investigate the main
    research streams in the field of risk assessment and analysis aiming at specifying
    the contributions and at identifying gaps and future research directions. To do
    so, a subject matter-oriented categorization procedure performed through an automated
    unsupervised machine learning-based clustering technique (step 2) as well as the
    inclusion/exclusion criteria introduced for the manual cleansing (step 3) are
    presented in the following section. Finally, the achieved results of the literature
    analysis were then analyzed by considering the final set of documents and the
    related clusters as described in Section 7. 2.2 Analysis of search results 2.2.1
    Automated clustering The second step involves the classification of the papers
    collected in the first step to facilitate and enhance the detection of the main
    research streams that have characterized the activities of researchers and practitioners
    over the years. To do so, the start set resulting from the literature analysis
    was analyzed by means of the Orange software for machine learning (Demšar et al.,
    2013). Only the article titles and abstracts were considered as a corpus of text
    documents to preprocess. The keywords are excluded because they are not consistently
    reported throughout the articles. A preprocessing of the corpus was crucial for
    achieving a better quality analysis of the results (Cantini et al., 2022; Denny
    & Spirling, 2017; Simonetto et al., 2021; Uysal & Gunal, 2014). It included: transformation
    to lower case, removal of accents, detection of html tags to parse out text only,
    and removal of urls; tokenization to break the text into smaller components; normalization
    for stemming and lemmatization to words; filtering to remove a selection of stop-words.
    In addition, a word count for each article (considering only title and abstract)
    was carried out. In this way, each article was characterized by a vector whose
    values in each dimension correspond to the number of times the term appears in
    the article (Singhal, 2001). The cosine distance (i.e., the cosine of the angle
    between two vectors of an inner product space) gives a useful measure of how different
    two documents are likely to be in terms of their subject matter. For this reason,
    a matrix of distances between all the articles in the corpus was computed. The
    matrix of distances allowed hierarchical clustering to be performed. Hierarchical
    clustering is an unsupervised technique for data exploration analysis, which seeks
    to build a hierarchy of clusters. It produces a binary merge tree, starting from
    the leaves (the articles) and proceeding by merging two by two the “closest” subsets
    (stored at nodes) until the root of the tree containing all the elements is reached
    (Nielsen, 2016). The graphical representation of this binary merge tree is a dendrogram.
    Therefore, the automated clustering is based on hierarchical clustering resulted
    in seven different clusters (Figure 1). The results of the hierarchical clustering
    were also validated by two other techniques, that is, Louvain clustering and K-means
    clustering. The algorithm of Louvain clustering provided by Orange is based on
    the Louvain method for community detection, which is a method to extract communities
    from large networks (Blondel et al., 2008; Lambiotte et al., 2008). K-means clustering
    is an unsupervised learning algorithm classifying a given data set into a number
    of clusters defined by the letter “K,” which is fixed beforehand (Demšar et al.,
    2013). Orange runs the K-means clustering algorithm for several values of “K”
    and selects the one with the highest silhouette. The silhouette value contrasts
    average distance to elements in the same cluster with the average distance to
    elements in other clusters. FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Dendrogram
    obtained from the analysis of the search results As a result of this validation,
    the Louvain clustering confirmed the optimal number of seven clusters, whereas
    K-means clustering provided the silhouette values in Table 2, showing a high silhouette
    value for the same configuration (i.e., for a number of clusters equal to seven).
    The K-means analysis was carried out considering only values between five and
    eight for the parameter “K” to avoid clusters that are excessively large (or small)
    and might not be representative for the purpose of this study. TABLE 2. Silhouette
    values for number of clusters between 5 and 8 obtained through K-means clustering
    Number of clusters Silhouette 5 0.026 6 0.038 7 0.061 8 0.030 2.2.2 Manual cleansing
    Once the number of clusters was validated, the third step of the search-based
    approach involves the manual cleansing of the obtained clusters. An overall research
    stream is identified for each cluster through the screening procedure based on
    the full-text reading of the articles included. Moreover, documents proved not
    to be appropriate with the preestablished clusters are reassigned to other clusters,
    whereas the ones deemed irrelevant or to be outside our scope are excluded from
    the study. Concerning the criteria exclusion, the papers were read by all the
    authors to confirm adequacy with the topics, whereas any discrepancies or conflicts
    were resolved by double-check-oriented discussion and final consensus among all
    the authors. Thus, the silhouette values associated with each article (measuring
    how similar the article is to its own cluster compared to other clusters) are
    considered for both defining the overall research stream (high silhouette articles
    generally provide a clear outline of the cluster topic) and reassigning or excluding
    articles. If required, this substep may also lead to a slight rearrangement of
    the cluster configuration. This substep must be carried out manually, as the automated
    process cannot avoid misinterpretation of article topics. Therefore, after this
    refinement, a number of 200 documents were collected. The reassignment and the
    exclusion actions have led to a reduction of the number of clusters from seven
    to five. One cluster (cluster C1 in Figure 1) was, in fact, not considered relevant
    for this study, as it mainly focused on laboratory safety in the case of exposure
    to toxic substances, whereas two clusters (clusters C2 and C5 in Figure 1) were
    merged due to the vicinity of their topics. Thus, the different steps involved
    in this literature analysis process are reported in Figure 2. FIGURE 2 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Schematic of the literature analysis process Finally,
    the research streams corresponding to each cluster are the following: risk assessment
    methods for Seveso sites (deriving from clusters C2 and C5 in Figure 1); bow-tie
    diagrams and safety barriers (deriving from cluster C3 in Figure 1); process safety
    management (deriving from cluster C4 in Figure 1); data-based risk assessment
    (deriving from cluster C6 in Figure 1); health and environmental analysis (deriving
    from cluster C7 in Figure 1). In the following, we will describe separately each
    of these research streams, discussing the related risk assessment methodologies
    proposed and studied by researchers and practitioners, their evolutions and modifications
    over the years, and their potential future developments. 3 CLUSTERS ANALYSIS AND
    DISCUSSION As said, the final set of documents achieved by the systematic literature
    review was grouped in different topic clusters aiming at providing comprehensive
    coverage of the specific subjects analyzed. In the following subsections, we will
    focus on the content analysis of the most relevant selected papers drawing a clear
    picture of the research domain with the purpose of providing an integrated and
    synthesized overview of the current state of knowledge. Nevertheless, a summary
    of the collected studies proposed in this literature review is given in Appendix
    A. Hence, the main research findings in the field of risk assessment and analysis
    were discussed for each cluster highlighting the different methodologies and approaches
    adopted as well as the recent trends and future perspectives. Moreover, the word
    clouds for each cluster have been developed to depict immediate insights into
    the most prominent themes on which the selected papers are focused. This word-frequency
    analysis allows displaying the diverse research concerns characterizing the topic
    clusters because the size of each word in the cloud is in proportion to its probability
    within the topic. Finally, the distribution of the collected papers has been provided
    according to (i) a temporal axis, (ii) citations and journal perspective, and
    (iii) type of articles published (original research, case study, or review article).
    Thus, Figure 3 exhibits the temporal distribution of published papers from 1984
    to 2020 (up to May 2020), the percentage over time, and the cumulative trend aiming
    at providing an index of the popularity and the relevance of the risk assessment
    in the Seveso sites. In this figure, two different trends can be distinguished.
    It can be observed that the trend of publications gradually increases during the
    years from 1984 to 2003, whereas a significant growth occurs starting from 2004.
    Indeed, the number of documents published in the last 16 years is 172, accounting
    for c.a. 82% of the total ones, thus resulting in that this research topic has
    gained increasing attention of researchers and practitioners in recent years.
    FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Annual distribution of collected references
    On the other hand, the collected documents are distributed over a total of 52
    different journals, 4 books, and 12 conference proceedings. Table 3 summarizes
    the top 15 sources reported by both number of documents and percentage related
    to the total of those collected. It is worth mentioning that the risk assessment
    topic in Seveso sites seems to be discussed mainly in such high-quality peer-reviewed
    journals than in conference proceedings. As can be seen, Journal of Loss Prevention
    in the Process Industries and Journal of Hazardous Materials are the leading journals
    in this field with a total of 60 documents and 2476 citations resulting in a contribution
    equal to 30 % of the collected dataset and approximately 58% of the total number
    of citations, respectively. In Table 4, the general structure of the citations
    for the entire dataset and each specific cluster has been reported. This structure
    shows that fewer than 4 % of the collected documents have at least or more than
    100 citations, whereas most of them are categorized within the class characterized
    by fewer than 20%. Concerning the different clusters, cluster C3, that is, bow-tie
    diagrams and safety barriers, and cluster C6, that is, data-based risk assessment,
    are the ones that denote the higher percentage value of documents that have received
    at least or more than 100 citations, whereas cluster C7, that is, health and environmental
    analysis, only covers the classes referring to the documents that have received
    less than 50 citations. Finally, Tables 5 and 6 report a classification of the
    basic structure and the individual characteristic of the collected documents by
    journal classification and defined clusters, respectively. Thus, the number of
    the documents published in each journal and cluster has been reported, while four
    different categories have been defined according to their type of content: framework,
    mathematical model, review, or descriptive analysis. In these tables, books have
    not been included, while concerning the category referred to descriptive analysis,
    we considered all the documents that cannot be included in the other categories
    but they deal with surveys, managerial and organizational aspects, qualitative
    analysis, human factors in risk assessment, comparative evaluation of regulations,
    and so on. It is worth mentioning that a large portion of the studies examined
    more contents, for example, both mathematical models and case studies. Table 5
    shows that the Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries and the Journal
    of Hazardous Materials are the most effective journals in the field were examined.
    It can be observed that, among the selected categories, mathematical models and
    case studies are the most dealt with. Indeed, most international regulations require
    the adoption of QRA techniques aiming at supporting the decision-making process
    for the industrial sites potentially involved with catastrophic failure consequences.
    Therefore, over the years, various methodologies based on mathematical and computational
    models have been developed and applied by researchers and practitioners resulting
    in a key role in the field of risk analysis for identifying and quantifying potential
    accident probabilities and consequences. TABLE 3. Top 15 sources in the collected

    columns since some works deal with more than one content. Same considerations
    could be made by analyzing the results reported in Table 6, where the characteristics
    of the collected documents are categorized within the defined clusters. It is
    worth mentioning that mathematical models is the most frequently discussed topic
    for four clusters over five (bow-tie diagrams and safety barriers, process safety
    management, data-based risk assessment, and health and environmental analysis),
    while for risk assessment methods for Seveso sites cluster, most of the documents
    are focused on case study. However, one significant achievement is the limited
    number of literature reviews; especially, concerning the bow-tie diagrams and
    safety barriers, no specific document is found out. TABLE 6. Individual characteristics

    Seveso sites The cluster “Risk assessment methods for Seveso sites” consists of
    68 articles, namely, 67 journal papers and 1 conference proceedings. By analyzing
    the word cloud reported in Figure 4, the cluster has a focus on risk assessment
    methodologies for Seveso industrial sites and specifically focuses on major accident
    scenarios. However, different subdomain topics have been identified and analyzed
    in the following. Indeed, research streams based on QRA techniques, land-use planning
    (LUP) policy, and domino effects provide a high contribution emerging in terms
    of popularity and importance within this cluster. FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Word cloud of “Risk assessment methods for Seveso sites” cluster This
    cluster represents the core of the current study, and as described in the introduction
    and confirmed by the high number of review studies herein included (Jain et al.,
    2017; Li et al., 2017; Pasman et al., 2017; Tixier et al., 2002), it has also
    represented a major area of interest for other researchers and practitioners.
    At first, to a large extent, the ideas and principles of risk assessment and management
    methodologies have been rooted in the nuclear sector (Pasman & Reniers, 2014)
    where quantified risk analysis has been conceptualized. However, over time, they
    emerged as a suitable solution for managing and controlling major hazards; thus,
    they have developed increasingly effective practices, methods, and techniques
    covering most of the industrial, economic, and societal fields. This is highlighted
    by Campos Venuti et al. (1984), who compared how risk is managed across the chemical
    and the nuclear industrial sectors in Italy, and recalled by Pasman and Reniers
    (2014) and Taveau (2010), who described how the lessons learned from the nuclear
    industry are nowadays employed within the chemical industry. Most of these lessons
    learned have been transferred to the Seveso regulations and policies, which were
    discussed by several authors from the points of view of application, national
    specificities, gaps, improvement, and validation by the regulator (Bottelberghs,
    2000; Hawksley, 1992; Lindhout & Reniers, 2017; Naime & Andrey, 2013; Pasman et
    al., 2009; Siddiqui et al., 2012). For example, Fabbri and Contini (2009) analyzed
    the inspection criteria and practices adopted by the different national authorities
    for the implementation of the Seveso Directive. Over the years, researchers and
    practitioners have widely focused on QRA, either providing frameworks that assist
    the risk assessment process or developing new/adapting existing methodologies.
    Dealing with the former, Filippin and Dreher (2004) developed a framework that
    supports the integration of risk assessment methodologies with normal business
    management processes. Arunraj and Maiti (2009) and Basheer et al. (2019) then
    provided a template and a framework for QRA of Seveso sites by estimating and
    aggregating the major losses. Another consistent framework is illustrated in Reniers
    (2009), where both processes risks from hazards and operators risks are taken
    into consideration aimed at optimizing the risk management. These works reported
    as key aspects of a correct risk assessment those that define the accident scenarios
    affecting the risk assessment and that adopt proper mitigation measures. Specifically,
    once the plausible threats and their impacts/effects are identified, the system''s
    weaknesses need to be identified to identify the proper mitigation measures. Einarsson
    and Rausand (1998) proposed a framework for vulnerability analysis of complex
    industrial systems. It is worth mentioning that the vulnerability of industrial
    sites is highly influenced by the occurrence of extreme weather events (Cruz &
    Krausmann, 2013; Nivolianitou et al., 2004). Dealing with the development of new
    risk assessment methodologies and/or the adaptation of existing ones, Felegeanu
    et al. (2016) combined the strength of already existing methods (Mosar, ARAMIS,
    Checklist, Octave, and Mehari) to develop a new risk assessment methodology called
    combined analysis risk method and industries security/dangerous substances (CARMIS/DS)
    that aims to determine, both quantitatively and qualitatively, the risk or safety
    level for the installations/technologies used in the manufacturing process. Planas
    et al. (2006) then presented a methodology to develop a specific risk severity
    index. Furthermore, Markowski and Sam Mannan (2010) proposed a quantitative methodology
    called ExSys-LOPA for the risk assessment of a conversion unit within a petroleum
    refinery that was developed through the combination of experts’ knowledge in accident
    scenario identification and layer of protection analysis (LOPA). Qureshi (1988)
    then adopted the HAZOP methodology, similar to Bernatik and Libisova (2004) and
    Fuentes-Bargues et al. (2017), who presented the integration of HAZOP and fault
    tree analysis for the unloading/storage of dangerous substances in maritime port
    facilities and for gasholders in industrial facilities, respectively. Antonioni
    et al. (2009) then proposed a QRA methodology focusing on the domino effect aimed
    at avoiding escalation hazards in the chemical and process industry. Always dealing
    with QRA, Bonvicini et al. (2012) developed a methodology based on the cutoff
    criteria to support QRA to account for the offsite population by evaluating the
    probability of its presence in potential impact areas when a major accident occurs.
    D''alessandro et al. (2016) then presented a QRA methodology consisting of hazardous
    zones definition, loss-of-containment evaluation, and vulnerability models for
    an LNG facility, whereas Ηatzisymeon et al. (2019) applied QRA based on operational
    risk management (ORM) to the life cycle of the biodiesel production from used
    cooking oil by investigating its impact on the entire supply chain. Furthermore,
    Landucci et al. (2017) studied QRA in the field of hazardous materials transportation,
    focusing on the analysis of current procedures and tools as well as on the different
    methodologies available. Krausmann et al. (2011) and Gheorghiu et al. (2014) studied
    QRA for the assessment or the risks related to another type of threat for Seveso
    sites, that is, threats deriving from natural agents (a.k.a. Natech events); the
    former provided a nine steps-based innovative approach framed into QRA, whereas
    the latter compared the Individual Risk and Societal Risk achieved between conventional
    technological risk and Natech risk, focusing on specific events such as an earthquake
    for two petroleum product tanks. Moreno et al. (2019) then applied a QRA based
    on a consequence-based approach for a biomass power plant, focusing on the Biofine
    process to identify relevant accident scenarios (RAS). Furthermore, Cozzani and
    Zanelli (2015) discussed the available tools for QRA and the related open problems,
    focusing on the quantitative area risk analysis (QARA) techniques for LUP, which
    has represented a theme of high research interest in the last few years. LUP allows
    the interaction between sources of risk and vulnerabilities in surrounding areas
    to be addressed. Christou et al. (2011), in fact, discussing the activities of
    the European Working Group operating under the coordination of the European Commission''s
    Joint Research Centre, emphasized the importance of LUP to guarantee a high level
    of security and well-being to the population. Moreover, the authors provided an
    overview of methodologies, tools, and approaches as a guidance to support EU Member
    States. In fact, as already mentioned above, a significant amount of research
    works on LUP have been undertaken over the last decades due to its strategic importance
    in accident prevention. Some frameworks have also been developed in this perspective
    (Hauptmanns, 2005), but most of the works deal with the development of new methodologies.
    Ale et al. (1999), for example, presented a methodology based on performance criteria
    to evaluate the factors influencing the societal risks when a new LUP is implemented,
    whereas Laheij et al. (2000) dealt with the societal risks by adopting a distance
    density figures (DDFs) approach. The methodology proposed by Ma et al. (2015)
    was based on the ARAMIS project and consisted of the simultaneous analysis of
    the severity of the major accidents and the vulnerability of the surrounding environment;
    hence, both severity and vulnerability indexes were used in the LUP practice.
    Török et al. (2011) focused the analysis instead on the safety distance in LPU
    when fires and flammable hazardous materials are involved, whereas Papazoglou
    et al. (2000) presented a multicriteria methodology for supporting the decision-making
    process in LUP. The geographic information system (GIS) tool, in particular, has
    been widely used in the LUP. For example, a GIS-based maps threat analysis was
    used by Kontić and Kontić (2009) to integrate the consequence analysis, the results
    of QRA, and the environmental vulnerability analysis, whereas Török et al. (2020)
    combined the GIS tool with consequence and risk modeling software to include territorial
    compatibility assessments in the analysis of accident scenarios. Moreover, another
    topic that has widely been investigated when dealing with LUP is the domino effect.
    Khakzad and Reniers (2015), for example, aiming to optimize the plant layout around
    a major hazard installation, considered the impact of the domino effects on the
    LUP requirements through a Bayesian network methodology. Seveso II [96/82/EC]
    and III [2003/105/EC] Directives, in fact, place particular emphasis on domino
    effects by pointing out the need to identify which establishments are potentially
    affected by scenarios where the consequences of a major accident may be increased
    because of it. However, addressing domino effects constitutes a significant challenge
    to risk management due to the complexity of evolution prediction and modeling
    the accident scenario (Reniers & Cozzani, 2013). A number of studies addressing
    this subject are available in the literature. Reniers et al. (2005b) and Antonioni
    et al. (2009) analyzed the domino effect framed into QRA. The former proposed
    an approach based on damage probability estimation, vulnerability assessment,
    and risk recomposition, whereas the latter provided an outlook on the current
    practices focusing on the chemical industry. Cozzani et al. (2006) then investigated
    the equipment damage models to identify the proper criteria characterizing the
    escalation of accident scenarios. Moreover, different frameworks have been developed
    to properly deal with domino effects. Reniers et al. (2005a), for example, proposed
    an external domino accident prevention framework by combining risk analysis with
    risk evaluation, whereas Ghasemi and Nourai (2017) referred to the spacing optimization
    in LUP analysis by focusing on thermal radiation accidents in the presence of
    storage tanks. Furthermore, Jia et al. (2017) developed a five-level hierarchical
    framework in which the domino effect is analyzed by considering the equipment
    vulnerability assessment approach. Further works on domino effects can be found
    in the comprehensive review presented by Necci et al. (2015). 3.2 Bow-tie diagrams
    and safety barriers The “Bow-tie diagrams and safety barriers” cluster consists
    of 26 articles, of which 15 are journal papers and 11 are conference papers. From
    the analysis of the word cloud reported in Figure 5, it can be seen that these
    documents deal with the risk analysis (which is a part of the risk assessment
    together with risk identification). Particularly, within the risk analysis, bow-tie
    diagrams and safety barriers emerge to be very important; thus, this cluster reports
    their implementation focusing on the strength and the limitation within the risk
    assessment. FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Word cloud of “Bow-tie diagrams
    and safety barriers” cluster The high importance of bow-tie diagrams and safety
    barriers within the risk analysis is due to the fact that bow-tie diagrams and
    safety barriers represent the two main features of the ARAMIS methodology. The
    ARAMIS methodology was developed from 2002 to 2005 to answer the growing interest
    of industries for a clear methodology for risk analysis, and since then, it has
    become the “supportive tool to speed up the harmonized implementation of SEVESO
    II Directive in Europe” (Salvi & Debray, 2006). The ARAMIS methodology consists
    of six main steps (identification of major accident hazards, identification of
    the safety barriers, assessment of their performances, evaluation of safety management
    efficiency to barrier reliability, identification of reference accident scenarios,
    assessment and mapping of the risk severity of reference scenarios and of the
    vulnerability of the plant surroundings), and bow-tie diagrams and safety barriers
    are part of the first, second, and third steps, respectively. Bow-tie diagrams
    are used in the identification of major accident hazards, and they are centered
    on a critical event with the causes leading to the critical event on the left
    (i.e., fault tree) and the consequences of the critical event on the right (i.e.,
    event tree) (De Dianous & Fiévez, 2006). Moreover, bow-tie diagrams also capture
    the influence of safety systems. Gowland (2006) reported that the identification
    of major accident hazards can also be carried out in combination with other methods,
    such as HAZOP study, “What if” and FMEA. Particularly, Afefy (2015) was the first
    to integrate FMEA with bow tie and to apply it in the process industry (Emisal
    company in Fayoum city), showing the great potential of this approach. Similarly,
    Delvosalle et al. (2006) and Tugnoli et al. (2013) applied bow-tie diagrams to
    two complementary approaches for the identification of a reference accident scenario,
    that is, the methodology for the identification of reference accident scenarios
    (MIRASs) and the methodology for the identification of major accident hazards
    (MIMAH). It is worth mentioning that Wilday et al. (2011) presented an innovative
    methodology named dynamic procedure for atypical scenarios identification (DyPASI)
    as a complementary part of the MIMAH bow-tie methodology. Furthermore, a bow-tie
    approach based on adopting a fault tree and event tree for each critical event
    is also used in the methodology developed by Zhang et al. (2017) for accident
    scenario identification, that is, worst maximum credible accident scenarios (WMCAS).
    In addition, bow ties can also be used for safety management and organizational
    learning. In fact, due to the relative simplicity of their graphical representation
    particularly compared to other risk-analysis tools such as fault trees, event
    trees, and Bayesian networks (Duijm, 2009), bow-tie diagrams are also easily understandable
    by nonexperts, and this can thus enhance the safety management and contribute
    to the organizational learning for safety (Chevreau et al., 2006; Duijm, 2009).
    However, although their graphic representation represents the main advantage of
    bow-tie diagrams, it also represents their main drawback because it does not allow
    the consideration of the dynamic aspect of real systems. Badreddine and Amor (2013)
    overcame this drawback by proposing a new approach where bow ties are mapped on
    to a Bayesian network and are learned from real data; in such a way, classical
    bow ties are enriched with a probabilistic numerical component that can be used
    for dynamic implementation of preventive and protective barriers. The adoption
    of a bow-tie model mapped in a Bayesian network is also presented by van Staalduinen
    et al. (2017), where a quantitative security risk analysis (QSRA) is performed
    to protect the critical process infrastructure. A similar limitation can also
    be found for safety barriers. During the design phase, all barriers are assumed
    to be fully functioning, and the assessment of their performances in the third
    step of the ARAMIS methodology (which can also be carried out using the LOPA according
    to Gowland, 2006) is carried out considering this status. This, of course, leads
    to the determination of a certain risk. However, barriers degrade in service and
    so do their performances, thus increasing the risk. Therefore, to keep the risk
    level as low as possible, a barrier management that considers the dynamic nature
    of safety barriers needs to be considered. An example can be found in Pitblado
    et al. (2016a). 3.3 Process safety management The “Process safety management”
    cluster consists of 51 articles, of which 32 are journal papers, 17 are conference
    papers, and 2 are book chapters. From the analysis of the word cloud reported
    in Figure 6, it can be seen that these documents deal with the risk assessment
    and safety management system (SMS) with a special focus on their interconnections
    and integrations. In addition, the emerging trend dealing with the development
    of new advanced dynamic methodologies able to handle significant issues such as
    the aging of equipment and the optimization of the emergency planning has been
    identified and analyzed in this cluster. Although new applications of the risk
    assessment methodologies have recently been shown, such as that reported by Bernechea
    and Arnaldos (2014) where QRA has been combined with inherently safer design (ISD)
    to optimize the design of storage facilities, their main use is related to the
    development of a safety management strategy (SMS). Specifically, Demichela and
    coauthors stated that “a correct and careful risk analysis is necessary to design
    and implement a SMS able to pursue its objectives” (Demichela et al., 2004). FIGURE
    6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Word cloud of “Process safety management” cluster
    As seen before, different types of risk assessment methodologies have been developed
    over the years, both quantitative and qualitative (the latter mainly for unquantifiable
    known hazards and unknown hazards) (Kongsvik et al., 2010; Lindhout, 2019). The
    most common risk assessment methodologies have been briefly reviewed by Maroño
    et al. (2006), who highlighted their pros and cons. In their work, Maroño et al.
    (2006) pointed out the criticalities of some methodologies with respect to the
    accuracy of the results of their risk analysis phase, also taking into account
    the uncertainties of the input data such as frequency and failure rates (in this
    perspective, Jain et al., 2018, proposed the use of Bayesian analysis) because
    this would have affected the SMSs. To overcome the criticalities that they highlighted,
    they proposed a new methodology called “PROCESO” that “attempts to contribute
    towards the development of a more comprehensive safety assessment method” by combining
    the advantages of the reviewed methodologies. In turn, SMS also affects the results
    of the risk analysis. In fact, it has been reported that management factors represent
    a frequent underlying cause of many accidents that have occurred in the past,
    especially the release of hazardous substances in chemical installations (Hurst
    et al., 1991; Paté-Cornell & Bea, 1992). It is thus clear that different SMSs
    lead to different risks. Therefore, in the last few years, many researchers have
    focused on integrating SMSs with risk analysis approaches, particularly QRA. The
    first attempts consisted mainly of judgmental modifications of the frequencies
    of releases according to the results of audits of the SMS (Hurst et al., 1996;
    Pitblado et al., 1990). The main drawback of these methodologies was the fact
    that the modification of the frequency was subjective. Papazoglou and coauthors
    tried to overcome this limitation by developing a methodology (called I-Risk)
    for the estimation of the frequencies of release of hazardous substances (Papazoglou
    et al., 2002, 2003). The methodology was then further developed by Demichela and
    Piccinini (2006). Specifically, they modified the last two steps of the I-Risk
    methodology, that is, the modeling of the SMS and the modification of the frequency
    of loss of containment according to the SMS. However, these methods did not receive
    great acceptance in practice mainly due to the fact that the assessment of the
    management influence on risk was done in the form of an audit, which is complex
    in its application. Acikalin (2009b) tried to overcome this limitation by developing
    a new methodology that introduces a scoring system and a management factor. From
    what was just stated, it emerges that the adoption of a proper SMS is a key aspect
    because it affects the results of the risk assessment. Several SMSs have been
    developed over the years, as shown by the existence of several reviews (Kirchsteiger,
    2002, 2005; Li & Guldenmund, 2018). Specifically, Li and Guldenmund (2018) reviewed
    more than 40 SMSs, reported that 86% of them use an audit as an assessment tool
    for the safety management, and reported Hale''s SMS as the most complete because
    it contains both risk control elements and learning elements (Hale, 2005). Based
    on the above-described importance of the SMSs, it is thus clear that researchers
    are continuously focusing on their improvements. Specifically, two main research
    streams have emerged, that is, the necessity (i) to consider the aging of equipment
    (Bragatto & Milazzo, 2016) and (ii) to optimize the emergency planning (Fabiano
    et al., 2016). Dealing with the former, aging of plants and equipment due to corrosion
    and other phenomena is a serious issue, and therefore, the SMS should ensure that
    each critical equipment is subjected to a schedule of checks adequately planned
    to guarantee the attainment of safety requirements (Vairo et al., 2018). In this
    perspective, Bragatto and Milazzo (2019) suggested using a system dynamic concept
    to improve safety management, where the general focus of safety studies needs
    to shift from the analyses of previous failures to the prevention of critical
    events considering accidents as changes in performance, whereas Bevilacqua et
    al. (2020) developed a Digital Twin reference model for risk prediction and prevention
    by enabling predictive maintenance applications. Similarly, Paltrinieri et al.
    (2019) proposed a machine learning algorithm based on deep neural networks (DNN)
    for risk prediction in response to a system''s operating condition using data
    provided by the World Offshore Accident Database (WOAD). Dealing with the optimization
    of emergency planning, instead, Antonionia and Moreno (2019) suggested using a
    continuous improvement approach to optimize the emergency planning, and they developed
    a procedure for this. Fundamental for a successful application of a continuous
    improvement approach is to learn from previous, whereas (both previous incidents
    and “near misses”), and hence, effective communication is needed (Jones et al.,
    1999; Ramsay, 1999). 3.4 Data-based risk assessment The clustering algorithm has
    identified a group of 31 articles in total for the “Data-based risk assessment”
    cluster, consisting of 23 journal papers, 7 conference papers, and 1 book contribution.
    Figure 7 shows the word cloud resulting from the clustering process, from which
    it can be seen that these contributions are mainly focused on data-based methods
    for risk analysis. This cluster is organized as follows: first, an overview of
    data-based risk assessment methods and their evolution over time is provided aiming
    at depicting their importance for the identification and prioritization of proper
    safety improvements. Second, the most suitable methodologies adopted by researchers
    and practitioners have been reported, while finally, the documents dealing with
    shared datasets, case studies, and specific data-oriented tools have been analyzed.
    FIGURE 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Word cloud of “Data-based risk assessment”
    cluster Due to the great consequences that accident events have on safety and
    operations performance, it is crucial to properly estimate their occurrence with
    accurate quantitative risk analysis methods. In the past 10 years, there has been
    an evolution in the risk analysis methodologies, moving from more traditional
    probabilistic ones like fault tree, event tree, and bow tie to more advanced dynamic
    ones, such as Bayesian approaches, because the traditional ones have limited capabilities
    to handle evolving conditions and data unavailability (a comprehensive state-of-the-art
    analysis of these methods for chemical industrial applications can be found in
    Roy et al., 2014). Zavadskas and Vaidogas (2008) demonstrated that the uncertainty
    in failure probabilities due to evolving conditions and unavailable data can be
    reduced by applying a Bayesian updating procedure when new data on equipment failures
    are obtained. A relevant example of a dynamic approach has been developed by Khakzad
    et al. (2012), where the data related to failure probability of the primary events
    are estimated and updated constantly when physical parameters of the system vary.
    Moreover, this is integrated with a Bayesian approach for the dynamic estimation
    of the failure probability of the safety barriers. In a following research, the
    same authors applied bow-tie and Bayesian network methods in the quantitative
    risk analysis of blowouts in drilling operations (Khakzad et al., 2013). First,
    they built the bow-tie model combining a fault tree and an event tree for potential
    accident scenarios. Then, individual Bayesian networks and an object-oriented
    Bayesian network were developed, considering common cause failures and conditional
    dependencies along with performing probability updating and sequential learning
    using accident precursors. Similarly, Babaleye et al. (2019) and Chang et al.
    (2019) applied the Bayesian network for a dynamic safety analysis of the plugging
    and abandonment of oil and gas wells and the deep-water drilling riser, respectively.
    Furthermore, Bayesian networks have also been used for evaluation of the domino
    effect, where Khakzad et al. (2018) and Zeng et al. (2020) implemented a dynamic
    model of wildfire spread by using the Bayesian network. Noret et al. (2012), instead,
    presented a dynamic risk assessment model based on uncertainty propagation methods
    to be applied when accident explosions occur. Berdouzi et al. (2018) then used
    dynamic simulation to answer this need for dynamicity, and they combined it with
    HAZOP analysis and decision matrix risk assessment to assess the risk of an exothermic
    reaction in a semibatch reactor, whereas Paltrinieri and Reniers (2017) introduced
    three complementary methods to address dynamic risk assessment of high impact
    low probability (HILP) events on different levels, that is, dynamic hazard identification,
    dynamic analysis of initiating events, and dynamic analysis of consequences. The
    Bayesian network and its simulation can also be used to capture very well the
    relationships between causes and effects: Unnikrishnan et al. (2015), in fact,
    reported that the ability to simulate the network in the forward direction in
    predictive mode (causes to effects) as well as in diagnostics mode (effects to
    causes) is the most important advantage of the Bayesian network. Most of the time,
    they are integrated with a bow-tie model to identify the risk factors of the failure
    event and the potential consequences. An example can be found in Wu et al. (2019),
    who modeled H2S leakage in sour gas fields during pressure drilling phases with
    a bow-tie approach for the accident cause-consequence analysis and integrated
    dynamic characteristics with probability estimation thanks to dynamic Bayesian
    networks. A similar work can be found in Zhang et al. (2018). In the absence or
    with the scarcity of data about major accidents, several approaches have been
    developed based on data related to near accidents (accident precursor data). Khakzad
    et al. (2014) proposed a methodology based on hierarchical Bayesian analysis based
    on accident precursor data for the risk analysis of major accidents. A multinomial
    likelihood function has been applied to model the dependency and interaction between
    data related to accidents and near accidents. The methodology has been applied
    to drilling operations. A similar approach has been developed for the Bhopal disaster
    and accident releases of hazardous chemicals from process facilities (Yang et
    al., 2015). They proposed to use a precursor-based Bayesian network approach for
    probability estimation and loss functions for consequence assessment. The dynamicity
    of the problem is taken into consideration by updating the risk profile with real-time
    operational data. Yang et al. (2015) then proposed a holistic precursor-based
    risk assessment framework for rare events, implementing a hierarchical Bayesian
    approach (HBA) for the probability estimation, whereas accident precursor data
    have been utilized to find the most informative precursor upon which the consequence
    of a rare event is estimated. Also, in this case, the risk profile is updated
    as soon as new information is available. In addition to the new methodologies,
    this cluster included a group of papers related to the dataset, case studies available,
    and tools developed to support the analysis of these datasets. In Ditali et al.
    (2000), the authors developed a software tool called Atlantide for the consequence
    analysis in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) installation. The software is based
    on models and equations developed in the literature that take into account many
    physical parameters and external factors. Jacobsson et al. (2010) then presented
    the major accident reporting system (MARS), which is a system that was established
    and maintained by the European Commission in order to collect information related
    to major industrial accidents in the EU Member States in the context of the Seveso
    II Directive. The main goal was to collect information for a better understanding
    of the accidents through the determination of the causes, particularly the underlying
    causes. An interesting contribution to case studies is Pasman (2011), where a
    historical overview of the Dutch process equipment failures is given, analyzed
    by explaining the policy backgrounds and comparing with other data. Pitblado et
    al. (2011) then analyzed different datasets available, and they concluded that
    the UK HSE Hydrocarbon Release Database (HCRD) provides the basis for the best
    leak frequency data. Furthermore, Moura et al. (2017) developed a framework to
    verify if tendencies and patterns observed in major accidents were appropriately
    contemplated by risk studies. They also developed an attribute list to validate
    risk assessment studies and to ensure that the influence of human factors, technological
    issues, and organizational aspects was properly taken into account. 3.5 Health
    and environmental analysis The “Health and environmental analysis” is the last
    cluster identified by the algorithm, and it contains in total 24 documents, of
    which 23 are journal papers and 1 is a book contribution. Figure 8 depicts the
    word cloud resulting from the clustering process, where it is clear that this
    cluster contains contributions that are mainly focused on the analysis of the
    environmental and health impact of accidents. Hence, this cluster first reviewed
    documents that separately are focused on one of these two critical aspects, and
    then the integrated approaches including both environmental and health risk assessments
    have been presented. FIGURE 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Word cloud of “Health
    and environmental analysis” cluster Environmental and health risk assessment is
    a complex and interdisciplinary research area that is used to estimate potential
    risks to protect ecosystems and human health from accidents. In the last decades,
    many articles have been developed in this area, with most of them treating separately
    environmental risk assessment (ERA) and health risk assessment; few of them present
    integrated approaches. The first methods have been developed decades ago. Concerning
    the ERA methodologies, an example is the work presented by Stefanis and Pistikopoulos
    (1997) where a quantitative methodology has been developed linking process reliability
    considerations to environmental impact analysis within a process optimization
    framework. Recently, driven by the implementation of the Seveso III Directive,
    Sikorova et al. (2017) collected and analyzed experiences, knowledge, as well
    as new approaches for the prevention of major accidents with impacts on the environment.
    After presenting a statistical analysis of environmental accidents in Czech Republic
    and Italy, a methodological approach has been illustrated where selected methodologies
    are used for ERA. Moreover, researchers and practitioners have not only focused
    on the plant but have also considered other sectors that represent a hazard to
    the environment, such as the transportation of hazardous materials such as oil
    and oil products by pipeline. In fact, although extremely rare, these can lead
    to loss of containment events. An ERA model has been developed by Bonvicini et
    al. (2015) for spills from pipelines, estimating the risk of contamination both
    physically and economically. Moreover, natural disasters can also be critical
    causes of environmental accidents, and therefore, they have recently received
    much attention. In Han et al. (2019), for example, an ERA based on an analytic
    hierarchy process and fuzzy evaluation has been implemented for an industrial
    site considering typhoon disasters. As reported many years ago by Powell and Canter
    (1985), accidents in the chemical industry do not only have serious effects on
    the environment but also the well-being of many persons. Moreover, the authors
    also highlighted that human factors may influence process safety, and they developed
    a preliminary technique to include them in the risk assessment. Similarly, Schlechter
    (1996) attributed a relevant role to the management of change to ensure the safety
    of the chemical industry, and he proposed to add the Major Hazardous Installation
    Regulation to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Act 85 of 1993).
    Roy et al. (2003) then applied QRA based on the fault tree analysis technique
    and consequences analysis to the storage and purification sections within a process
    plant involving hazardous substances aiming to assess the risk to the surrounding
    population, whereas O''Mahony et al. (2008) reported a method to evaluate the
    emergency plan in case of the spreading of a toxic cloud considering a safety
    report''s worst-case scenario in terms of potential loss of life or serious health
    effects. Similar works were also carried out by Heinälä et al. (2013) and Gnoni
    and Bragatto (2013). Another interesting study on accidents and health hazards
    has been carried out by Pałaszewska-Tkacz et al. (2017), who analyzed data concerning
    chemical incidents in Poland collected in 1999–2009. Due to the high number of
    cases and fatalities, they concluded the need for a systematic analysis of hazards
    and their proper identification, such as a health risk assessment, both qualitative
    and quantitative. Hoek et al. (2018) studied the risks related to living close
    to industrially contaminated sites, and thanks to a multimedia framework, they
    discussed models applied in numerous sites in Europe and identified 10 methodologies
    helpful for the health risk assessment (i.e., CSOIL, CLEA, Atlantic RBCA, HOUGH
    Model, RISKNET, S-Risk, POPs Toolkit, RAIS, MERLIM, and INTEGRA). At the end,
    they recommended refining the exposure assessment in epidemiological studies by
    including the use of more sophisticated exposure metrics instead of simple proximity
    indicators. They also highlighted that more studies are needed to validate the
    models. Furthermore, legislation plays an important role in the protection of
    communities near major-hazard installations. Niemand et al. (2016) analyzed and
    compared the legislation in South Africa to literature and the legislation of
    other countries, suggesting the inclusion of vulnerability studies and the refinement
    of appropriate decision-making instruments such as risk assessment. Integrated
    approaches have been recently developed to include both environmental and health
    risk assessments. Jiang et al. (2012) introduced a framework able to define a
    warning area and the impact on the functional area, societal impact, and human
    health and ecology system. Then, the framework has been implemented in a decision
    tool (software on GIS platform) of real-time risk assessment on the emergency
    environmental decision support system for response to chemical spills in a river
    basin. Other models, such as ecological models, allow ecological risks of pollutants
    to ecosystems, communities, and populations to be assessed. Tavakoly Sany et al.
    (2015), for example, gave a guideline on short-term ecological risk assessment
    schemes involving dioxin chemicals and their effects on ecosystems. Frattini and
    Manning (2015) then defined an integrated environment and health risk assessment
    methodology (REHRA) based on the dramatic cyanide spill of Baia Mare (Romania).
    The methodology aims to help decision makers and authorities implement an emergency
    plan in order to reduce the integrated risk. 4 DISCUSSION Despite the fact that
    the main interest of researchers and practitioners in the field of industrial
    risk assessment for hazardous substances can be classified into five different
    clusters, the groups demonstrated close relationships and relative overlapping
    among each other. Such vicinity of the cluster themes is represented by Figure
    9, where the clusters are depicted by irregular shapes intruding into each other.
    FIGURE 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Schematic representation of the five
    different clusters and their relationship to each other The “risk assessment methods
    for Seveso sites” cluster represents the core of the literature analysis and the
    main research stream, whereas the other four clusters can be considered “satellite”
    clusters, that is, clusters that descend from the “risk assessment methods for
    Seveso sites” cluster but that have become stand-alone research streams due to
    the high interest they have attracted. For this reason, Figure 9 is represented
    as a spiral revolving around the mentioned core cluster. While “process safety
    management” and “health and environmental analysis” focus on topics that are historically
    closer and complementary to the core cluster (for this reason, they are represented
    next to it), the remaining clusters (“bow-tie diagrams and safety barriers” and
    “data-based risk assessment”) span over areas that are relatively farther from
    the center and represents an evolution toward topics that progressively extend
    the edge of industrial risk assessment for hazardous substances. Therefore, Figure
    9 provides an overview of these methodologies and research streams evolution and
    may serve as a practical basis for beginners who will start addressing such a
    multifaceted topic. Among the different papers included in the core cluster, there
    is also one of the most important reviews on the topic of risk assessment (Tixier
    et al., 2002). It is interesting to note that the main findings of this work by
    Tixier et al. (2002) still hold true: the risk assessment methodologies can still
    be described as deterministic or probabilistic and as qualitative or quantitative
    methodologies, and the risk assessment methodologies include at least one of the
    three main phases identified by Tixier et al. (2002) (i.e., identification phase,
    evaluation phase, and hierarchization phase). Moreover, the relevance of the work
    by Tixier et al. (2002) is even more evident if we consider the fact that the
    developments in the field because their work has corresponded to the crucial aspects
    and shortcomings that they had depicted. Tixier et al. (2002), for example, stressed
    the importance of the identification phase, stating that it “is essential because
    it establishes the bases of the risk analysis.” Since then, new methodologies
    have been developed to fill this gap and to properly identify the different factors
    that might affect the risk analysis, for example, DyPASI, WMCAS, and MIMAH (Delvosalle
    et al., 2006; Tugnoli et al., 2013; Wilday et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2017).
    Interestingly, in the risk assessment methodologies developed after the work by
    Tixier et al. (2002), the identification of “environment” (meant as site environment,
    topographical data, and population density), as well as its evaluation, has become
    increasingly relevant, whereas this was depicted as a lacking aspect by Tixier
    et al. (2002) (“few methods take into account the environment”). Notwithstanding
    in Section 3.1, the importance of a control strategy development for major accident
    hazards involving toxic, explosive, and flammable substances has been underlined,
    considerations of health and environmental aspects should be made. Indeed, in
    the core cluster, “environment” and “health” or “human” represent inputs of the
    risk assessment adopted for the examination of accident scenarios on the basis
    of local constraints such as, for instance, the environment composition in the
    proximity of the hazardous installations, the risk evaluation for workers or exposed
    population, or the socioeconomical context assessment. However, the concepts of
    “environment” and “health” also represent an output of the risk assessment. This
    is emphasized within “health and environmental analysis” cluster where they are
    defined as specific risk indexes referred to the safety of ecosystems and of human
    beings. Despite a different perspective, the proposed analysis showed an existing
    close correlation between these two clusters. Indeed, it is worth mentioning that
    currently, both industry and public authorities recognize the need to reduce potential
    catastrophic consequences posed by major accidents in terms of health and environmental
    outcomes becoming a critical priority. In this scenario, researchers and practitioners
    have thus focused on developing specific risk assessment methodologies that concur
    to protect ecosystems and human health from accidents, leading to the formation
    of ERA methodologies and health risk assessment methodologies, respectively (see
    Section 11). Moreover, the analysis of the core cluster also evidenced its close
    correlation with the “process safety management” cluster. As a matter of fact,
    the Seveso Directive requires putting into effect an SMS for establishments handling
    hazardous substances in the EU. As said, SMS consists of the systematic and proactive
    approach to safety risk management including organizational structures, policies,
    and procedures. Thus, it attends the implementation of methods and practices for
    hazard identification that may affect both safety and mitigation measures on the
    basis of occurrence and consequences magnitude of accident events. In particular,
    from the analysis of the cluster, it has emerged that researchers and practitioners
    have mainly focused on the development of new SMSs (more than 40 SMSs have been
    identified by Li & Guldenmund, 2018, in their review) and on their interconnections
    and integrations with risk assessment methodologies. Of particular interest is
    the latter aspect. Indeed, risk assessment and SMSs influence each other: on the
    one hand, a correct and precise risk assessment is fundamental to designing and
    implementing the correct SMSs, whereas, on the other hand, SMSs have been reported
    to represent a frequent cause of accidents. Hence, this explains the interest
    that researchers and practitioners have attributed to the integration of SMSs
    with risk analysis approaches (an example of this is the development of the I-Risk
    methodology; Papazoglou et al., 2002, 2003) considering them as complementary
    aspects for a proper safety decision-making process. As already mentioned above,
    some topics of the main cluster have been so widely investigated to constitute
    stand-alone research streams. For example, we have already shown that the works
    developed after that of Tixier et al. (2002) have highly focused on the identification
    phase (i.e., risk analysis), but in a specific case, the interest has been so
    strong that a separate cluster could be identified, that is, the “Bow-tie diagrams
    and safety barriers” cluster. This cluster groups the risk analysis methodologies
    using bow-tie diagrams as input data Tixier et al., 2002, classified them as “Plans
    or diagrams” input data) to identify the different factors affecting the risk
    analysis. In fact, bow-tie diagrams allow the major accident hazards to be identified.
    Moreover, they also allow the influence of managerial actions like the introduction
    of safety systems to be captured. Specifically, in this cluster, the SMSs here
    considered are the safety barriers, indicating that the combination of bow-tie
    diagrams and safety barriers has represented one of the main interests of researchers
    and practitioners in the last few years. Based on the analysis of the papers of
    this cluster, it has emerged that researchers and practitioners have focused on
    investigating the possibilities of combining bow-tie diagrams with other methods
    (e.g., “HAZOP,” “What if,” “FMEA”) to identify major accident hazards (Gowland,
    2006), and the results have been promising (Afefy, 2015). In some of the works
    contained in the just-mentioned clusters, it was possible to identify some hints
    of the necessity to consider the dynamic aspects of the systems where the changes
    in performance are taken into account. In the last few years, this has widely
    attracted the attention of researchers and practitioners so much to constitute
    a separated cluster, that is, the “data-based risk assessment” cluster. In fact,
    especially since the advent of Industry 4.0 technologies that allow huge amounts
    of real-time data to be accessed and managed, the risk analysis methodologies
    have experienced an evolution, moving from traditional methodologies (e.g., fault
    tree, event tree, etc.) to more advanced dynamic methodologies able to handle
    evolving conditions. In particular, from the analysis of this cluster, it has
    emerged that Bayesian approaches represent the most used techniques (alone or
    in combination with other methods, such as bow-tie approach) to consider the dynamicity
    of the systems, that is, to address time-dependent effects in risk assessment
    aiming at providing a precise estimation of emerging and increasing risks throughout
    the process lifetime. Finally, it is worth mentioning that a significant aspect
    has emerged as a common cross-cutting thread for all the identified clusters.
    The analysis of the different documents collected in this literature review revealed
    that the risk-based decision-making process has to face situations characterized
    by a state of emergence and, especially, large uncertainty. If, on the one hand,
    this has led researchers and practitioners to develop suitable approaches, techniques,
    and methods for this purpose aiming at boosting risk-oriented discipline, as pointed
    out in this work, on the other hand, the concept of knowledge and lack of knowledge
    characterizations of risk estimation is still a challenging aspect. Indeed, this
    issue has been strongly outlined by several authors over years (Aven, 2016, 2018a;
    Lathrop & Ezell, 2017; Rae et al., 2012; Suokas & Rouhiainen, 1989) creating a
    general consensus regarding the potential implications of the lack of critical
    attitude on assumptions, data, or model uncertainties for risk coping. This could
    result in imprecise risk characterization and conceptualization and a significant
    missassessment of the risk leading to a severe practical impact on the decision-making
    process. Therefore, the significance of knowledge that is gained through both
    theoretical and practical ways (for instance, through experience, informed strategy,
    testing, etc.) is crucial in narrowing the unavoidable uncertainties in the risk
    field and in how to conceptualize and govern risk. Thus, although these issues
    are not the main focus of this work, from the perspective of the present authors,
    the awareness of a proper knowledge-oriented view is a key point to meeting the
    current and future challenges for risk assessment and management. 5 CONCLUSIONS
    AND FUTURE RESEARCH In the last decades, researchers and practitioners have focused
    increasingly on risk assessment, and this has led to the development of an extensive
    number of different methodologies to systematically identify, analyze, and mitigate
    failure risks aiming at preventing major industrial accident hazards. As things
    stay today, review works trying to summarize and categorize the different risk
    assessment methodologies available are either dated or limited in scope because
    they focus only on one specific topic. The current work aims to overcome these
    drawbacks by providing an up-to-date and comprehensive overview of all risk assessment
    methodologies. Moreover, not only this work provides an up-to-date and comprehensive
    overview of all risk assessment methodologies, but it also categorizes these methodologies
    into five different clusters, which correspond to the five research streams that
    have characterized the activities of researchers and practitioners over the years,
    and identifies research advancements, emerged methodologies, recent trends, and
    perspectives in each of these clusters. Specifically, the five research streams
    that have characterized the activities of researchers and practitioners over the
    years are “Risk Assessment methods for Seveso sites,” “Bow-tie diagrams and safety
    barriers,” “Process safety management,” “Data-based risk assessment,” and “Health
    and environmental analysis,” and they have been identified by first automatically
    clustering through a novel and unsupervised machine learning technique the 559
    articles resulting from the literature analysis and then by manually cleansing.
    First, building upon this investigation, the bibliometric analysis of the collected
    documents has been carried out aiming at providing the overall picture of the
    available methodologies and research streams on risk assessment for handling hazardous
    substances within the EU industry. By investigating the distribution over time,
    as well as the publications and citation structures, it emerged an increasing
    trend of the published documents on the topic in the last 10 years. This is related
    to growing attention paid worldwide to risk and safety issues as well as to specific
    legislation requirements such as the Seveso Directives. Concerning the content
    of the collected documents, it is shown that most of them are currently focused
    on mathematical models and their application in real industrial cases. Hence,
    the continuous efforts into increasingly effective and efficient approaches and
    techniques are topics of fundamental interest both for researchers and practitioners,
    resulting also as a future direction in the field. Then, the different clusters
    have been examined by discussing the content of the most relevant selected papers
    aiming at drawing a clear picture of the research domain. The analysis of the
    reviewed articles underlined that the cluster “Risk Assessment methods for Seveso
    sites” is the most extended one, representing the research stream that catches
    the interest of researchers and practitioners the most. This cluster deals with
    the evaluation, modification, and development of risk assessment methodologies,
    and the analysis of the works contained in this cluster demonstrates how some
    critical aspects highlighted by Tixier et al. (2002) in their review are still
    current. Specifically, the risk identification and both steps of the identification
    and evaluation of such factors as site environment, topographical data, and population
    density still play a central role, and researchers and practitioners have developed
    new approaches to deal with these critical aspects, especially focusing on approaches
    that include risk assessments into the LUP process or GIS. Moreover, due to its
    relevance underlined by Seveso II [96/82/EC] and III [2003/105/EC] Directives,
    a relevant research challenge that emerged in this cluster is the domino effect.
    Concerning the other clusters, they can be considered as subclusters or satellites
    of the first one. In the “Bow-tie diagrams and safety barriers” cluster, the identified
    recent trends are mainly focused on the integration between the SMSs, considered
    as the safety barriers, and bow-tie diagrams or with other methods, such as HAZOP,
    What-if approach, and FMEA to identify major accident hazards. In the “Process
    safety management” cluster, the most interesting topic concerns the combination
    of SMSs and risk assessment approaches. Then, another cluster is the “Health and
    environmental analysis,” where the concept of environment is referred to as the
    ecosystem consisting of an output of the risk analysis. The recent progress on
    this topic led to the development of context-specific research streams such as
    ERA methodologies and health risk assessment methodologies. Finally, the last
    identified cluster is the “Data-based risk assessment” that includes the recent
    advances in risk assessment mainly related to the new digitalization processes
    and systems leading to dynamic approaches able to manage evolving conditions.
    In this regard, we consider that future research on risk assessment may be particularly
    focused on the subject related to this cluster. The advances in digitalization
    processes and systems have, in fact, led to the development of smart factories
    that rely more and more on key enabling technologies to optimize the management
    of operations. In this scenario, the opportunity of exploiting cyber-physical
    systems (CPSs) and real-time data might allow the increase in the predictability
    of risk identification to help decision makers in adopting proper intervention
    measures. The applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning hold
    great promise for enhancing the risk analysis discipline by means of the development
    of data-driven approaches. These approaches allow the analysis of big datasets
    in real time to identify patterns or leading indicators related to normal operations
    and past unwanted events with the purpose of predicting future scenarios and,
    consequently, recommending effective actions. Another emerging technology is the
    Digital Twin, that is, the digital representation of a physical system. Digital
    Twin may be adopted to simulate asset performance in live operations, improving
    operational awareness through the assessment of degradation processes, control
    strategies, maintenance activities, isolations, or failure potential consequences
    on asset health. Thus, this knowledge is useful to develop prognostic models for
    anticipating the likelihood of hazards and implementing proactive approaches to
    reduce future risk. Finally, future research may aim to address some limitations
    of this study. Indeed, the aspects that require more attention are related to
    the uncertainty encompassing all the process phases and metrics that characterized
    the risk assessment. As a matter of fact, the use of conventional hazard identification
    techniques is bound to be conditioned by subjective judgments depending on which
    method is used. This inherent limitation affects risk assessment resulting in
    inadequate hazard identification, lack of knowledge and rigor, insufficient data,
    complexity, completeness, reproducibility, and relevance of experience. These
    issues represent critical points within the risk-based discipline that result
    in increased awareness of the researchers and practitioners toward the study and
    the development of suitable methodologies, approaches, and procedures to tackle
    them. Nevertheless, also in this light, this work could be a suitable agenda that
    substantially contributes to outlining the considerable progress of risk assessment
    methodologies during the last decades discussing and categorizing the recent advancements
    within the most relevant research streams-based clusters. ACKNOWLEDGMENT Open

  description: An authentic water consumption forecast is an auxiliary tool to support
    the management of the water supply and demand in urban areas. Providing a highly
    accurate forecasting model depends a lot on the quality of the input data. Despite
    the advancement of technology, water consumption in some places is still recorded
    by operators, so its database usually has some approximate and incomplete data.
    For this reason, the methods used to predict the water demand should be able to
    handle the drawbacks caused by the uncertainty in the dataset. In this regard,
    a structured hybrid approach was designed to cluster the customers and predict
    their water demand according to the uncertainty in the dataset. First, a fuzzy-based
    algorithm consisting of Forward-Filling, Backward-Filling, and Mean methods was
    innovatively proposed to impute the missing data. Then, a multi-dimensional time
    series k-means clustering technique was developed to group the consumers based
    on their consumption behavior, for which the missing data were estimated with
    fuzzy numbers. Finally, one forecasting model inspired by Long Short-Term Memory
    (LSTM) networks was adjusted for each cluster to predict the monthly water demand
    using the lagged demand and the temperature. This approach was implemented on
    the water time series of the residential consumers in Yazd, Iran, from January
    2011 to November 2020. Based on the performance evaluation in terms of the Root
    Mean Squared Error (RMSE), the proposed approach had an acceptable level of confidence
    to predict the water demand of all the clusters.

    forecast is an auxiliary tool to support the management of the water supply and

    consumption in some places is still recorded by operators, so its database usually

    to group the consumers based on their consumption behavior, for which the missing
    data were estimated with fuzzy numbers. Finally, one forecasting model inspired
    by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks was adjusted for each cluster to predict
    the monthly water demand using the lagged demand and the temperature. This approach
    was implemented on the water time series of the residential consumers in Yazd,
    Iran, from January 2011 to November 2020. Based on the performance evaluation
    in terms of the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), the proposed approach had an acceptable
    level of confidence to predict the water demand of all the clusters. Similar content

    Time Series Model and Automatic Clustering Techniques Chapter © 2015 Introduction
    Over the years, urban water resources have gradually decreased due to such factors
    as climate change, population pressure and increasing urbanization (Hammond et
    al. 2018). On the one hand, population growth, inefficient agriculture and changing
    consumption culture have increased the urban water demand (Madani 2014). In a
    wider picture, climate change and frequent meteorological droughts have led to
    the reduction of water resources (Saemian et al. 2022). This means that the increasing
    trend of water demand is not consistent with its supply. Such an imbalance has
    caused water shortage in many areas Zaidi and Rasmani (2016). Balancing the water
    demand and supply is a difficult task and requires proper planning and efficient
    management of water supply systems. In this regard, applying assistive devices
    that are able to correctly identify the consumption patterns and the future water
    demand over different periods (i.e., short, medium, and long-term) is very beneficial
    for decision-making systems. Accurate information about the amount of future water
    needed over a given period of time helps to make informed operational, tactical
    and strategic decisions (Zanfei et al. 2022a, b). Niknam et al. (2022) categorized
    different approaches in the literature to predict future water demand. The categorization
    included artificial networks, regression, heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms,
    random forest, traditional time series and dynamic systems. To mention a few,
    Herrera et al. (2010), Vijai and Sivakumar (2018), Pesantez et al. (2020), and
    Rezaali et al. (2021) evaluated several methods, such as artificial neural networks,
    random forests, and support vector regression to predict hourly water consumption
    in urban areas. Antunes et al. (2018) used these methods as well as the k-nearest
    neighbor algorithm to predict the daily water demand based on the real data extracted
    from the Portuguese water utilities. Mousavi-Mirkalaei et al. (2022) predicted
    the urban water consumption in a city in an arid region by a Bayesian network
    and a meta-heuristic algorithm known as gene expression programming. To estimate
    the monthly water demand, Zubaidi et al. (2020) developed a hybrid model based
    on an artificial neural network and two other algorithms called backtracking search
    algorithm (BSA) and crow search algorithm (CSA). Also, Altunkaynak and Nigussie
    (2017) proposed a hybrid model based on artificial neural networks and two data
    preprocessing techniques called discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and multiplicative
    season algorithm (MSA) to predict monthly water consumption in Istanbul, Turkey.
    Candelieri (2017) applied time series clustering along with support vector regression
    to cluster water users and forecast their water consumption. Qi and Chang (2011)
    estimated the long-term municipal water demand under uncertain economic impacts
    in an urban region by system dynamics modeling. It is important to note that providing
    a high-accuracy forecasting model based on any technique or for any time period
    depends a lot on the quality of the input data. In other words, the quality of
    the output of any data-driven technique is highly sensitive to the quality and
    the quantity of its input data (Zanfei et al. 2022a, b). Therefore, preprocessing
    techniques have an important role in the implementation of the upcoming processes,
    including forecasting models (Zubaidi et al. 2020; Razavi-Far & Saif 2016). One
    problem in this regard is the existence of approximate and incomplete information
    in the collected data. Unfortunately, despite advances in technology and the existence
    of smart meters, information on the customers'' water consumption in some areas
    is still recorded once a month by operators. Hence, the collected data usually
    do not include all the required information due to some data collection problems,
    such as imperfect manual entry procedures, incorrect measurements, equipment error,
    power system failures, noise, environmental factors, and omitted entries in databases
    (Amiri & Jensen 2016; Luengo et al. 2012; Razavi-Far & Saif 2016). The incomplete
    information in the collected data is commonly known as missing data (Aristiawati
    et al. 2019). The missing data prevent to the proper analysis of the upcoming
    processes, including prediction, modeling, control, decision making, detection
    and diagnosis (Razavi-Far & Saif 2016). Therefore, a preprocessing stage in which
    the data are prepared and cleaned is needed to cope with this problem. Several
    schemes, such as ignorance, tolerance and imputation, have been studied to deal
    with the drawbacks produced by the missing values in data mining techniques. Selecting
    these schemes depends on some factors, such as the type of data. One of the best-known
    is based on preprocessing, or imputation (Luengo et al. 2012). Indeed, the imputation
    of missing data is an effective method in the data preprocessing stage and in
    designing forecasting models based on machine learning techniques. Ignoring this
    stage may cause difficulty in obtaining accurate results. Fortunately, many advances
    have been made in providing missing data imputation methods. To mention a few,
    Kim et al. (2011) proposed a method named incremental expectation maximization
    principal component analysis (iEMPCA) to estimate the missing signal values of
    electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Tang and Ishwaran (2017) studied Random
    Forest (RF) algorithms to impute various types of missing data with different
    gap percentages. Bokde et al. (2018) introduced a new method based on the Pattern
    Sequence Forecasting (PSF) algorithm that could simultaneously forecast and backcast
    missing values to impute univariate time series. El-Bakry et al. (2021) proposed
    a data imputation technique for the imputation of the missing values in time series
    data based on the fuzzy Gaussian and the fuzzy triangular membership functions.
    Some studies conducted on water consumption management have also dealt with the
    problem of missing data in the data set. For instance, García Valverde et al.
    (2015) performed classification to estimate water demand and detect suspicious
    behaviors (e.g., leaking or breaking down of meters). They mentioned that the
    missing observations were estimated through linear interpolation. As well as,
    Jun et al. (2021) compared three imputation methods, including zero, historical
    mean, and distribution sampling method to replace the missing Advanced Metering
    Infrastructure (AMI) data. They showed that the historical mean method is the
    most useful tool to impute the missing data in their data set. In another study,
    Zanfei et al. (2022a, b) analyzed the role of missing data imputation in the urban
    water demand forecasting using a set of conventional imputation algorithms, including
    linear interpolation, k-nearest neighbor, and Kalman-seasonal autoregressive integrated
    moving average (SARIMA). They tested these algorithms on three different case
    studies, then applied three machines learning techniques to predict the water
    demand. The obtained results showed that good quality imputation can significantly
    affect the forecasting results. Nonetheless, the majority of the available literature
    about water consumption forecasting models does not address the missing data problem.
    This may be because, in many of these studies, the daily or even hourly water
    consumption of users was recorded by smart meters. In some areas, there is still
    a great deal of incomplete and estimated information in datasets due to the manual
    recording of the data by operators in periods with different lengths. Therefore,
    it is necessary to provide a suitable datasets before introducing a model to forecast
    the water demand of consumers. It is not possible to determine the exact amount
    of consumption in the periods whose values are missing. Hence, an algorithm is
    needed to estimate the value of this uncertain information in an acceptable manner.
    All thing considered, this study seeks to provide a structured process involving
    several steps such as imputing the missing data, clustering the customers, and
    forecasting the monthly water demand of customers. From the practical viewpoint,
    making accurate predictions of monthly water consumption facilitates decision
    making to balance the water demand and supply in different sectors (i.e. residential,
    commercial and industrial). The proposed approach consists of several steps in
    each of which a suitable method is used according to the aim being pursued. First,
    the missing data in the water consumption series are innovatively imputed by a
    fuzzy-based algorithm. This algorithm serves to estimate the missing data with
    fuzzy numbers, thus taking the uncertainty of their value into account. Then,
    the correlation between the average monthly urban water consumption and weather
    factors is determined, and the weather factors affecting water consumption are
    identified. These factors, along with the lagged demand, are considered as predictive
    variables in the forecasting model. After the data preprocessing, time series
    clustering is done to group the consumers based on their consumption behavior.
    This reduces the variability in the datasets and, as a result, improves the accuracy
    of the forecasting model for each cluster of customers. The challenge in this
    step is that the missing data are replaced with the fuzzy numbers in the previous
    step. So, the clustering algorithm must be adjusted for the fuzzy data. To deal
    with this challenge, a multidimensional time series k-means algorithm has been
    innovatively developed to cluster the fuzzy dataset. Finally, a model is adjusted
    to predict the monthly water consumption of each cluster for the next period (i.e.
    next time step) using machine learning techniques. This is done with lagged demands
    and exogenous variables (i.e. weather factors) as predictor variables. In recent
    years, the growing popularity of machine learning algorithms, especially in the
    field of deep learning, has led to new approaches in time series prediction. The
    Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture is a type of Recurrent Neural Network
    (RNN) proposed by Hochreiter and, Schmidhuber (1997). LSTM networks have almost
    all the positive characteristics of RNNs and owing to their great learning capacity,
    have been widely used in various fields (Yu et al. 2019). In LSM networks, the
    problem of the shortcoming of a vanishing/exploding gradient during training that
    exists in the traditional RNNs and makes them unable to learn long-term dependencies
    in data has been solved. Actually, LSTM networks have the advantage that additional
    information can be directly incorporated into the model (Kühnert et al. 2021).
    Due to these advantage, the LSTM architecture was successfully developed to forecast
    problems of various time series (Du et al. 2021; Torres et al. 2022). One of those
    problems regards daily urban water demand forecasting (Hu et al. 2019; Kühnert
    et al. 2021). Accordingly, this study applies an LSTM network to predict monthly
    water demand based on water consumption time series. In order to evaluate the
    performances of the adjusted forecasting model, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
    is used as a common index of evaluation. Accordingly, the rest of this article
    is organized as follows. Sect. \"Methodology\" describes the proposed approach
    and the methods used in this approach. Sect. \"Study area and data collection\"
    is related to the study area and the collected data. Sect. \"Experimental results\"
    introduces the results of evaluating the performance of the proposed approach
    in different stages as well as the results of clustering the customers and predicting
    their consumption. Finally, Sect. \"Conclusion\" closes up the paper with the
    conclusion of the study and some suggestions for future research. Methodology
    The aim of this study is to provide a model of forecasting the water demand of
    different groups of customers based on their lagged demand and some other exogenous
    parameters affecting water consumption. It is worth to highlight that choosing
    a suitable forecasting model is the last step of the process of estimating future
    demand accurately. Various operations, such as clearing and preparing the data,
    are needed before entering this stage. In this study, a structured approach has
    been designed to perform all these processes. This section describes the details
    of the proposed approach, including its general process and the methods used during
    the stages of this process. Proposed approach In order to achieve the aim of this
    study, a hybrid approach involving several methods is proposed. The methods include
    the use of a fuzzy-based algorithm to impute the missing data, implementing a
    time series clustering technique to cluster the customers, and developing a model
    to forecast water consumption based on LSTM networks. Figure 1 shows an overview
    of the proposed approach. Fig. 1 The structure of the proposed hybrid method Full
    size image As it can be seen in Fig. 1, the proposed approach includes three main
    steps. The first step is data preprocessing, such as feature selection and the
    imputation of the missing data through the proposed algorithm. The second step
    is related to the time series clustering method used to group the consumers based
    on their consumption behavior. Lastly, the third step regards how the LSTM model
    is tuned to predict the monthly water demand of each group of the customers. The
    details of each step are presented below. A fuzzy-based algorithm to impute the
    missing data The existence of incomplete data is a natural phenomenon because
    data are usually generated, entered or collected with missing values. Time series
    data, including water consumption data, are a type of data measured, recorded
    and monitored over the time. These data usually suffer from a high percentage
    of missing values, which is related to their nature and collection process (El-Bakry
    et al. 2021). Modifying incomplete data (or missing data) leads to the increased
    accuracy of the predicted values. Several techniques, such as ignorance, tolerance
    and imputation, have been proposed in the literature to solve the missing data
    problem. Discarding or ignoring a missing value is the basis of the ignorance
    technique. The major drawbacks of this technique are the negligence of the incomplete
    patterns that cause biased estimates and the loss of efficiency. A toleration
    technique keeps the incomplete data and directly enters the missing data into
    the analyzing process without any assumptions. Imputation techniques are more
    effective and practical. The aim is to estimate the missing data with a set of
    plausible values via the knowledge in the dataset (Razavi-Far & Saif 2016). Imputing
    missing values with zero or simple statistical features, such as a mean, is a
    simple task, but it has some drawbacks. In this case, the quality of estimations
    is degraded due to the removal of some information present in instances containing
    the missing values. As for the methods based on machine learning, they are typically
    complex and need expert knowledge to determine some initial assumptions and predefine
    a stop threshold for finding the optimal value (Amiri & Jensen 2016). Based on
    the discussion above, the present study introduces a new algorithm which does
    not ignore the important features of the data and does not have the computational
    complexity of some imputation techniques. In addition, it tasks into account the
    uncertainty and vagueness of the missing data in datasets using the fuzzy set
    theory. This theory, which was developed by Zadeh et al. (1996), serves to represent
    the uncertainty in the classical set theory. According to the fuzzy theory, any
    parameter whose value is uncertain can be represented by a fuzzy number. One of
    the modes of dealing with fuzzy numbers is to display them in the form of a triangular
    fuzzy number. As shown in Fig. 2, a triangular fuzzy number \\(\\widetilde{A}\\)
    is represented by a triplet \\(\\left(l, m, u\\right)\\). Fig. 2 Representation
    of triangular fuzzy numbers (Chen 1994) Full size image The membership function
    of the mean point \\(\\left(m\\right)\\), upper boundary \\(\\left(u\\right)\\)
    and lower boundary \\(\\left(l\\right)\\) is calculated with the fuzzy theory
    as follows: $${f}_{\\widetilde{A}}\\left(x\\right)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c}\\begin{array}{c}\\frac{x-l}{m-l}
    l<x<m\\\\ \\frac{u-x}{u-m} m<x<u\\end{array}\\\\ 0 otherwise\\end{array}\\right\\}$$
    (1) A triangular fuzzy number is a very useful tool when there is ambiguity in
    information. It is clear that the value of missing data is vague and imprecise,
    so the performance of this algorithm can be improved with fuzzy numbers. According
    to the instructions of the proposed algorithm, outlier data are first removed
    considering the defined confidence interval. Then, the missing data are estimated
    by Forward Filling (FFill), Backward Filling (BFill) and Mean Filling (MeanFill)
    methods separately. Thus, three different values are obtained for the missing
    data which are the results of three mentioned methods. The FFill and BFill methods
    are commonly used to impute the missing data in time series datasets. In the FFill
    method, the missing data are replaced with the next data point, while, in the
    BFill method, they are replaced with the previous data point (Gil et al. 2020).
    A significant advantage of these two methods is the attention they pay to the
    nature of seasonal changes in time series data. Finally, the missing data are
    estimated as a fuzzy number based on the three obtained values, and their membership
    function is calculated. Figure 3 shows the general structure of the algorithm
    proposed for imputing missing data. Fig. 3 Structure of the proposed algorithm
    based on FFill and BFill methods to impute missing data in the form of fuzzy numbers
    Full size image The steps of the algorithm are delineated below. Step 1For the
    meters that have the missing data, the number of periods for which the bill has
    been issued (\\({p}_{j}\\)) and the consumption amount in each periods (\\({mc}_{i}\\))
    are recorded. \\(j=\\mathrm{1,2},\\dots ,m \\& i=\\mathrm{1,2},\\dots ,n\\) Step
    2The monthly average consumption in each period is calculated for \\({mc}_{i}\\)
    (\\({\\overline{mcp} }_{ij}\\)). Step 3The average consumption of all periods
    is calculated for \\({mc}_{i}\\) (\\({\\overline{mc} }_{i}\\)). Step 4The standard
    interval for the average consumption value of the periods is determined for \\({mc}_{i}\\)
    (\\({\\theta }_{i}\\)). \\({\\theta }_{i}= \\left[{\\overline{mc} }_{i}-3{\\sigma
    }_{i} , {\\overline{mc} }_{i}+3{\\sigma }_{i}\\right]\\) Step 5Are all the \\({\\overline{mcp}
    }_{ij}\\) s in interval \\({\\theta }_{i}\\) or not? If all the \\({\\overline{mcp}
    }_{ij}\\) s are in the range of \\({\\theta }_{i}\\), the process goes on to the
    next step. Otherwise, the \\({\\overline{mcp} }_{ij}\\) s are out of this interval
    and have the most differences from the \\({\\overline{mc} }_{i}\\) compared to
    the other \\({\\overline{mcp} }_{ij}\\) s. So, they are removed, and the process
    returns to step 3. Step 6The value of the missing data for \\({mc}_{i}\\) is estimated
    by FFill, BFill and MeanF methods called \\({\\alpha }_{k}\\), \\({\\beta }_{k}\\)
    and \\({\\gamma }_{k}\\), respectively. The value of k is equal to the number
    of the missing data for \\({mc}_{i}\\) meter (\\(k=\\mathrm{1,2},\\dots ,l\\)).
    Step 7Each missing data of \\({mc}_{i}\\) is determined by a fuzzy number as follows:
    Upper boundary (\\({U}_{i}^{k}\\)): \\(\\mathrm{Max }\\left\\{{\\alpha }_{k} ,
    {\\beta }_{k} , {\\gamma }_{k}\\right\\}\\) Midpoint (\\({M}_{i}^{k}\\)): \\(\\mathrm{Median
    }\\left\\{{\\alpha }_{k} , {\\beta }_{k} , {\\gamma }_{k}\\right\\}\\) Lower boundary
    (\\({L}_{i}^{k}\\)): \\(\\mathrm{Min }\\left\\{{\\alpha }_{k} , {\\beta }_{k}
    , {\\gamma }_{k}\\right\\}\\) Step 8The membership functions of the midpoint,
    upper boundary and lower boundary are calculated with the fuzzy theory. Step 9The
    obtained triangular fuzzy numbers are imputed for the missing data of \\({mc}_{i}\\).
    Step 10Is there another meter with the missing data or not? If there is any, the
    process returns to step 2; otherwise, the algorithm ends. Finally, in order to
    evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm, the results of imputing the
    missing data in a test dataset are compared through the proposed algorithm and
    four common indices, including mean, median, FFill and BFill. The comparisons
    are made via the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which serves as a performance
    indicator. The RMSE index is the root of the mean squared deviation of a predicted
    value from an observed one, and it is always a positive value. Hence, the lower
    the RMSE, the better the model fits the observed data. It is calculated as follows
    (Kumarana et al. 2019): $$RMSE= \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\left({y}_{i}-{\\overline{y}
    }_{i}\\right)}^{2})}$$ (2) The indices and parameters in Eq. (2) are as follows:
    n: The total number of predictions Yi: The original value Yi: The value predicted
    by the imputation model Multi-dimensional time series clustering The function
    of predictive models in complex systems is usually based on training a model with
    historical data and keeping the parameters for prediction (Kühnert et al. 2021).
    This means that the parameters are not affected by abnormal behaviors or occurrences
    (such as pipeline fractures). The closer the features of the members in the dataset,
    the better the prediction model will perform. If the behaviors of different groups
    merge together, some features (e.g., seasonal behavior) are not clearly denoted.
    That is, the patterns that originally comes from multiple sources, are combined
    into one group. Naturally, this increases the variability in the data set and
    makes it more difficult to recognize patterns. The general goal of the clustering
    algorithm is to reduce variability in datasets by maximizing the similarity within
    groups and minimizing the similarity between them. This goal also holds true about
    time series data clustering. Due to the sequential nature of time series data,
    performing operations (such as preprocessing and similarity calculation) should
    be appropriate for this type of data (Candeliri 2017). Actually, the clustering
    technique is advantageous for analyzing and summarizing the data on time series
    (Aghabozorgi et al. 2014). Different kinds of techniques and clustering algorithms
    have been proposed to cluster time series data (Kavitha & Punithavalli 2010).
    Candeliri (2017) and Pesantez et al. (2020) applied a k-means time series clustering
    technique to group water consumers according to their consumption behavior. Similarly,
    this study uses a k-means time series clustering technique. With the difference,
    the missing data are estimated in a fuzzy form. Therefore, the algorithm used
    for clustering should be developed in a way that it has the ability to cluster
    fuzzy data. The mentioned studies clustered the time series with exact data. Even
    the fuzzy clustering algorithms that were introduced can cluster deterministic
    data. For instance, Zaidi and Rasmani (2016) carried out the classification of
    domestic water consumption using the well-known Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering
    algorithm. To address this issue, the present study innovatively uses the multi-dimensional
    time series k-means algorithm offered by Giordano et al. (2021). This algorithm
    is based on the idea that each of the upper, lower and middle bounds of a fuzzy
    number is considered as one dimension. So, in this study a 3-dimensional time
    series clustering algorithm is used to cluster the customers in the dataset. In
    the proposed algorithm, \\({X}_{N}(z)\\) is a multi-dimensional time-series where
    N represents the dimensions (Giordano et al. 2021), and Z is an ordered set of
    numbers that indicate the temporal characteristics at time t (Aghabozorgi et al.
    2014). Like in other clustering algorithms, it is necessary first to define a
    similarity criterion or distance. Giordano et al. (2021) defined a generalized
    notion of distance as follows: $$d\\left({X}_{N},{Y}_{N}\\right)=\\sqrt[L]{\\sum_{n=0}^{N}\\sum_{z=0}^{Z}{\\left|{X}_{n}\\left(z\\right)-{Y}_{n}\\left(z\\right)\\right|}^{L}}$$
    (3) In Eq. (3), \\({X}_{N}(z)\\) and \\({Y}_{N}(z)\\) are two multi-dimensional
    time-series, and \\(d\\) is the generalized distance between them. In addition,
    L represents the metric distance. In this study, the \\(L\\) value (i.e., the
    Euclidean distance) is 2. In k-means clustering algorithms, clustering should
    be done for different values of the clusters (k) in order to identify a suitable
    set of patterns that represent the behavior of the clusters (Candelieri et al.
    2019). Choosing the optimal value of \\(k\\) helps to put customers with similar
    behaviors in the same cluster (i.e., internal cohesion) and separate those with
    different behaviors into different clusters (i.e., external separation). In order
    to determine the most suitable value for k, both internal cohesion and external
    separation, namely Silhouette Coefficient (SC) and Within-cluster Sums of Squares
    (WSS), have been measured. The Silhouette Coefficient score determines the optimal
    number of clusters by the difference between the average distance within the cluster
    and the minimum distance between the clusters. It is measured as follows (Wang
    & Xu 2019): $$\\overline{S }=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\left(\\frac{b\\left(i\\right)-a\\left(i\\right)}{\\mathrm{max}\\left\\{a\\left(i\\right)
    , b\\left(i\\right)\\right\\}}\\right)$$ (4) where \\(a\\left(i\\right)\\) represents
    the average distance of sample \\(i\\) to other samples in the cluster, and \\(b\\left(i\\right)\\)
    denotes the minimum distance of the sample from sample \\(i\\) to the other clusters.
    The Within-cluster Sums of Squares (WSS) measures the squared average distance
    of all the points within a cluster to the cluster center. If k is the number of
    clusters, the sum of the squared distance tends to zero when k increases (Vysala
    & Gomes 2020). It is calculated as follows: $$WSS=\\sum_{i=1}^{k}\\sum_{x\\in
    {S}_{i}}{\\Vert x-{\\mu }_{i}\\Vert }^{2}$$ (5) where \\(S=\\left({S}_{1},{S}_{2},
    \\dots , {S}_{k}\\right)\\) is a set of clusters, and \\({\\mu }_{i}\\left(i=\\mathrm{1,2},
    \\dots , k\\right)\\) is the center of cluster \\(i\\). In addition, \\({\\Vert
    x-{\\mu }_{i}\\Vert }^{2}\\) is equal to \\(\\sum {\\left(x-{\\mu }_{i}\\right)}^{2}\\)
    and showed the squared euclidian distance. All the time series regarding the monthly
    water consumption are assigned to the appropriate cluster as the optimal value
    of k is found. Then the consumption pattern of each group is identified. The patterns
    are used as the input vector in the forecasting model. Forecasting model based
    on Long Short-Term Memory networks An LSTM network is a special kind of RNN. One
    of its outstanding features is the ability to memorize beneficial information
    in the long-term memory. In other words, LSTM networks are able to consider the
    correlations within time series in both short and long terms owing to the memory
    design. This feature enables them to accurately forecast continuous data, such
    as water consumption data (Du et al. 2021). An LSTM architecture consists of several
    connected sub-networks that act as recurrent networks and a cell state that plays
    the role of the network memory. Figure 4 shows the general structure of a cell
    in an LSTM network. Fig. 4 Architecture of a cell in a long short-term memory
    network (Torres et al. 2022) Full size image As it can be seen in Fig. 4, the
    self-recurrent connections represent feedbacks with a lag of one time step. This
    recurrent network is made by a memory block. The LSTM network structure contains
    a cell and three gates, including an input gate, a forget gate and an output gate,
    which control the flow of information. The function of the cell state in the memory
    block is to keep its state over time and to adjust the information flow through
    a set of nonlinear gates. In fact, the cell state acts like a highway that moves
    information along a sequence chain. The function of the gates is to update the
    information in the cell state. Thus, during network training, they learn what
    information in the sequence is essential and what information should be kept or
    forgotten. Each LSTM cell receives the input vector at time \\(t\\) (\\({x}_{t}\\))
    and the output vector from a previous sub-network (\\({h}_{t-1}\\)) through the
    input gate, then it combines them in the forget gate through a sigmoid layer.
    The forget gate decides what information should be thrown away or kept. After
    that, the output vector \\({f}_{t}\\) is generated as follows (Torres et al. 2022;
    Du et al. 2021; Kühnert et al. 2021): $${f}_{t}= \\sigma \\left({W}_{f} . \\left[{h}_{t-1},{x}_{t}\\right]+{b}_{f}\\right)$$
    (6) A value close to 0 for \\({f}_{t}\\) means that the past information is forgotten,
    but a value close to 1 means that it remains. In the next step, \\({f}_{t}\\)
    and the information modeled from the previous cells \\(\\left({c}_{t-1}\\right)\\)
    are combined by the multiplication of the two vectors. In addition, \\({x}_{t}\\)
    and \\({h}_{t-1}\\) input vectors are passed through a sigmoid layer \\(\\left({i}_{t}\\right)\\)
    and a tangent layer \\(\\left({c}_{t}^{^{\\prime}}\\right)\\) and multiplied by
    each other. Then, the value of the current cell state (\\({c}_{t}\\)) is calculated
    as follows (Torres et al. 2022; Du et al. 2021; Kühnert et al. 2021): $${i}_{t}=
    \\sigma \\left({W}_{i} . \\left[{h}_{t-1},{x}_{t}\\right]+{b}_{i}\\right)$$ (7)
    $${c}_{t}^{^{\\prime}}= tanh \\left({W}_{c} . \\left[{h}_{t-1},{x}_{t}\\right]+{b}_{c}\\right)$$
    (8) $${c}_{t}= {f}_{t} . {c}_{t-1}+ {i}_{t} . {c}_{t}^{^{\\prime}}$$ (9) The memory
    state \\(\\left({c}_{t}\\right)\\) evaluates the new input information and determines
    what information to throw away or maintain. In the last step, it is determined
    which output vector will be the input vector of the next hidden unit (\\({h}_{t}\\)).
    For this purpose, an output gate passes the input vectors \\({x}_{t}\\) and \\({h}_{t-1}\\)
    through a sigmoid layer \\(\\left({o}_{t}\\right)\\) and adds them to the information
    in the current cell state \\(\\left({c}_{t}\\right)\\). Then, the result of the
    output gate \\(\\left({o}_{t}\\right)\\) is passed through a tangent layer, and
    the final output \\({h}_{t}\\) is obtained as follows (Torres et al. 2022; Du
    et al. 2021; Kühnert et al. 2021): $${o}_{t}= \\sigma \\left({W}_{o} . \\left[{h}_{t-1},{x}_{t}\\right]+{b}_{o}\\right)$$
    (10) $${h}_{t}= {o}_{t} . \\mathrm{tanh}({c}_{t})$$ (11) where the weights and
    the biases assigned to the gates are represented by w and b, \\({w}_{f}\\), \\({w}_{i}\\)
    and \\({w}_{o}\\) parameters and \\({b}_{f}\\), \\({b}_{i}\\) and \\({b}_{o}\\)
    parameters are the weight matrices and the bias items of the forget gate, input
    gate and output gate, respectively. In addition, \\({w}_{c}\\) and \\({b}_{c}\\)
    are the weight and the bias of the cell state (Du et al. 2021). The proper weights
    (w) and biases (b) should be determined at each stage of learning in order to
    improve the performance of neural networks, including LSTM. For this purpose,
    an objective function known as loss function or cost function is applied to update
    the weights and biases as well as display the error rate in each time of running
    the training data. Various functions have been introduced as the loss function
    in the literature. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is a practical function
    frequently used as a loss function. It is a relative measure that reports errors
    as the percentages of actual values. It evaluates the prediction accuracy of a
    model based on the average of the absolute value of deviation between the observed
    and the predicted values standardized by its division over the observed value,
    as follows (Bata et al. 2020): $$\\mathrm{MAPE}=\\frac1n{\\textstyle\\sum_{i=1}^n}\\left|\\frac{Y_t-F_t}{Y_t}\\right|$$
    (12) The lower the MAPE value, the better the forecast is. So, learning algorithms
    seek to minimize error values. Moreover, to evaluate the accuracy of the predicted
    value by any type of forecasting model (e.g., a variety of neural networks), it
    is necessary to evaluate the performance of the models. Various indicators have
    been introduced in the water demand forecasting literature. The root mean squared
    error (RMSE) and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are the most widely
    applied for this purpose (Niknam et al. 2022). These index are used in the present
    study to evaluate the performance of the forecasting model. The RMSE indicator
    is the root of the mean squared deviation of a value predicted from an observed
    one. It is always a positive value. So the lower the RMSE and the MAPE, the better
    the model fits the observed data. Study area and data collection The proposed
    approach was implemented on a real dataset about the monthly water consumption
    in a city located in an arid area. This section describes the study area in terms
    of demographics and weather conditions as well as the data and the preliminary
    analysis that was performed to prepare them. Case study The data used in this
    study belonged to approximately 175848 residential consumers in Yazd, Iran. Iran
    is located in an arid and semi-arid region of the world. Severe droughts have
    recently posed a major challenge to water resources management in this country
    (Nejadrekabi et al. 2022). Yazd is one of the water-scarce cities of Iran located
    in a wide and dry valley at the coordinates of 15°53´-40°54´ E and 46°31´-15°32´
    N. It covers an area of around 2,397 Km2, and its altitude is 1230 m above sea
    level. Its average annual temperature is approximately 24 °C, and the average
    annual precipitation is from 50 to 60 mm. In terms of droughts, this city is known
    as the driest provincial center in Iran. Due to the droughts in recent years and
    the vital role of water in urban growth and development, water scarcity has become
    a threat to the continuation of life in this area. Therefore, planning to supply
    water for the city is a major concern of the urban authorities. In order to predict
    the water demand in this area, some data were collected on the historical water
    consumption or the lagged demand of the residential consumers and the status of
    the climate parameters over ten years from January 2011 to November 2020. The
    monthly water consumption of the consumers was extracted from the bills issued
    by Yazd Water and Sewerage Organization. As Niknam et al. (2022) mentioned, there
    is evidence in the literature for a correlation between water consumption and
    weather factors, such as temperature. The temperature dataset used in this study
    included maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin), and average temperature
    (Tave). It was obtained from the synoptic station of Yazd Meteorological Organization.
    Dataset preparation Firstly, a Box & Whiskers plot was applied to identify the
    outliers and smooth the water dataset. The outlier data were excluded from the
    dataset based on the Whiskers intervals for each month. Then, the time series
    diagram of the lagged water demand was drawn to investigate the monthly water
    consumption trend of the residential customers in Yazd over the studied years.
    Figure 5a presents the Box & Whiskers plot of the total monthly water consumption
    of those consumers. Also, Fig. 5b shows the time series diagram of the monthly
    water consumption trend in Yazd during the studied period. Fig. 5 (a) The Box
    & Whiskers plot of the monthly water consumption of the residential consumers,
    (b) the time series diagram of the monthly water consumption trend in Yazd during
    the studied period Full size image Based on Fig. 5a, the highest consumption occurs
    in June, July and August, which are the hottest months of the year, and the lowest
    consumption is for November, December, January and February, as the coldest months
    of the year. This consumption trend seems to be quite normal, but some outliers
    are also observed in the figure. The outlier points are mainly related to the
    consumption of the early 2011 and the late 2020. The data taken from some meters
    in this period were incomplete. For this reason, the total consumption of Yazd
    calculated for the mentioned months was less than the actual amount. The outlier
    points were excluded from the studied period to avoid their influence on the reported
    results. As it can also be seen in Fig. 5b, more water is consumed in hot than
    in cold months, which is quite reasonable, but the trend of consumption is nearly
    upward. In other words, the total consumption of the city increased during these
    years, which currently needs to be managed and controlled. As mentioned, the temperature
    factor has been repeatedly introduced in the literature as one of the most important
    climate factors affecting water demand and consumption. The effect of this parameter
    on water consumption was investigated in this study too. For this purpose, the
    Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC) was calculated for the temperature factor
    and the average monthly water consumption. Table 1 presents the monthly statistics
    of the Tmax, Tmin, and Tave in degrees Celsius (\\(^\\circ{\\rm C}\\)) in Yazd
    from January 2011 to November 2020. The table also reports Pearson’s coefficients
    for the correlation of these factors and the average monthly water consumption.
    Table 1 The statistics for the climatic factors in Yazd from January 2011 to November
    2020 Full size table According to the results presented in Table 1, the average
    temperature (Tave) factor with the coefficient of 0.915656 has the highest positive
    correlation with the average monthly water consumption (Consave). Of course, the
    other factors have a significant correlation with water consumption too. Therefore,
    it is necessary to check the correlation among these factors. Figure 6 displays
    the correlations of these factors. Fig. 6 The scatter plot of the correlations
    among the climatic factors and the water consumption Full size image Based the
    Fig. 6, it is clear that the relationship between the average monthly temperature
    (Tave) and the average monthly water consumption (Consave) is positive and linear.
    The relationship between the temperatures factors also looks positive and linear.
    This means that the temperature factors are not independent of each other. Therefore,
    in order to avoid multi-collinearity, one of them must be selected as an independent
    variable for the forecasting model. Multi-collinearity occurs in the model when
    the factors that enter the model as independent variables are not independent
    of one another. This makes the results of the prediction model invalid. According
    to this explanation, the average monthly temperature, which had the highest correlation
    with the average monthly water consumption, was selected as the input variable
    in the forecasting model. Experimental results This section reports the results
    of implementing the proposed process on the dataset. It is divided into several
    subsections about imputing the missing data with a fuzzy-based algorithm, clustering
    the consumers based on their behavior, and adjusting a prediction model for each
    cluster of consumers. All the steps of the proposed process have been implemented
    in Python 3.8.9 and by using some of its libraries, including Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib,
    Sklearn, Tensorflow, Keras, Math, Seaborn, Datetime, Random, SciPy, Warnings,
    and Tslearn. Imputing the missing data with the proposed algorithm In this study,
    a fuzzy-based algorithm has been developed to impute the missing data in the water
    consumption time series in term of triangle fuzzy numbers. Before the imputation
    of the missing value in the dataset, the performance of the proposed algorithm
    was evaluated in terms of the RMSE index. For this purpose, the results of imputing
    the missing data through the proposed algorithm were compared to the results of
    using four traditional indices (i.e., mean, median, FFill and BFill) in a test
    dataset. To this end, first, 50 m with no missing values were randomly selected.
    Then, their consumption values in 10%, 20% and 30% of the periods were randomly
    removed. The removed values were considered as the missing data in the test dataset.
    The data imputing process was repeated 50 times to ensure the performance of the
    algorithm and its convergence. Table 2 presents the RMSE values obtained for the
    mentioned indices in all the three datasets. Table 2 The RMSE value for different
    methods of imputing the missing data Full size table Based on the results presented
    in Table 2, the average value of RMSE for the proposed algorithm (i.e., FuzzyM)
    is lower than that for the other methods in all the three test dataset. Also,
    the minimum RMSE value (i.e., the RMSE value for the best solution), the maximum
    RMSE value (i.e., the RMSE value for the worst solution), and the lower and upper
    limits of the 95% confidence interval for the proposed algorithm are lower than
    the corresponding values in the other methods. Based on these results, it is obvious
    that the estimation of the missing data using the proposed algorithm was closer
    to the reality compared to the other methods. Figure 7 shows the Box & Whiskers
    plot of the RMSE values for the various methods of imputing the missing data.
    Fig. 7 The Box & Whiskers plot of the RMSE values for the methods of imputing
    the missing data Full size image As it can be seen in Fig. 7, the RMSE value for
    the proposed algorithm in terms of the minimum, median, average, first quartile
    and third quartile is at a lower level than that in the other methods, which shows
    its better performance. This conclusion is clearly denoted in Fig. 7. Figure 8
    shows the dot plot of the difference value between the actual value and the estimated
    value of the missing data in cubic meter (\\({m}^{3}\\)) for the proposed fuzzy
    algorithm (FuzzyM). Fig. 8 The difference value of the actual data vs. the imputed
    data with FuzzyM method Full size image In Fig. 8, the horizontal axis and the
    vertical axis denote the difference value between the actual values and the estimated
    values in cases where that value is positive and negative, respectively. Therefore,
    the closer the points are to the x = y line, the smaller the difference between
    the actual value and the estimated value. With this interpretation, it is clear
    that the proposed fuzzy algorithm has a good performance to estimate the missing
    data. Thus, imputing the missing value of the time series for the water consumption
    of the residential customers in the studied area was done via the proposed algorithm
    based on the fuzzy theory. Clustering of the water consumption time series A multi-dimensional
    time-series k-means clustering algorithm was developed to cluster the residential
    consumers based on their monthly water consumption. With that algorithm, clustering
    was performed for different \\({k}_{i}\\) numbers \\((i=2, 3, \\dots , 10)\\),
    and suitable values of k were selected based on SC scores and WSS indices. Table
    3 presents the results of applying these scores and indices for \\({k}_{i}(i=2,
    3,\\dots ,10)\\). Table 3 The SC scores and WSS indices Full size table According
    to Table 3, as \\({k}_{i}\\) increased, the corresponding SC and WSS decreased.
    The lower the value of WSS, the lower the dispersion was within the clusters and,
    conversely, the higher the value of SC, the better the quality of clustering.
    So, there had to be a trade-off between the values of WSS and SC. For this purpose,
    both indices were investigated for different k values in the form of a Pareto
    chart. It was drawn for the silhouette coefficient scores and the normalized within-cluster
    sum of squares in a plot to find the optimal value of k. Figure 9 shows the plot
    of the SC scores and the normalized WSS values for \\({k}_{i}(i=\\mathrm{2,3},\\dots
    ,9)\\). Fig. 9 The SC scores vs. the normalized WSS values for \\({k}_{i}(i=\\mathrm{2,3},\\dots
    ,9)\\) Full size image Based on the results shown in Fig. 9, \\(\\mathrm{k}=2\\)
    was the optimal number for the clustering of the residential consumers based on
    the SC scores. As \\({k}_{i}\\) increased, the WSS value decreased. Actually,
    WSS had to be low while SC was kept at a reasonable value. Therefore, an elbow
    plot was used to find the optimal value of k. As the WSS (or the normalized WSS)
    started to flatten out and form an elbow shape, the k value was selected. Accordingly,
    \\(k=5\\) was chosen as the suboptimal solution. This means that the consumption
    trend of the residential consumers in Yazd during the studied period generally
    followed five patterns. Figure 10 presents this trend along with the consumption
    patterns of the consumers based on their average monthly water consumption for
    each cluster. Fig. 10 (a) The consumption trend during the studied period and
    (b) the monthly consumption pattern for each cluster Full size image Figure 10a
    shows the consumption trend of each cluster during the studied period based on
    the average consumption of the consumers in that cluster. The customers who had
    similar consumption behaviors were clustered together, and, thus, the hidden knowledge
    of the customers'' consumption patterns was discovered. Based on this knowledge,
    it was clear which cluster each customer belonged to. As a result, it was easier
    to plan and manage the consumption of the customers according to their behavior
    in clusters. According to Fig. 10b, average temperature and water consumption
    are positively correlated. These changes are well observed according to the climate
    of the region in different seasons of the year, especially in summer and winter.
    Normally, with an increase in temperature throughout the year, the amount of water
    consumption increases, and with a decrease in temperature, the amount of consumption
    decreases. All these changes are not related to regular daily habits, but some
    of them are also affected by changing needs in different seasons. For example,
    using water coolers and irrigating gardens with drinking water significantly increases
    water consumption in hot months. In this study, the consumption patterns of all
    the clusters followed a nearly normal trend; the lowest water consumption was
    in January and February, as the coldest months of the year. In March, although
    it gets warmer, the consumption trend first increased and then decreased. This
    abnormal change in the trend could be due to the beginning of the New Year in
    Iran in March and the higher consumption during the New Year’s holidays. Then,
    the consumption went up until it reached its highest level in July, which is the
    hottest month of the year. After that, the consumption trend began to fall gradually
    as the temperature decreased. Table 4 reports the percentage of the consumers
    belonging to each cluster and some statistical features of their consumption in
    cubic meters (\\({m}^{3}\\)). Table 4 The statistics related to the consumption
    of each cluster in cubic meter Full size table According to the statistics provided
    by the Water and Sewerage Organization, the per capita consumption of water by
    the residential meters in the city of Yazd is about 11.7464 to 13.5536 cubic meters
    (\\({m}^{3}\\)) per month. Naturally, this consumption rate has been determined
    based on the amount of population, the urban or rural of the area, and the type
    of geographical zone. A comparison of the declared per capita consumption statistics
    with the data presented in Table 4 indicates that only cluster 3 (50.17% of the
    cases) with the average consumption of 12.5518 (\\({m}^{3}\\)) is within the normal
    range. Although the highest percentage of consumers is in this cluster, a large
    percentage of customers are still in clusters with higher consumption. This problem
    is especially true about cluster 0 (40.57% of the cases). The average consumption
    of residents in this cluster is 22.6860 (\\({m}^{3}\\)). The existence of a large
    percentage of customers in this cluster makes the water consumption in the city
    significantly higher than normal. This group of consumers has the potential for
    the water organization to turn them into a cluster with lower consumption by applying
    management techniques such as incentive offers or improved technology (e.g., installing
    the reducing equipment). The other clusters, especially clusters 4 (0.17% of the
    cases) and 1 (0.1% of the cases), have extremely high water consumption. Although
    the number of the members in these two clusters is insignificant compared to the
    other clusters, the organization should take serious measures to reduce their
    consumption. Some of these consumers live in apartments whose meters are not separate.
    The number of households with such joint meters is high enough for the water managers
    to separate these type of meters. Forecasting the water consumption of the clusters
    After clustering procedure, one model inspired by LSTM networks was developed
    to predict the average monthly water consumption (Consave) of each cluster. The
    adjusted LSTM model predicted the Consave at the next time step using two predictor
    variables including the lagged water demand and the average temperature. In addition
    to the lagged water demand, the temperature parameter is also entered into the
    prediction model as a predictor variable. Therefore, the prediction model appears
    in the form of a multivariate LSTM model. A principle to consider before using
    a deep learning model, such as the LSTM model, is the optimal adjustment of the
    model''s hyper-parameters. These parameters have significant effects on the accuracy
    of prediction. Hence, in this study, sensitivity analyses were initially performed
    to optimally tune those hyper-parameters. These hyper-parameters included the
    time steps of the input variables, the number of the units in the layers, the
    dropout rate, the batch size, and the percentage of training and testing data.
    For this purpose, hyper-parameters of the model were tuned by the minimization
    of the RSME index. Table 5 reports the changes in the prediction errors (i.e.,
    the RMSE value) versus the hyper-parametric changes in the training and test datasets.
    Table 5 Sensitivity analysis of hyper-parameters in the LSTM model Full size table
    Based on the results reported in Table 5, the optimal values of time steps, units
    (or neurons), dropout rate and batch size were 3, 100, 0.2 and 1, respectively.
    These values are bold in the table. Regarding the best data separation percentages
    for the training and test sets, the ranges of 20%-80% and 30%-70% were obtained.
    Therefore, both modes can be chosen. The range of values considered in this study
    is 20%-80%. There were also two hidden layers, the training epochs were set to
    2000, and the model was run for all the clusters. Figure 11 shows the loss function
    value of the model for each cluster. Fig. 11 The value of the loss function for
    each cluster in the LSTM model Full size image It is evident from Fig. 11 that
    the loss function values in all the models approximately started from 40% in the
    first period and reached below 5% in the last period. The performance and the
    convergence of the models indicated that the MAPE is a proper index with which
    to form a forecasting model. After the LSTM model was adjusted, the monthly average
    water consumption of each cluster was predicted and the results were evaluated
    in terms of the forecasting error (i.e. RMSE and MAPE). Due to the stochastic
    nature of LSTM models, this process was performed five times for each model to
    ensure that the results would not be random. Table 6 reports the average RMSE
    and MAPE associated with each forecasting model. Table 6 The average value of
    error (RMSE and MAPE) associated with each forecasting model Full size table Based
    on the results reported in Table 6, the average value of RMSE in five implementations
    of the program for all the models was less than 0.01575 and 0.07904 for the train
    dataset and the test dataset, respectively. Similarly, the average value of MAPE
    in five implementations of the program for all the models was less than 1.88%
    and 11.92% for the train dataset and the test dataset, respectively. These values
    are bold in the table. These results indicate that the adjusted models had an
    acceptable level of confidence. In other words, the LSTM models were well-trained
    for proper water consumption. Figure 12 shows the diagrams that compare the observed
    and the predicted average monthly water consumption values for each cluster during
    the studied period. Fig. 12 Comparison of the actual and the predicted values
    for the average monthly water consumption Full size image Hence, the models proposed
    in this study can serve to predict the monthly water consumption of different
    groups of residential customers. They also help to plan to meet the water demand
    in Yazd in different months of the year. Conclusion This paper proposes a structured
    approach in a step-by-step procedure to predict the monthly water demand at each
    next time step based on the consumption patterns of residential customers. The
    collected data consisted of the lagged or previously observed water demand, and
    the effects of weather factors on the water consumption were determined by correlation
    analyses. Due to the existence of approximate and incomplete information in the
    dataset, an innovative algorithm was developed based on the fuzzy theory to impute
    the missing data. Then, the residential customers were grouped by a modified multi-dimensional
    time series k-means clustering algorithm, and a forecasting model inspired by
    the LSTM network was adjusted for each group. Adjusting the forecasting model
    based on the consumption patterns was advantageous because it helped to achieve
    a more reliable method of measurement. To this end, the variability in the datasets
    was reduced through grouping the consumers and creating a separate model for each
    group. As the experiential results showed, the proposed approach is able to make
    robust and reliable predictions in a step-by-step manner with acceptable performance
    for different groups of customers despite the existence of incomplete and estimated
    data in the dataset. To cope with the data problem, an innovative algorithm was
    presented for the estimation of the missing data in the form of fuzzy numbers.
    The results in terms of RMSE showed that the proposed algorithm performs better
    than traditional imputing methods such as FFill and BFill and using means and
    medians. Due to the fuzziness of the consumption values in some periods, a clustering
    algorithm based on the multi-dimensional time series k-means method was developed
    to cluster the customers and extract their consumption patterns. The consumption
    behavior of the customers was found to be of five general patterns. Although the
    trend of these patterns seemed normal (i.e., more consumption in hot months and
    less in cold months), the consumption trends of the city was approximately upward.
    This is despite the fact that the precipitation decreases every year and the level
    of underground water goes down. Therefore, it is needed to plan strategies to
    manage the consumption in different clusters. Actually, there is an annual increase
    in the consumption, while there is no increase in the resources. Perhaps, the
    only way to meet the demand of the next years is to properly change the consumption
    pattern of the customers. Finally, a model inspired by the LSTM network was tuned
    to predict the water consumption in the next time step. This was done by the use
    of the lagged demand and the temperature for each cluster. The loss function of
    all the tuned models decreased and converged at a reasonable speed. Indeed, the
    average RMSE value of all the models was less than 0.014837 and 0.0786756 for
    the train dataset and the test dataset, respectively. This gives an acceptable
    level of confidence to use adjusted models to predict monthly water consumption
    and plan for meeting the water demand of residential customers in Yazd. The rising
    trend of water consumption is worrying and requires proper and comprehensive planning.
    Future studies can concentrate on designing various scenarios in different conditions
    and evaluate the effectiveness of those scenarios under uncertainties. It is also
    suggested to use different approaches of treating uncertainty, such as fuzzy theory
    and robust theory, to evaluate the performance of forecasting models in various
    scenarios. Data availability Not applicable. References Aghabozorgi S, Ying Wah

  description: The deterioration of water pipes causes significant socio-economic
    and environmental burdens. Many predictors/factors are used to mitigate such problems
    by modelling the water pipe deterioration. However, these predictors have not
    been thoroughly investigated in the literature. This study adopts mixed systematic
    and scientometric analyses to review the predictors used in modelling water pipe
    deterioration. Within the study context, the predictors are categorised into pipe-related,
    soil and corrosion-induced, operational, and environmental. The results reveal
    that the pipe-related predictors have received the most attention in the reviewed
    studies, whereas further investigations are required to study long-term changes
    in the environmental-induced predictors. Accordingly, future research directions
    are recommended to fill these gaps (e.g., considering sustainability issues, and
    deploying real-time monitoring, and IoT facilities to enhance data availability.
    These directions greatly benefit practitioners and researchers from multidisciplinary
    backgrounds in research directions related to water pipes.

    degradation, which reduces its structural and hydraulic capacities in resisting
    external and internal loads subjected to the WDNs. The deterioration rate reflects
    the condition and performance of WDNs. Continuous assessment of WDNs condition
    is one of the measures for determining deterioration and is required to monitor
    and predict its remaining service life. Similarly, water pipes'' failure rates
    and probability or breakdown time are utilised to measure the deterioration. Water
    pipes'' performance is typically measured by service quality or the use of resources
    [122]. Besides, water pipe performance is mainly affected by the failure rate,
    which measures the WDNs deterioration. Hence, reducing the failure rates is necessary
    to sustain the performance of WDNs [119]. Fig. 1 shows the connection between
    water pipe performance measurement, condition assessment, and deterioration modelling.

    Fig. 1. Interconnection among deterioration modelling with performance measurement
    and condition assessment. Water pipe deterioration has severe socio-economic and
    environmental impacts. Araujo et al. [10] claimed that water loss in drinking
    water systems exceeds 30% due to several reasons, including deterioration. A recent
    European report quantified the water loss as 25 to 50% [53]. These percentages
    were estimated considering deterioration, leakage, burst losses, and non-revenue
    uses, such as water used for institutions, maintenance, street-cleaning, firefighting,
    etc. Fig. 2 shows that Europe''s average annual water loss reaches 23%, including
    almost 50% in Ireland and about 40% in Italy [36]. Download : Download high-res
    image (280KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Average distribution
    of European water losses [36]. Given these facts, WDNs require continuous monitoring
    to effectively model their deterioration and sustain their performance. This monitoring
    includes measurements, laboratory inspections, and data collection, which are
    required to predict the four deterioration measures, as shown in Fig. 1. Currently,
    nine review papers have considered water pipe deterioration from different perspectives,
    all of which focus on modelling techniques. Table 1 summarises the existing review
    papers on the deterioration of water pipes. Rajani and Kleiner [94] reviewed some
    physical models focusing on mechanical and hydraulic properties. A companion paper
    by the same authors discusses three categories of statistical models, i.e., deterministic,
    single variate, and multivariate probabilistic [68]. Later developments have also
    incorporated studies implementing artificial intelligence into the deterioration
    modelling process. For instance, Cole and Marney [22] considered the pipe deterioration
    modelling as a step in assessing pipe condition by adding two more sections into
    the statistical models of Kleiner and Rajani [68] to review the utilisation of
    artificial neural networks and fuzzy models for water pipe failure prediction.
    Dawood et al. [28,29] reviewed artificial intelligence applications for the deterioration
    modelling process of studies between 2001 and 2019. Since deterioration is one
    of the pipe failure causes, failure prediction models have also been reviewed
    in several articles such as Dawood et al. [28,29], Nishiyama and Filion [90],
    Scheidegger et al. [107], and Nishiyama and Filion [90]. Ge and Sinha [42] presented
    a state-of-the-art review on prestressed-concrete cylinder pipes. Lastly, Wilson
    et al. [128] reviewed the deterioration models of large-sized water pipes. Table

    have mainly focussed on the modelling techniques. However, the prediction models''
    accuracy depends on the availability and quality of data, and the number of significant
    predictors adopted [16,113]. To the best of the authors'' knowledge, studies reviewing
    these predictors and how they are used in the literature are scarce. Although
    previous review papers discuss the data required for each model, the effect of
    each predictor on the pipe deterioration modelling should be investigated. Accordingly,
    this review paper is dedicated to filling the knowledge gaps left by the existing
    review articles. Within the study context, a bibliometric survey, scientometric
    analysis, and mixed systematic-binary response are adopted to conduct a thorough
    literature review. Moreover, an in-depth analysis of each water pipe deterioration
    modelling predictor is provided by utilising a mixed systematic-binary response
    statistic to summarise criticises and provide numerical clues for efficiently
    assessing each predictor/factor in certain processes. Lastly, insightful recommendations,
    future research directions, and potential challenges are presented to achieve
    sustainable development goals. These points are essential in helping multidisciplinary
    researchers establish a strong stream in the coming years. The rest of this paper
    is organised as follows: section 2 discusses the methodology of this study. The
    detailed steps of the bibliometric survey are described in section 3, while section
    4 contains the scientometric analysis procedure and its results. Furthermore,
    sections 5 and 6 present the mixed systematic-binary response review and future
    directions and challenges, respectively. Finally, section 7 discusses the conclusions
    and summary of this research. 2. Research methodology In this study, a three-level
    review approach was adopted to review the literature on modelling water pipe deterioration
    and address the utilisation of technical and environmental predictors. Generally,
    an integrated scientometric-systematic review approach was proposed by Hussein
    et al. [52] with binary response statistics. Fig. 3 illustrates the methodology
    of the three-level review article, which includes: i. A bibliometric survey “bounded
    by the orange dash line”. ii. A scientometric analysis. iii. A mixed systematic
    review-binary response statistics “bounded by the red dash line”. Download : Download

    of the review methodology. Relevant keywords in different combinations were selected
    to serve as search input terms in at least one scientific database, such as Scopus
    and Web of Science (WoS). The search results were merged, and then a snowballing
    technique was conducted. The resulting research articles'' list marked the end
    of the first level, i.e., the bibliometric survey. The output of the bibliometric
    survey was used as an input to the scientometric and systematic reviews. Thereafter,
    knowledge gaps in the existing review studies conducted on the same subject were
    identified. The identified gaps formed the basis of this research. After that,
    relevant data matching the characteristics of the proposed review were extracted
    from the shortlisted studies. Typically, in systematic-scientometric reviews,
    the results from both analyses are usually compared and refined until a good match
    is found [52]. However, since this review examined the predictors of water pipe
    deterioration, a binary response statistic was added to the review process. The
    binary response statistic was used to collect and identify all the predictors
    used in the existing literature. Therefore, additional steps were added to extract
    these predictors as used in the modelling process. Then, the predictors were grouped
    and utilised to run the binary response statistic (see section 5.1). The final
    results provided some important numerical conclusions, which are of value to both
    academics and practitioners. The binary response statistic is discussed in detail
    in section 5.1. 3. Bibliometric survey The bibliometric survey is a crucial element
    during the preparation of any literature review process [52]. In this work, this
    aspect is delineated by the orange dash line in Fig. 1 and summarised in the following
    steps: 3.1. Keyword selection Keyword selection is crucial in identifying the
    most relevant documents on a research topic. In this study, the scope focuses
    on water pipe deterioration. Thus, the selected keywords are “water main, water
    pipe, water distribution networks, and deterioration” 3.2. Search process in scientific
    databases Fig. 3 shows that the keywords were applied to search for relevant publications
    in the Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases (see Fig. 3). As of October 2021,
    271 and 131 documents were found in Scopus and WoS, respectively. The search results
    from these databases were filtered by setting some exclusion and inclusion criteria.
    3.3. Setting inclusion and exclusion criteria These criteria were used to refine
    the search results from the two databases. Table 2 shows each database''s criteria
    for the subject area, document type, and research language search fields. Generally,
    the search resulted in 226 documents in Scopus and 128 documents in WoS. Table

    file (CSV), and the duplicated cells were removed. The data in this file consisted
    of the articles'' full records, including their titles, abstracts, keywords, authors
    list, etc. Based on the titles and abstracts of the studies, a review cycle was
    conducted to eliminate irrelevant studies, resulting in 244 documents (135 articles,
    100 conference papers, and 9 reviews). Snowballing was also utilised to retrieve
    more relevant articles. 3.5. Snowballing Forward and backward snowballing techniques
    were executed. In the forward snowballing process, the reference list of each
    document in the CSV file was searched to find other relevant articles. Conversely,
    backward snowballing was done by tracking the citation list of each document to
    retrieve other relevant articles. Consequently, 31 new articles were identified,
    which brought the total number of articles to 275. The data of these studies were
    subsequently used for scientometric analysis. 4. Scientometric analysis The output
    of the bibliometric survey, as described in the last section, was used for the
    scientometric analysis. This analysis applies science mapping and text mining
    to visualise bibliometric survey data regarding the co-occurrence of keywords,
    co-authorship, and co-citation [50]. It is noteworthy that this study is the first
    to conduct a scientometric analysis in the water pipe deterioration modelling
    domain. Several science mappings software packages, such as CiteSpace [19] and
    VOSviewer [120], can be used for scientometric analysis. As shown in Fig. 3, VOSveiwer
    was selected to analyse and visualise the mapping network of the retrieved documents''
    keywords co-occurrence. As described earlier, the CSV file contains the documents''
    titles, abstracts, keywords, and authors list. Indeed, the publication criteria
    vary from one publisher to another. Therefore, differences may occur in, for example,
    the names'' arrangement or representation (the author''s initials with surname
    versus the author''s full name) and keywords (author-supplied keywords versus
    publisher''s keywords). These variations may generate misleading co-author or
    co-citation analysis results. Therefore, OpenRefine 2.0, an open-source software
    powered by Google, was used to curate the data [121]. 4.1. Scientometric results
    4.1.1. Annual publication trends Based on the bibliometric survey results, Fig.
    4 shows the publication trend of the annual studies on modelling the water pipelines''
    deterioration. It can be seen that the first articles in this field were published
    in 1977, while no significant increase is seen in the number of articles over
    the subsequent years, and no article was retrieved between 1997 and 2000. In 2001,
    two review articles on the statistical and physical deterioration models of water
    pipelines were published [68,94]. These two review papers motivated the growth
    seen in modelling water pipe deterioration. The annual publication trend has continued
    to rise since 2001, peaking at around 19 publications in 2016. This growing trend
    in the studies of water pipes'' deterioration reveals the importance of this topic.
    In this context, many keywords have been used to represent these studies. The
    following section discusses the mapping network analysis of these keywords. Download

    Annual publication trends on the modelling of deterioration of water pipelines.
    The annual publication trends do not reflect the importance of such research topics
    in different territories. Therefore, it is essential to identify the contributions
    of countries/territories in this research topic. Fig. 5 depicts the number of
    publications in the top contributing countries/ territories. It can be seen that
    Canada and the United States are the top contributors to the modelling of water
    pipelines'' deterioration in North America and globally, whereas Australia is
    the top contributor in Oceania and the third globally. Saudi Arabia, North Korea,
    and China are the most publishing countries in Asia. The United Kingdom and Egypt
    are the top contributing countries in Europe and Africa, respectively. Download

    Top contributing countries. 4.2. Keyword analysis Keyword mapping shows critical
    research interests in the study area. Such a mapping network illustrates the connections
    between different keywords used in a specific topic. In addition, the network
    provides, at a glance, minor research problems, factors, or parameters that might
    impact the research topic, modelling techniques, and solution methods. Such networks
    can be used to build a preliminary research gap. In this research, the total number
    of keywords in the bibliometric CSV file is 2500. Within this file, only 314 keywords
    have been used at least three times in the literature. As mentioned earlier, these
    data were curated using OpenRefine 2.0, resulting in 2094 keywords. Of these keywords
    285 have been used more than 2 times in the literature on modelling the deterioration
    of water pipes. Whereas only 141 out of these 285 are co-occurring. Fig. 6 shows
    the VOSviewer network map of the co-occurrence of 141 connected keywords related
    to modelling water pipe deterioration. Each node in this network represents a
    single keyword. The bigger the node size, the more frequently the keyword occurs.
    The thickness of lines connecting each node indicates each keyword''s co-occurrence
    in the surveyed literature. The findings extracted from Fig. 6 can be summarised
    as follows: • The network map in Fig. 6 is numerically translated into a combination
    bar chart in Fig. 7. The keywords are arranged in an ascending order based on
    the occurrence weight (grey bars). Unsurprisingly, the keywords “water distribution
    network, water pipes, deterioration, and water supply” have the largest nodes,
    which means they are the most occurring keywords in the literature. These keywords
    also co-occur most frequently (link strength) with the keyword “corrosion”, which
    is one of the major causes of water pipe deterioration [56]. Nevertheless, using
    keyword-based judgements, the occurrences of corrosion mechanisms (e.g., pitting
    corrosion) and their causes (e.g., soil properties) are quite rare. This suggests
    that more investigations should consider these factors in modelling water pipe
    deterioration. Download : Download high-res image (455KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 7. Keywords co-occurrence results. • A close look at the
    link strength bars shows that deterioration studies are highly linked to condition
    assessment and infrastructure management studies [79]. Also, it appears that fuzzy
    inference and forecasting techniques have been used in modelling water pipe deterioration.
    However, intervention analysis in the time series models is not seen in the forecasting
    models, and such analysis is crucial for revealing the effect of predictor changes
    on the estimation models. Although rehabilitation strategy affects the deterioration
    process, based on its occurrence (n = 5), it can be observed that it has not received
    significant attention in previous studies. • A study by Zangenehmadar and Moselhi
    [136] indicates that the pipe material has the most profound impact on water pipe
    deterioration, but the number of related keywords occurrences is limited. For
    instance, cast iron has the highest occurrence frequency (40 times), while iron,
    asbestos cement, and prestressed concrete cylinder pipes co-occur in the literature
    19, 17, and 15 times, respectively. However, ductile iron and plastic are used,
    but both do not even exceed the designated threshold of three co-occurrence times
    to create a keyword map. This implies that more investigations are required to
    differentiate between various materials'' performance and deterioration. Download

    deterioration 5. Mixed systematic-binary response review Although the scientometric
    analysis gives interesting insights into modelling the water pipe deterioration,
    these insights are somehow superficial. Therefore, a systematic review is crucial
    for developing deeper insights into the study topic. Moreover, a systematic review
    must identify detailed and nuanced research gaps and provide insightful future
    directions. As shown in Fig. 3, the systematic review was performed in parallel
    with the scientometric analysis. The input for both systematic review and scientometric
    analysis is the output of the bibliometric survey. Unlike the scientometric analysis,
    the systematic review requires reading the shortlisted literature dutifully and
    critically. Another exclusion criterion was adopted in this context by excluding
    the least cited conference papers, conference reviews, and book chapters. Also,
    the articles on qualitative research methods and the studies that used physical
    and structural analysis (i.e., lab-based analysis, finite element, and stress-strain
    measurements) were excluded as they are beyond the scope of this review. Thus,
    the number of articles was reduced to 91. Fig. 8 summarises water pipe deterioration
    modelling approaches described in the selected literature sources. This figure
    reveals that the water pipe deterioration has been examined either through statistical
    models [68] or through data-driven and artificial intelligence techniques [28,29].
    These models and techniques use four different measures to estimate the time to
    break [87], remaining service life [135], failure rate [111], or probability of
    water pipes failure [7]. The applicability and accuracy of these models rely on
    the quality and availability of predictor data [90]. Predictors are the key inputs
    for modelling water pipes'' deterioration. Therefore, revising these predictors
    and assessing their suitability for the modelling techniques is pertinent and
    typically achieved through performing a binary response analysis. Download : Download

    describing water pipe deterioration models and their predictors. 5.1. Binary response
    analysis Binary response analysis is used when variables of a study have only
    two outcomes, either success or failure. This analysis follows the binomial variate
    of a single Bernoulli trial, where success is denoted by ‘1’ and failure is denoted
    by ‘0’ [2]. This analysis is used to identify the predictors in the deterioration
    models and classify them into suitable categories. Thereafter, a frequency analysis
    was used to arrange the predictors based on the number of their occurrences in
    the deterioration modelling studies. By applying these fundamentals to the 86
    articles selected, the predictors were tracked, extracted, and grouped in a Microsoft
    Excel spreadsheet. Each column in the spreadsheet represents one predictor, and
    each row stands for a research article. For each article, a predictor was assigned
    a value of ‘1’ when it was used in the research article and ‘0’ otherwise. The
    resulting data were analysed, and the outcomes are presented in the following
    section. 5.2. Results and discussion of the mixed systematic-binary response review
    Analysis of the results from the previous section indicates that the identified
    predictors could be categorised into four: pipe-related, soil and corrosion-induced,
    operational, and environmental predictors. Table 3 summarises the findings of
    the binary response statistics. The results of the binary response analysis combined
    with the systematic review of these four categories provide valuable insights
    into future research directions. Table 3. Binary response analysis of the predictors

    predictors. 5.2.1. Pipe-related predictors In this category, the pipe predictors
    are the factors that are considered, even if pipes do not carry any fluid. Following
    this assumption, several predictors are included, such as the pipe length, wall
    thickness, diameter, age, material, installation time, and manufacturing method.
    In addition, the pipe segment, number of segments, and number of connections (or
    joints) are added to the predictors. Response statistics show that the pipe diameter,
    age, and material are used in almost 84% of the reviewed studies, and the pipe
    diameter is the most considered predictor, with 62 responses. Furthermore, the
    pipe age and installation time are used in 80% of the pipe-related predictors.
    Although the pipe thickness reduction strongly impacts the pipe service life [112],
    the pipe wall thickness appears in only 15 of the 86 reviewed articles. Moreover,
    the usage of the pipe segmentation number, segment length, and the number of connections
    (joints) are very limited, as indicated in Malinowska [84] and Davis et al. [25].
    Nevertheless, the number of segments in water pipelines is utilised to estimate
    the deterioration rate in PVC water pipelines. A water pipe segment is defined
    as the total length of connected pipes with the same diameter and material. The
    length of each segment has also been used as a predictor. For instance, Giustolisi
    et al. [43] and Yannopoulos and Spiliotis [132] use it as a fuzzy factor to study
    the reliability of water pipes. Furthermore, the manufacturing method appears
    in less than 2% of the research articles. This predictor was utilised by Debón
    et al. [30], Herz [48], Kabir et al. [59], Kabir et al. [60,61], Lu et al. [81],
    and Walski and Pelliccia [123]. The binary response analysis of the pipe-related
    predictors matches the findings of Zangenehmadar and Moselhi [136], who claimed
    that age (vintage), diameter, length, and materials are the most important pipe-related
    predictors. Kettler and Goulter [66] also mentioned that deterioration occurs
    as the failure rate increases with time. Thus, pipe age is one of the major factors
    affecting water pipe deterioration [15,63]. The usage of pipe age in modelling
    water pipe deterioration is summarised in Table 4. Table 4. Usage of pipe age
    and installation time and their associated models. Reference Modelling mode Burn

    al. [117], and Yannopoulos and Spiliotis [132]. Artificial intelligence (Soft
    computing) model The pipe age predictor forms a major part of the data required
    for statistical modelling [68] and artificial intelligence modelling [28,29] techniques.
    In statistical models, this predictor was used in some deterministic models, such
    as the time-exponential [21,109,123], time linear [21,66,82,96], linear regression
    [20,37,61,89,115,125], logistic regression [91,92], and evolutionary regression
    [74] models. However, pipe age is barely applied to power models. Thus, further
    investigation is required to examine the influence of pipe age on the deterioration
    modelling process using the power model. Additionally, single and multivariate
    statistical models have been constituted and run based on historical age data.
    For instance, Herz [48] studied the ageing process of water pipes using a survival
    cohort model, while Kleiner [67] used water pipe age as a significant predictor
    to forecast the replacement time in a semi-Markov model. Besides, this predictor
    has been applied to estimate the probability of failure as a measure of deterioration
    through Bayesian inference modelling [61]. In addition, this predictor was utilised
    in Weibull and proportional hazard models [20,33,57]. With the advent of data-driven
    modelling and artificial intelligence, studying the effect of pipe age on modelling
    pipe deterioration offer deeper insights into this problem. This is particularly
    interesting when soft data representing experts'' opinions are merged with hard
    data derived from historical records [65]. Thus, pipe age data has been successfully
    exploited in many artificial neural networks for modelling pipes deterioration
    [4,5,37,38,54,65,115]. Nevertheless, most of these models describe individual
    water pipes or are adaptable for short-term prioritisation processes only, limiting
    their applicability to a pipes network. This can be attributed to the random replacement
    of water pipes due to the various causes of failure [114]. In addition, water
    pipe dimension and material, as pipe-related predictors, are correlated. They
    form part of the inputs for most deterioration models, especially pipe diameter
    and wall thickness. Several studies have been devoted to studying water pipe deterioration
    modelling based on pipe size. Rajeev et al. [98] stated that a large-sized pipe
    is defined as a pipe with a diameter exceeding 300 mm. Kettler and Goulter [66]
    and Pelletier et al. [93] reported that water pipes with a small diameter (<200
    mm) deteriorate faster than the large ones. In this regard, pipe dimensions can
    be differentiated by material or manufacturing method. For instance, the wall
    thickness of cast iron pipes is larger than that of ductile iron pipes [130].
    As a result, the pipe dimension and material have been used in modelling water
    pipe deterioration through statistical [21,96,123] and soft computing [69,87,117,125,135]
    techniques. Moreover, very few studies have investigated the effect of the manufacturing
    method on the water pipes'' deterioration. Jiang et al. [58] studied the correlation
    between the manufacturing method and its mitigation. The authors used the remaining
    service life as a deterioration measure for spun and static cast iron pipes. They
    concluded that spun cast iron pipes are more likely to break than statically produced
    ones. Although material and manufacturing methods influence the dimensions of
    water pipes [130], the correlation between these predictors has not been adequately
    assessed. Additionally, the effect of pipe manufacturing methods still requires
    more research attention in modelling water pipe deterioration. In connection with
    the keyword analysis results, cast iron water pipes have received the most interest.
    For example, Fu et al. [39] have developed a physical-based reliability model
    to assess the deterioration of lined cast iron pipes. Fu et al. [40] have adopted
    a semi-ellipsoid corrosion shape to physically model the stress concentration
    factors affecting large-cast iron pipes'' corrosion propagation. Also, Rathnayaka
    et al. [100] and Rathnayaka et al. [101] have investigated the leak-to-break and
    burst capacity of cast iron water pipes. 5.2.2. Soil and corrosion-induced predictors
    Although many scholars have investigated pipe-soil interaction, especially the
    interaction between soil and ferrous metals [22], soil and corrosion-induced predictors
    are the second most essential parameters after the pipe-related predictors in
    modelling water pipe deterioration. Table 3 shows that the sub-total frequency
    of soil and corrosion-induced predictors is almost 50% of the pipe-induced predictors.
    Soil type and soil corrosivity form about 50% of all investigated soil and corrosion-induced
    predictors. Moreover, the usage frequency of the bedding condition predictors
    in the literature indicates its significance. On the other hand, the pipe protection
    method, corrosion depth, inner corrosion, backfill material, and trench depth
    are the least investigated predictors. However, the availability of limited research
    on these predictors does not necessarily imply their insignificance. For instance,
    Najjaran et al. [89] stated that the backfill and other soil-based corrosion factors
    greatly affect the deterioration rate of cast and ductile iron water pipes. Also,
    some experts claim that the backfill material and trench depth strongly affect
    the deterioration process [136]. However, a quantitative study is required to
    check the influence of these predictors on the water pipe deterioration. In binary
    response analysis, soil type is the most frequent predictor among other soil and
    corrosion-induced predictors. This can be seen in the frequent utilisation of
    this indicator for estimating the deterioration in terms of time to break [66,109,123]
    and failure rates [85]. Besides, soil type has been combined with soil corrosivity
    to predict the probability of failure [7,31,32,55,60,61] and the remaining service
    life [27] of water pipes. These deterioration measures are updated by adding bedding
    conditions to the soil type and soil corrosivity to determine the same measures
    in cast iron [34,87,96] and ABS [81] pipes. The deterioration modelling based
    on these measures has been limited to statistical modelling techniques, which
    cannot undertake more predictors. Hence, data-driven and artificial intelligence
    have been adopted to allow using more predictors. For instance, Al-Barqawi and
    Zayed [4] used trench depth along with other predictors in a simple neural network
    model to rate the condition of water pipes by predicting their failure rates.
    However, this model is not clearly explained since the neural network is a black
    box. Another advancement in using various predictors for deterioration modelling
    is the case of Tesfamariam et al. [117], where they added backfill and inner corrosion
    data to a multi-layer neural network to measure the remaining pipe service life.
    Most soil and corrosion-induced predictors have been used to predict failure rates
    as a measure of water pipe deterioration [89,137]. However, the change in water
    pipe strength due to the soil and corrosion effects might be another factor that
    increases the water pipe deterioration rate [108]. Protection methods for mitigating
    pipeline deterioration are of two folds: internal protection, such as lining [35],
    which is used to mitigate inner corrosion, or external protection utilised to
    minimise corrosion caused by soil corrosivity, such as the use of PE tapes [14].
    Generally, most of the data used in the protection method are qualitative in nature,
    and transferring the protection method to a quantitative predictor may give more
    accurate deterioration models. 5.2.3. Operations-induced predictors The operations
    of WDNs play a significant role in water pipe deterioration. In this category,
    operation-induced predictors are factors that keep the water-carrying process
    in the pipes, thus delivering to customers at satisfying speed and pressure and
    good quality. Therefore, only four main elements are considered in this category,
    including the water pressure head, consumption rate, water properties, and study
    location. The binary response statistics in Table 3 show that the operations-induced
    predictors have not received much attention from scholars, where the subtotal
    of the operations-induced predictors is 56. Although pressure head significantly
    impacts water pipes'' deterioration [127,129], it is yet to be considered in a
    holistic model that includes other operations-induced predictors. For instance,
    Rathnayaka et al. [99] investigated the effect of pressure fluctuation on the
    ageing process in three Australian cities. Therefore, more data are required to
    elucidate the pressure head''s effect on the water pipe''s deterioration. Currently,
    the study location has not been considered a predictor in the literature. Nevertheless,
    the location differs in each study, which may affect the environmental, social,
    and economic impacts of water pipe deterioration. Moreover, representing predictors
    like water consumption rate and water properties in the deterioration models is
    minimal (around 6% of the studies have used water properties and water consumption
    rates as predictors). In the literature, frequent change in the pressure head
    leads to transient flow that can cause inner corrosion [57]. This change in pressure
    may occur due to several reasons, such as water pipe failure (leak/break) [134].
    Consequently, the pressure head is an important predictor for developing models
    of water pipe deterioration. Pressure head has been used to develop several models
    for different materials, such as cast iron [87,96,117], polyethene [24], ABS [81],
    and asbestos cement [26]. The deterioration of these materials has been studied
    at several locations for different cases. In Connecticut, Jeffrey [55] stated
    that the water flows in iron pipes with pressure ranging between 3.0 and 17.0
    psi. Davis and Marlow [27] developed a deterioration model to create an asset
    management framework for large-sized cast iron pipes in an Australian water distribution
    municipality. Cooper et al. [23] considered the peak pressure at 8 AM in Thames
    Water London to study the deterioration risk of water pipes with different materials.
    These studies indicate the importance of the study location on pipe deterioration
    modelling. Based on the aforementioned statements, Table 5 summarises studies
    applied in different cities and their deterioration modelling techniques. In this
    table, more than 15 modelling techniques have been used to determine the water
    pipe deterioration mechanism. For instance, the neural networks were used to create
    the deterioration models in 7 locations, including Ontario [5,11,47], City of
    Moncton [5,38], Poland [71], Mahabad [111], and Cyprus, Montreal, and Taiwan [20,49,135].
    On the other hand, the proportional hazard model was employed in 6 other locations,
    including Lausanne [76], several cities in Australia ([1,27]; Azam [31,32,78]),
    Calgary [60,117], Chicoutimi [83], Ferrara [7], and Cyprus [20]. The rest of these
    locations were studied with various models, as shown in Fig. 6. It is noteworthy
    that most of these models include pipe-related and soil-induced predictors. However,
    applying deterioration models in a certain location does not necessarily imply
    their potential for other locations. This is because many of these models ignore
    special environmental and climatic changes, except in some limited studies discussed
    in section 5.2.4. Table 5. Summary of studied locations and the applied models

    predictors As discussed in section 5.2.3, the study location significantly affects
    the deterioration models due to the environment of the water pipes. Hence, reviewing
    the impact of the environment on the deterioration of water pipes is of great
    interest. Besides the water pipe location, the environmental predictors are the
    uncontrolled factors surrounding the water pipes, except for soil. Table 3 summarises
    the frequency of applying environmentally induced predictors in the literature.
    It is clear from Table 3 that researchers have not given much attention to environmental
    factors. For instance, the utilisation of daily traffic as an environment–induced
    predictor does not exceed 10% of the 86 studies. Furthermore, the location of
    a study contributes to the frequency of using environmental and climatic factors.
    For example, frost load has been used in different locations in Canada, including
    Manitoba and Calgary [45,60,61,66,117]. This is because the temperature in these
    locations drops to less than 0 °C, and snow covers the roads. On the other hand,
    humidity has been employed as a significant predictor in coastal cities, such
    as Lausanne [76] and Ferrara [7]. Although frost load, freezing index, and temperature
    have been used as predictors for many decades [123], the effect of climatic change
    and environmental aspects first appears in a 2012 study by Rajani et al. [95]
    to investigate the effect of temperature covariates on water pipe deterioration.
    Laucelli et al. [74] later adopted an evolutionary paradigm to study the effect
    of climate change and concluded that deterioration modelling measures are more
    accurate in cold seasons than in warm ones. However, it is necessary to differentiate
    between the effect of climate factors on water pipe deterioration and the burst/break
    because the burst itself has several forms, some of which define the water pipe
    end of service [68]. This means that further investigation into the effect of
    climate change and environmental aspects is required to examine the water pipes''
    deterioration mechanisms. 6. Sensors and monitoring technologies As discussed
    above, the water pipe deterioration mechanism is affected by pipe, soil, operational,
    and environmental factors, which makes it hard to identify the water pipe failure
    behaviour. The integration of these factors leads to expediting pipe deterioration.
    Hence, to control this, continuous WDN monitoring is required. As shown in Fig.
    1, health monitoring technologies, including sensors, actuators, and communication
    tools, provide essential data for the water pipe deterioration modelling. In this
    regard, many studies have been conducted on water pipe networks'' health monitoring.
    Moreover, several monitoring technologies have been adopted, such as acoustic
    methods, eddy currents, ultrasonic waves, and electromagnetic waves, to detect,
    localise, and pinpoint faults/leaks in water pipes. Besides, hundreds of studies
    have been performed to investigate and apply a wide range of monitoring techniques.
    By checking the existing studies on Scopus and Google Scholar databases, 16 papers
    have reviewed the literature on health monitoring and sensing technologies. Table
    6 summarises these reviews'' objectives, number of studies, and timespan. The
    most relevant work to these review articles is the work done by Latif et al. [73].
    The authors discussed the impact of the factors affecting the deterioration on
    the selection of health monitoring and sensing technologies. Other studies have
    reviewed sensing, communications, and health monitoring technologies in different
    forms. For instance, Yu et al. [133] and Hu et al. [51] reviewed the applications
    of acoustic and ultrasonic sensing for monitoring water and sewer pipes. Bakhtawar
    and Zayed [13] focused on studies that used hydrophone technologies to detect
    and pinpoint water pipe leaks. Tran et al. [118] considered the literature on
    the sensing technologies used to detect PVC pipes'' faults. These studies can
    be described as an extension of the studies done by Liu and Kleiner [80], Liu
    and Kleiner [79], and Rizzo [102], who reviewed the research on health monitoring
    applications for water pipes between 1989 and 2013. Additionally, several advancements
    in sensing and health techniques, such as robots [3,86] and real-time measurement
    and communication systems [72,116]. Table 6. Review literature on health monitoring

    up, the data collected from sensors is a key input to water pipe deterioration
    and failure prediction models. The performance of the pipe failure models relies
    on the accuracy of different sensing elements. In this regard, further investigations
    and advancement are still required to reduce the discrepancies caused by sensors.
    7. Summary and fault tree logic A fault tree diagram is a graphical representation
    of the fault tree analysis. The diagram captures the rationale behind the factors
    and causes of a certain failure or incident. The fault tree diagram uses the Boolean
    logic gates (AND and OR) to identify the logical combination of different factors
    and causes that result in an incident occurrence [8]. In this regard, the fault
    tree diagram summarises the relationship between various predictors leading to
    water pipe deterioration. Fig. 9 shows the fault tree diagram of the water pipe
    deterioration. Pipe deterioration is a consequence of several events, causes,
    and predictors. Deterioration is caused by the sum of three key causal mechanisms:
    internal corrosion [112], mechanical loads [20], and external corrosion [22].
    Each deterioration-causing mechanism is affected by at least one of the reviewed
    predictors'' categories. The pipe-related predictors are basic events that directly
    affect external corrosion, internal corrosion, and mechanical loads [37,111].
    More details on internal corrosion as a consequence of pipe-related and operational
    predictors can be found in the study of Zangenehmadar and Moselhi [136], while
    the propagation of internal corrosion with respect to the lining method and its
    efficiency can be found in the study of Wang et al. [124]. In other words, in
    the case of lining failure, the waterpipe might not be able to provide sufficient
    structural support. Currently, Australian municipalities adopt structural cured-in-place
    pipe (CIPP) to rehabilitate water pipelines. Shannon et al. [110] assessed the
    performance of CIPP and sprayed lining to reduce the probability of failure in
    water pipes. Even though Gunatilake et al. [46] addressed this issue by combining
    stereo vision with a laser profile to detect the internal lining flaws in water
    pipes, further investigations are required to cover the effect of interior lining
    flows. Besides the pipe predictors, the mechanical loading may result from either
    environmental [7], soil [55], or operational [60,92] predictors. External corrosion
    occurs due to environmental and soil predictors. However, the basic events1 of
    the environmental and soil predictors that lead to the mechanical load deterioration
    mechanisms differ from the basic events of the soil and environmental predictors
    that impact the external corrosion. On the other hand, the external corrosion
    of water pipes is a consequence of the interaction between the pipe and soil [22].
    Hence, soil corrosivity, humidity, temperature, and backfilling properties affect
    the propagation of external corrosion [130]. In order to decrease the propagation
    of external corrosion, water municipalities use several protection methods, such
    as cathodic protection [41] and coating [18]. Nevertheless, mechanical loads are
    affected by the covering soil properties and the construction method [136]. Generally,
    adopting a suitable construction method and adequately selecting the bedding and
    backfilling material reduce the mechanical loads induced by the traffic loads
    [62]. Download : Download high-res image (271KB) Download : Download full-size

    Research gaps and future directions Although modelling water pipes deterioration
    has been extensively studied, there are still some critical research gaps and
    challenges. Accordingly, this study proposes future research directions and recommendations
    based. Fig. 10 shows the matrix summarising the extracted research gaps based
    on the predictors'' classification. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download

    directions. 8.1. Extracted research gaps • This study identifies gaps in pipe-related
    predictors based on the above mixed systematic-binary response review. Generally,
    out of the ten predictors, four predictors have not been adequately considered
    in the literature, and their effect on the water pipe deterioration modelling
    requires further investigation. These predictors are the number of joints [84],
    segments [25,84], length of segments [74,132], and manufacturing method [30,48,60,61,81,123].
    These four predictors need further investigation to measure their effect on the
    deterioration modelling of WDNs. • Although experts claim that soil properties
    are crucial for modelling the deterioration of water pipelines [136], these predictors
    are not entirely well-studied. For instance, corrosion rate and its indentation
    are used only in physical models [89] despite being the direct causes of water
    pipes deterioration [37,91]. Therefore, the output of the physical models gives
    reasonable indications of the WDNs'' deterioration. These data can be used to
    improve the deterioration models. In addition, the protection method is used to
    assess the condition of the WDNs [78] and to predict pipe failure [5,47] or failure
    risk [38]. However, few articles have considered the protection method in deterioration
    modelling. As shown in Fig. 8, the protection method is used to reduce internal
    and external corrosions, which are direct deterioration causes. Therefore, they
    should be considered in the modelling process. • The gaps in the operational-induced
    predictors are threefold. First, water properties cause different drawbacks in
    water pipes, such as leaching corrosion and biofilm creation [103], yet they have
    not received significant consideration in any data-driven-based deterioration
    models. Second, water flow rate or water velocity and consumption rate have not
    been applied as predictors in the literature though some experts opine that they
    are essential predictors [136]. The data of water flow rate and customer consumption
    rate can be measured by smart meters, yet they are not readily available or adequately
    used. • The environment-induced predictors need further investigation, especially
    those related to climate and location. Even though these predictors have been
    considered in many studies, their applicability is limited to investigating short-term
    failure [43]. Likewise, groundwater level affects the performance of WDNs [5],
    but it is not employed for the statistical and AI-based deterioration models.
    In addition, the impact of other buried utilities, which share the same tunnel
    with the water pipelines, has not been well tackled in the water pipe deterioration
    modelling. 8.2. Recommended future directions In order to fill the research gaps
    in section 7.1, the following research directions are recommended: • The water
    pipe deterioration counteracts the performance of WDNs, and, consequently, their
    sustainability. The sustainability of the WDNs means sustaining their structural
    integrity and hydraulic capacity while minimising energy consumption [88]. In
    this regard, developing optimisation models to minimise pipes'' deterioration
    rates helps in improving WDNs sustainability. • Many researchers tackled the economic
    effect of water pipe deterioration [27], but not many investigated the effect
    of economic growth on the advances of WDNs and the reduction of their deterioration.
    • Modelling the relationship between resource consumption and wastewater is crucial
    to tackling water resources'' sustainability, which can be measured by continuously
    monitoring water consumption. • Further investigations are necessary to understand
    the effect of climate change and greenhouse emissions on soil properties, which
    directly affect water pipe failure. • Population density and growth are two main
    factors associated with social sustainable development. While population density
    and growth impact infrastructural development [44], they are yet to be employed
    in modelling water pipe deterioration. • Data accuracy and availability are challenging
    issues in WDNs deterioration modelling [113]. Finding new techniques (smart sensors)
    for data management and collection may be another exciting research stream. In
    this stream, the internet of things and real-data monitoring techniques are recommended
    to collect continuous and accurate data. • Although GIS has been used in some
    individual cases, accurate locations of the replaced or rehabilitated pipes are
    still hard to record. In this aspect, cloud computing is a good future direction
    that may give better results when integrated with GIS. • Although many versions
    of neural networks and other big data analytics techniques deal with data impurity
    and data availability problems, these techniques are expected to include the sustainability-related
    aspect to represent or capture the impact of climate change. • Usually, deterioration
    modelling and performance measurement techniques are preliminary stages to the
    rehabilitation, maintenance, and replacement decisions. However, these three decisions
    can affect the WDN structure. Therefore, intervention analysis in time series
    to study the effect of rehabilitation, maintenance, and replacement on water pipe
    deterioration is expected to give more flexibility to the deterioration models.
    • Climate change and the greenhouse effect are exogenous factors in long-term
    planning, and thus, the effect of long-term climate change is necessary to develop
    a robust deterioration model. 9. Conclusions This article provides a thorough
    literature review of existing predictors in modelling WDN deterioration. Consequently,
    it extracts the research gaps and recommends insightful research streams to help
    draw future agendas for researchers. Within the study context, three levels of
    review methodology were used to achieve the objective of this research. First,
    a bibliometric survey was performed to collect, clean, and sort the most relevant
    research articles in modelling water pipe deterioration. Second, science mapping
    was implemented through scientometric analysis using the VOSviewer mapping software.
    The results of the scientometric analysis in terms of keywords co-occurrence show
    that corrosion is the most frequently used term in the WDN deterioration modelling.
    Besides, condition assessment is the most related keyword to deterioration modelling.
    Third, a novel mixed systematic-binary response review technique was used to study
    the frequency of these predictors in the deterioration modelling development.
    This technique helped in dividing the predictors considered in the existing deterioration
    models into four categories. These categories included pipe-related, soil, operational,
    and environmental-induced predictors. The results of this mixed technique show
    that the pipe-related predictors (pipe diameter, length, and material) are the
    most used, while the operational and environmental-induced predictors require
    further future studies. Based on these results, some research gaps in terms of
    missing predictors and modelling gaps were extracted, and future directions were
    recommended. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have

    Versions Notes Abstract Ecological agriculture projects have achieved a growing
    development in the context of low carbon. However, because of the great difference
    in these issues from traditional types, there exist risks in progression quality
    and sustainability. To better identify the risk, this paper proposes a novel hybrid
    approach that integrates the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) with technique for
    order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS), as well as an improved
    support vector machine (SVM) based on the brainstorming algorithm (BSO). First,
    a risk evaluation index framework is developed and elaborated in terms of the
    natural environment, society, market economy, management, technology, and finance.
    Then the traditional assessment can be derived from AHP with TOPSIS. In addition,
    BSO is applied to improve SVM for rapid computation. Finally, a case study is
    implemented to verify the accuracy of the proposed technique. In this research,
    based on the low-carbon perspective, artificial intelligence algorithm and risk
    assessment are introduced into the field of ecological agriculture project management,
    which is conducive to the rapid and effective evaluation of ecological agriculture
    project risk. It can improve managers’ risk awareness and risk management ability,
    reduce investment blindness, and help ecological agriculture projects achieve
    healthy and sustainable development under the background of low carbon, thus contributing
    to the development of a low-carbon economy. Keywords: AHP; BSO; ecological agriculture
    project; low carbon; risk evaluation; SVM; TOPSIS 1. Introduction In contrast
    to traditional agricultural modes, the ecological agriculture project is a novel
    development pattern integrating eco-tourism, product processing, leisure and entertainment,
    elderly care, and business service [1], which can achieve organic unity of economic,
    social, and ecological benefits [2]. In other words, an ecological agriculture
    project is a kind of “sustainable agriculture” project. It is an agricultural
    production system that reduces the use of chemical agricultural products as much
    as possible and mainly relies on crops and artificial technology to improve the
    quality of agricultural products, improve the agricultural ecological environment,
    and improve production efficiency and benefit. Nowadays, with the burgeoning development
    of a low-carbon economy, strong support for modern agriculture mode concerning
    systems and policies has been given in China that attracts many investors to set
    foot in this field and contributes to rapid growth [3]. However, it cannot get
    rid of inherent characteristics of agriculture, such as a long construction cycle,
    large capital investment, and slow investment return. Simultaneously, the low-carbon
    economy has also brought new content to the risks [4]. As a result, it is of great
    necessity to carry out systematic risk evaluation research on ecological agriculture
    projects. As for assessment content, some scholars have begun to study risk estimation
    of ecological or traditional agriculture projects [5,6,7,8,9]. Reference [5] came
    up with a risk assessment method regarding ecological land in the black soil region
    of Northeast China. The geo-weighted regression model detected potential factors
    and took the natural environment and urbanization process together with food production
    conditions into account. The technical system of agricultural multi-disaster meteorological
    disaster risk evaluation was discussed in reference [6]. Based on the regional
    historical disaster data from 1978 to 2020 in the first national comprehensive
    natural disaster risk survey, risk estimation was implemented in 18 major grain-producing
    areas of Jilin Province. The literature [7] developed a hybrid risk evaluation
    model that could capture the interdependence among water, energy, and food shortage
    risk. In addition, a chance-constrained programming approach was established in
    the paper based on Copula. This measure has been applied to the agricultural WEF
    linkage system in northern China, where the shortage of water, energy, or land
    affects the agricultural output. Reference [8] pointed out that the ex-ante research
    on index-based insurance as a financial risk management tool for agricultural
    danger has increased prominently. At the same time, some new study trends were
    highlighted to guide future research, particularly the use of remote sensing data
    and hydrological as well as crop models to address data scarcity, geo-based dangers,
    and climate change issues. A comprehensive study was conducted in reference [9]
    directed towards environmental risk assessment comprising frequent monitoring
    of water and soil parameters (24 in total). The risk categories of three agricultural
    projects were determined following quality and quantity. To sum up, it can be
    found that the importance of risk assessment on agriculture projects is increasingly
    apparent, but few studies focus on ecological agriculture issues, especially lacking
    quantitative risk estimation from the perspective of low carbon. By combing through
    existing studies, it can also be found that some scholars have started to study
    the risk assessment of ecological agriculture projects or traditional agricultural
    projects, and the evaluation contents mainly include: In terms of land ecological
    risk, agricultural financial risk, geographical basis, climate change risk, environmental
    risk, etc. Although the above studies have involved the risk assessment of ecological
    agriculture projects or traditional agricultural projects, the evaluation content
    is relatively simple. Therefore, this research evaluates the risk of ecological
    agriculture projects from six aspects: nature, society, market economy, management,
    technology, and finance. It is expected to cover the whole life cycle of the project
    from pre-planning fundraising to completion and later operation so as to make
    a complete evaluation of the risk of the ecological agriculture project. Concerning
    assessment approaches, there are chiefly two categories: traditional evaluation
    models and intelligent techniques [10]. AHP, Delphi approach, and matter-element
    extension means, along with ideal solution, belong to classical estimation measures
    [11], while artificial neural network (ANN) together with support vector machine
    (SVM) pertains to modern intelligent methods [12]. Despite extensive application
    and exact results, traditional methods have difficulty in dealing with a large
    amount of data. However, intelligent algorithms embody the merits of rapid and
    accurate data processing. This study attempts to integrate these two categories
    of means for risk evaluation research aiming at ecological agriculture projects.
    The conventional TOPSIS method calculates the proximity between the assessment
    target and the ideal solution by approximating the positive and negative ideal
    solutions. It is supposed that the estimation target is optimal, which is the
    closest to the positive ideal solution and farthest from the negative ideal solution
    [13]. However, the reverse order problem in TOPSIS cannot be ignorable in towards
    evaluation of multiple indicators and objects. Concretely, the ranking consequence
    of estimation targets, even the future decision precision, may change owing to
    the alteration of positive and negative ideal solutions as well as the weights.
    To settle this issue, a modified TOPSIS is introduced in the paper. Considering
    the merits of flexibility and conciseness, AHP is selected here for weight determination
    in combination with qualitative as well as quantitative decision-making [14].
    Afterward, more and more researchers concentrated on SVM, which is grounded in
    statistical theory [15]. In line with VC dimension theory and structural risk
    minimization, SVM makes efforts to find a perfect balance between learning capabilities
    and model complicacy [16]. This technique looks for a hyperplane in high-dimensional
    feature space to which the training set is nonlinearly mapped. The space can meet
    the maximization of the isolation edge between positive and negative examples
    [17]. Given the disadvantages of ANN such as over-fitting, easily trapping into
    local optimization, and result selection, SVM can validly solve the above problems.
    Additionally, it is proper for coping with nonlinear, high-dimensional data, which
    is extensively applied in pattern recognition along with data mining, etc. [18].
    Nevertheless, appropriate parameter selection has a momentous impact on computing
    performance [19]. Thereby, it is necessary to employ appropriate intelligent methods
    to optimize the parameters. Brain Storm Optimization (BSO) applies clustering
    ideas to local optimum and acquires global one via contrast. Moreover, this means
    adopting mutation ideas to expand diversity and prevent trapping into local optimum.
    It is demonstrated that BSO is suited for multi-modal and high-dimensional issues
    [20]. Therefore, this study proposes a hybrid model combining BSO with SVM for
    risk assessment of ecological agriculture projects. In summary, this paper establishes
    a system directed at quantitative risk estimation in ecological agriculture projects
    from the aspect of low carbon. The rest of the study is arranged as follows: Section
    2 separates the indicators into six groups, namely natural environment, society,
    market economy, management, technology, and finance, and explains the evaluation
    indexes and makes a detailed explanation. Section 3 develops a classical evaluation
    model AHP-TOPSIS and intelligent assessment technique SVM integrated with BSO,
    respectively. An example is employed here to validate the precision and validity
    of the established method. Section 5 summarizes the research results. 2. Indicator
    System 2.1. Structure of Index System Due to their large scale and time-consuming,
    risk identification of ecological agriculture projects costs more human, financial,
    and material resources and even has a significant impact on the balance between
    management benefits and revenue along with expenditure [21,22,23]. Considering
    the perspective differences between low carbon and traditional condition, this
    study collects and analyzes all kinds of references on project construction risk
    [24,25,26,27]. Here, the dangers are separated into six fields from the aspect
    of low carbon: natural environment, society, market economy, management, technology,
    and finance, which covers the whole life cycle of the projects from early planning
    and fundraising to completion and later operation. The specific risk indexes that
    are probable to result in enterprise losses are screened for prevention and response
    in advance, see Table 1. Table 1. Risk evaluation index system of ecological agriculture
    project risk from the aspect of low carbon. 2.2. Interpretation of Evaluation
    Indicators 2.2.1. Natural Environment Risk From the perspective of low carbon,
    natural environmental risk is the basic risk for ecological agriculture, and ecological
    agriculture has harsher requirements on the natural environment than traditional
    agriculture. The risks of water shortage, climate deterioration, environmental
    pollution, and soil fertility degradation caused by the natural environmental
    change have a serious impact on ecological agriculture projects. The change in
    natural environment is not only affected by the local climate and other natural
    conditions but also the traditional intensive agricultural technology used by
    human beings may lead to the degradation of soil fertility resources and other
    risks. Natural environmental risks mainly include natural disaster risk, natural
    condition risk, environmental pollution, and ecological degradation risk. (1)
    Natural disaster risk The severe dependence of agriculture on the environment
    determines farming industry directly faces the peril of natural disasters. Furthermore,
    other systemic risks are frequently induced, such as meteorological damage (drought,
    flood, hail, frost, typhoon, lightning, etc.), geological fatality (earthquake,
    volcano, landslide, etc.), and insect pests. Natural disasters in large regions
    generally influence product supply and cause price fluctuations. (2) Natural condition
    risk As a kind of pure danger, it refers to an objectively existing and irresistible
    environmental situation. All construction activities cannot violate natural laws.
    Hence, the development of ecological agriculture projects relies deeply on the
    environment. Natural condition risk consists of meteorological conditions as well
    as geological conditions. (3) Environmental pollution and ecological degradation
    risk Environmental problems such as water pollution, soil pollution, air pollution,
    and soil fertility resource degradation pose a major risk to the development of
    ecological agriculture. They not only seriously affect the quality of agricultural
    products but also pose a serious threat to people’s diet health and even threaten
    life safety. The impact of environmental pollution and ecological degradation
    on ecological agriculture projects is fatal. Once polluted, the value of the products
    will decrease greatly and even be destroyed in serious cases. Environmental pollution
    is two-sided, not only from the external environment; internal technology or improper
    operation may also cause environmental pollution and ecological degradation. 2.2.2.
    Social Risk Social risk means the chance caused by social conditions and political
    circumstances to ecological agriculture projects, which incorporates a change
    in national and local policy as well as public intervention. (1) Risk of national
    policy change The adjustment of national policy on ecological agriculture projects,
    especially the reduction of support, may lead to profit degradation, an extension
    of the payback period, and a decline in revenue. Additionally, variation in carbon
    tax policy probably increases risk because of low carbon. (2) Risk of local policy
    change Policy fluctuation involves local land use planning, regional program,
    business environment, and tax incentives. Weak support for ecological agriculture
    projects may result in forced reconstruction since land use does not conform to
    municipal planning. The item will suffer from financing difficulties and other
    economic losses. (3) Public intervention risk Implementation of farmers’ function
    replacement belongs to public intervention, including relocation of local villagers
    along with rural land circulation. If some villagers do not cooperate or even
    obstruct, projects will need long preparation time and high costs or fall into
    abort. 2.2.3. Market Economy Risk The risk emerges due to economic environment
    change and relation variation. It can be divided into the risk of change in consumer
    demand, intensified market competition, material supply fluctuation, and rising
    labor wages. (1) Risk of change in consumer demand There are many reasons for
    the hazard incorporating alteration of economic development, income level as well
    as consumption habits. Moreover, public health emergencies also convert consumer
    behavior. (2) Risk of change in intensified market competition Competition intensification
    gives rise to price slide. Too many competitors induce market saturation and sale
    drop. Ecological agriculture adopts organic, green, and pollution-free production
    techniques with high costs. Its price is much more expensive than ordinary farm
    goods, but its output only accounts for a little part of the market. Thereby,
    ecological agriculture is faced with serious market danger. (3) Risk of material
    supply fluctuation Price, quality, and quantity of raw materials commonly follow
    the market trend. The supplier’s credit risk also influences staff provision.
    Ecological agriculture production put forward strong demand for seeds, organic
    fertilizers, biological pesticides, etc. In light of its high price, unstable
    product quality, and output, together with huge rate fluctuation, there exists
    enormous risk in the procurement process, which is similar to agricultural equipment
    with low applicability. (4) Risk of rising labor wage The need for labor in ecological
    agriculture is immense. However, the contradiction between supply and demand of
    manpower is prominent owing to little quantity, aging structure, and low diathesis.
    Additionally, in virtue of the strong seasonal nature, there is a time conflict
    with local farmers’ production activities. Employment of foreign labor may also
    discord with native economic and cultural interests. The superposition of various
    factors has led to a sharp rise in earnings. 2.2.4. Management Risk During project
    operation, the administration may not meet expected requirements in the aspect
    of planning, organization, coordination, and control, which will cause management
    risk. Quality and safety losses occur as a result of a long cycle and complex
    factors. Moreover, direct or indirect economic wastage will be brought to the
    project. Management risks involve danger in personnel quality, production outsourcing,
    system process, contract, land transfer, and product quality. (1) Personnel quality
    risk This type of risk is the most common one in organization management. In the
    agricultural industry, both low-carbon administration and technical personnel
    are extremely scarce. Ecological agriculture pertains to the high-tech and high-risk
    industry with strict demand for talent and difficult working conditions. Accordingly,
    it is very hard to recruit qualified employees from the market. The quality risk
    of management personnel is presented in two aspects: on the one hand, operation
    errors are shown based on weak awareness of quality, safety, and law along with
    the sense of responsibility of management personnel; on the other hand, lack of
    effective administration system and domination process make the work out of control.
    Additionally, the bad moral quality of employees will also increase the risk.
    In particular, there are a large number of cash transactions in agricultural operations
    and irregular bills, which provides the staff with bad conduct a chance to take
    advantage of. (2) Production outsourcing risk This danger not only relates to
    the core issues such as product quality but also has a significant impact on production
    costs. As a high-tech industry, production outsourcing is generally used in ecological
    agriculture; that is, tasks are outsourced to professional manufacturing cooperatives,
    associated companies, or local farmers’ spontaneous organizations. Nevertheless,
    products fail to meet the requirements because of poor contractor ability. Some
    of them cannot operate advanced machines skillfully and carry out standards and
    specifications strictly. In addition, limited by farming hours and a shortage
    of labor resources, the cost soars to an astonishing level. (3) System process
    risk As a crucial part, a positive system procedure is an important support for
    efficient operation in the company. A reasonable process can standardize employees’
    behaviors, clarify responsibilities and stimulate enthusiasm. In this way, the
    staff can form good habits and improve efficiency simultaneously. If there exists
    a problem in the process, it will result in working delay, mutual responsibility
    shifting, administration confusion, and frequent operational errors. Thus, project
    quality cannot be guaranteed. (4) Contract risk Several people in agricultural
    production do not attach much importance to legal documents. The lack of contract
    spirit may bring about unnecessary losses. The ecological agriculture project
    is industrialized and market-oriented concerning material procurement, production
    outsourcing, and product sales. Therefore, contracts must be strictly reviewed
    and managed to protect legal rights and interests from infringement. (5) Land
    transfer risk Most of the land in ecological agriculture projects is transferred
    from farmers. Many grass-roots departments exploit this situation to compete with
    them for benefits and cause disputes, which involve the interests of the government,
    two rural committees, and villagers. Furthermore, low transparency and fairness
    of collective land transfer also arouse strong reactions from farmers. Although
    national laws and regulations have made many provisions in this regard, the contents
    are not perfect and need dynamic changes. In follow-up management, it is also
    easy to make conflicts with farmers due to poor communication. (6) Product quality
    risk This kind of risk runs through the whole process of the project. The product
    quality should be measured from two aspects: rich in nutrients and low in harmful
    substances. Control of quality safety relates to many links, such as the purchase
    of agricultural materials, production operation, environmental protection, and
    monitoring of storage and transportation process, which increases the difficulty
    in management. As the guarantee of project benefit, quality issues directly affect
    both people’s health and the ecological environment. 2.2.5. Technical Risk It
    refers to the risk that ecological agriculture projects adopt advanced biotechnology
    and production skills whose technical progressiveness, stability, adaptability,
    and safety are greatly different from the predicted state, resulting in production
    efficiency not meeting expectations, together with increased cost, substandard
    quality, and even possible biotechnology variation. Considering complex problems
    and changeable environment, risks exist in technology introduction, production
    operation, and administration, including information asymmetry, transformation
    stability, and technical disclosure. (1) Information asymmetry risk Sometimes,
    the recommended techniques and technology do not match the actual demand. It is
    common that the staff lack sufficient awareness of the novel skill or the R&D
    unit deliberately conceals technical defects, that is, information asymmetry.
    For example, the technology is unadvanced in effect, which leads to being quickly
    imitated and surpassed, or the outcome is too exaggerated to realize. (2) Transformation
    stability risk The environment of R&D is quite different from practical application.
    The relevant technology is normal in the experimental stage, but the prospective
    effect is hard to achieve or out of control, in reality, owing to great alternation
    in the natural environment. Most production sites for eco-agriculture are in the
    field except for the greenhouse; the variable surroundings increase the difficulty
    of extension. (3) Technology disclosure risk It can be seen that keeping a secret
    is difficult because of the open state. To ensure eco-technology at the leading
    level, first, it is necessary to do a good job in intellectual property protection
    to prevent leakage and loss of progressiveness. Second, strict technical operation
    procedures and management specifications should be formulated. 2.2.6. Financial
    Risk Ecological agriculture projects generally need long cycles and large initial
    investments. Slow fund returns and many cash transactions expand financing risk.
    It principally incorporates investment budget risk, financing risk, capital liquidity
    risk, and cost control risk. (1) Investment budget risk An investment budget means
    a capital expenditure plan plays a guiding role in all activities in the enterprise.
    It is necessary to take the life cycle of the project into account to predict
    the comprehensive income. Even if a reasonable budget is made, it will be influenced
    by various factors, such as changes in the price level, adjustments of bank interest
    rates, financing costs as well an uncertain construction period. Thus, the investment
    payback period of the project becomes erratic, allowing for the actual expenditure
    to deviate from the budget. Accordingly, elaborate precautions should be enforced
    based on full fund evaluation and practical situations. (2) Financing risk It
    implies the impact of uncertain factors on finance such as macroeconomic environment,
    capital supply and demand market, capital source structure, financing quantity,
    term and method, financial leverage, exchange and interest rate and currency value
    change, etc. The fluctuation of the financial market and unreasonable use of its
    capital structure and financial leverage will aggravate the danger. (3) Capital
    liquidity risk Cash shortage affects the daily operation of the project and debt
    repayment in the enterprise. For instance, improper debt proportion, reduced investment,
    and excessive purchase and production costs lead to above-norm payment, while
    exorbitant inventory conduces to irrational capital occupation. Abundant credit
    sales are probable to give rise to increased recovery costs, delayed payback periods,
    poor liquidity, and bad debts. (4) Cost control risk It is critical to implement
    strict cost control in consideration of huge investments and long construction
    periods in ecological agriculture projects. If there is a large discrepancy in
    the budget, construction delays and financing hardships may occur. Therefore,
    all expenditures must be grimly dominated in the whole process, especially aiming
    at costs of labor, machinery, raw material, etc. In this way, the project can
    refrain from losses. 3. Methods This study proposes a hybrid model combining BSO
    with SVM for risk assessment of ecological agriculture projects to realize fast
    and effective risk evaluation of ecological agriculture projects as well as promote
    healthy and sustainable development. 3.1. Application of AHP-MTOPSIS 3.1.1. AHP
    In combination with qualitative and quantitative decision-making, AHP is particularly
    suitable for dealing with big problems of multi-objective and multi-level complex
    systematization and complex problems of system engineering that are difficult
    to complete quantitative analysis and decision-making. Moreover, the indexes selected
    for the research topic in this paper are also difficult to be processed quantitatively.
    Therefore, AHP is chosen here to determine the weight of each index of the risk
    assessment index system of ecological agriculture projects. The specific calculation
    is illustrated as follows [28,29,30]: (1) Construct a hierarchy structure Through
    in-depth risk analysis, the indexes are separated into three levels based on logical
    relationships. (2) Establish a comparison matrix The matrix can be obtained via
    comparison in pairs in the third-level indicator layer to identify the proportion
    of each index in this layer relative to the previous one, namely the criterion
    class. 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 is utilized to represent the contrasting results. Table 2 lists a
    scale of 1 to 9, which is proposed by Saaty and generally exploited. 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 = 1
    𝑎 𝑗𝑖 (1) Table 2. Comparison scale and corresponding definition. The pairwise
    comparison matrix A is established as presented in Equation (2) 𝐴= ( 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 ) 𝑛×𝑛
    = ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ 𝑎 11 … 𝑎 𝑛1 𝑎 11 … 𝑎 𝑛2 …  … 𝑎 1𝑛 … 𝑎 𝑛𝑛 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ (2) (1)
    Calculate weight and implement consistency test The hierarchical ranking is applied
    to test the impact degree of factors at the lower level in contrast with the upper
    one. The sorting can be acquired founded on index weight. Here, 𝜔 𝑖 acts as the
    weight of 𝑖 . The maximum eigenvalue is derived, which meets 𝐴𝑊= 𝜆 max 𝑊  as well
    as the normalized eigenvector 𝑊={ 𝜔 1 , 𝜔 2 ,…, 𝜔 𝑛 } , ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 𝜔 𝑖 =1 , where
    W stands for the weight of each index relative to the upper layer. The momentous
    promise for the application of AHP is the consistency of the comparison matrix,
    or else the judgment error will occur. The test standard is elaborated as: If
    𝜆=𝑛 , A can be recognized as a uniform matrix, where 𝜆 equals the maximum eigenvalue
    in n × n reciprocal matrix A. In comparison with judge consistency degree, CI,
    RI together, with CR are cited in the paper. 𝐶𝐼= 𝜆−𝑛 𝑛−1 (3) The value of 𝑅𝐼 is
    displayed in Table 3. Table 3. RI. Normally, if the consistency ratio 𝐶𝑅= 𝐶𝐼 𝑅𝐼
    <0.1 , it is assumed that the inconsistency degree is credible. Moreover, the
    normalized eigenvector is taken as the weight vector of the index system. Otherwise,
    A requires a tune-up. 3.1.2. MTOPSIS The positive and negative ideal solutions
    are endowed with novel definitions in MTOPSIS. It is reckoned that the aforementioned
    solutions pertain to an absolute condition, and the assessment target is always
    between them; namely, the examined risk of ecological agriculture project is not
    able to be lower than the absolute negative ideal solution, nor higher than the
    absolute positive one [31]. The determination of the absolute solutions rests
    with the actual situation or experienced experts. The improvement of the MTOPSIS
    method can eliminate the possible reverse order problems in TOPSIS evaluation.
    The synthetic evaluation procedures of MTOPSIS are illustrated here [32,33,34,35]:
    (1) Equations (4) and (5) construct the weighted judgment matrix. 𝑅= ( 𝑟 𝑖𝑗 )
    𝑚×𝑛 (4) 𝑟 𝑖𝑗 = 𝑤 𝑗 ⋅ 𝑥 ∗ 𝑖𝑗 ;𝑖=1,2,⋯,𝑚;𝑗=1,2,⋯,𝑛 (5) (2) The absolute positive
    along with negative ideal solutions are determined as follows: 𝑋 + =( 𝑟 + 1 ,
    𝑟 + 2 , 𝑟 + 3 ,⋯, 𝑟 + 𝑚 ) (6) 𝑋 − =( 𝑟 − 1 , 𝑟 − 2 , 𝑟 − 3 ,⋯, 𝑟 − 𝑚 ) (7) On
    account of the standardization of raw data, the absolute solutions are commonly
    set based on Equations (8) and (9), partly. 𝑋 + = (1,1,⋯,1) T (8) 𝑋 − = (0,0,⋯,0)
    T (9) (3) The Euclidean distance can be measured as presented in Equations (10)
    and (11). 𝐷 + = ∑ 𝑗=1 𝑛 𝑤 𝑗 ( 𝑋 + − 𝑥 ∗ 𝑖𝑗 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − − −  ⎷
      (10) 𝐷 − = ∑ 𝑗=1 𝑛 𝑤 𝑗 ( 𝑋 − − 𝑥 ∗ 𝑖𝑗 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − − −  ⎷
      (11) (4) The relative closeness degree can be computed according to Equation
    (12): 𝐶 𝑖 = 𝐷 − 𝐷 + + 𝐷 − (12) (5) The assessment objects are sorted founded on
    the value of 𝐶 𝑖 , that is, the comprehensive appraisal score. The larger value
    signifies lower risk in the project. 3.2. Improved SVM Considering the disadvantages
    of artificial neural network, such as overfitting and easy falling into local
    optimal and result selection, SVM cannot only effectively solve the above problems
    but also is suitable for dealing with nonlinear and high-dimensional data, etc.,
    and has been widely used in pattern recognition, data mining, and other fields.
    In this paper, SVM is selected as the basic model. However, when the SVM model
    is used in practice, there will be some problems with whether the model parameters
    are reasonably selected. Improper parameter selection will seriously affect the
    computational performance of the model. Therefore, this paper uses the BSO algorithm
    to optimize the key parameters of SVM. This model combines the respective advantages
    of the above two algorithms in order to achieve accurate, self-learning, self-adjustment,
    strong adaptability, and highly reliable ecological agriculture project risk assessment
    function. 3.2.1. SVM {( 𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑖 ), 𝑖=1,2,…} is exploited as the training set
    in SVM, wherein {( 𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑦 𝑖 ), 𝑖=1,2,…} and 𝑦 𝑖 ∈𝑅 stands for the i-th input
    and its desired output, respectively, d equals the dimension of influencing elements
    [36]. First of all, the insensitive loss function is displayed in Equation (13),
    where 𝜀 represents the corresponding parameter. |𝑓(𝑥)−𝑦| 𝜀 ={ |𝑓(𝑥)−𝑦|−𝜀 0 |𝑓(𝑥)−𝑦|≥𝜀
    |𝑓(𝑥)−𝑦|<𝜀 (13) The kernel function is expressed as follows in which 𝜑(𝑥) is a
    nonlinear function in effect: 𝑘( 𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑥 𝑗 )=𝜑( 𝑥 𝑖 )⋅𝜑( 𝑥 𝑗 ) (14) Thus, the
    inner product operation in high-dimensional space can be realized via functions
    in input one. Then, establish the optimal decision-making function as shown in
    Equation (15): 𝑓(𝑥)=𝑤⋅𝜑(𝑥)+𝑏 (15) where ⋅ indicates the inner product in the study.  𝜔∈
    𝑅 𝑑 along with 𝑏∈𝑅 means the weight vector and bias, respectively. In the end,
    the problem can be optimized through relaxation variables 𝜉 𝑖 together with 𝜉
    ∗ 𝑖 . min 1 2 ‖𝑤‖ 2 +𝐶 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑙 ( 𝜉 𝑖 + 𝜉 ∗ 𝑖 ) (16) 𝑆.𝑡. ⎧ ⎩ ⎨     𝑦 𝑖 −𝑤⋅𝜑(
    𝑥 𝑗 )−𝑏≤𝜀+ 𝜉 𝑖 𝑤⋅𝜑( 𝑥 𝑗 )+𝑏− 𝑦 𝑖 ≤𝜀+ 𝜉 ∗ 𝑖 𝜉 𝑖 , 𝜉 ∗ 𝑖 ≥0 (17) This approach takes
    advantage of the Lagrange function for dual optimization solution with penalty
    parameter 𝐶 . 𝑀𝑎𝑥 ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ − 1 2 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑙 ∑ 𝑗=1 𝑙 ( 𝑎 𝑖 − 𝑎 ∗ 𝑖 )( 𝑎 𝑗 − 𝑎 ∗ 𝑗 )𝑘(
    𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑥 𝑗 )− ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑙 𝑎 𝑖 ( 𝑦 𝑖 −𝜀)+ ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑙 𝑎 ∗ 𝑖 ( 𝑦 𝑖 −𝜀) ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ (18) 𝑆.𝑡.
    ⎧ ⎩ ⎨         ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑙 ( 𝑎 𝑖 − 𝑎 ∗ 𝑖 )=0 0≤ 𝑎 𝑖 ,   𝑎 ∗ 𝑖 ≤𝐶 (19) The decision
    function is derived from Equation (20) 𝑓(𝑥)= ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑙 ( 𝑎 𝑖 − 𝑎 ∗ 𝑖 )𝑘( 𝑥 𝑖 ,𝑥)+𝑏
    (20) Karush–Kuhn–Tucker’s condition provides a way for the calculation of the
    bias 𝑏 . { 𝑏= 𝑦 𝑖 −𝜀−𝑤⋅𝜑( 𝑥 𝑖 ) 𝑏= 𝑦 𝑖 +𝜀−𝑤⋅𝜑( 𝑥 𝑖 ) 𝑎 𝑖 , 𝑎 ∗ 𝑖 ∈[0,𝐶] 𝑎 𝑖 ,
    𝑎 ∗ 𝑖 ∉[0,𝐶] (21) The performance of SVM depends on kernel function selection
    to a great extent. In this paper, the Gaussian radial basis kernel function is
    adopted in light of fine separability and locality that points to model learning
    as well as training [37]. The width of the kernel parameter is set as 𝜎 . 𝐾( 𝑥
    𝑖 , 𝑥 𝑗 )=exp ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ − ‖ 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑥 𝑗 ‖ 2 2 𝜎 2 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ (22) 3.2.2. Parameter Determination
    of SVM Model There are three chief parameters related to the algorithm performance
    [38] explained as follows: Penalty parameter 𝐶 indicates the degree of punishment
    while the error > 𝜀 . The error will be increased by over or under-learning, which
    corresponds to the deviation of 𝐶 . Hence, the appropriate value provides a guarantee
    for error minimization [39]. The parameter in insensitive loss function 𝜀 manifests
    the expected error. Too large 𝜀 will reduce prediction accuracy while the too
    small value will increase the dimension. Accordingly, proper 𝜀 makes assurance
    for forecasting accuracy and avoidance of dimension disaster [40]. The width of
    kernel parameter 𝜎 is associated with the high-dimensional spatial structure as
    well as optimal solution complication in the SVM model. Too large 𝜎 contributes
    to the increase in both training and testing errors, in turn too small 𝜎 conduces
    to larger testing errors and lower training ones. Consequently, the generalization
    capability of this method hinges on a reasonable value of 𝜎 [41]. Rational parameter
    selection in SVM is a crucial step in practical application connected with classification
    performance and generalization ability. This process can be deemed as a search
    for a feasible solution that satisfies the minimum generalization error in essence.
    Every spot in the search space is treated as the perspective solution and its
    generalization performance is evaluated subsequently. As a result of the distinctive
    evolution mechanism in BSO, diverse clustering groups can be availably exploited
    for the broad search for an optimal solution that is conducive to preventing the
    algorithm from falling into the local optimum [42]. Therefore, this study applies
    BSO to parameter optimization in SVM. The imitation of brainstorming meetings
    provides the basis for the BSO algorithm. Here each population denotes a group
    of ideas that stands for solutions. In the course of the execution of each iteration,
    massive ideas will be replaced. The concrete calculation of BSO is stated as follows,
    including grouping, substitution, and invention [43]: (1) Implement initialization
    on the parameters. (2) N individuals are stochastically created in the feasible
    region, and the corresponding fitness values are computed. (3) Divide N feasible
    solutions into M classes using the K-means clustering method in line with parallelism.
    (4) With regard to i = 1:M 1) The fitness of the individuals in the cluster is
    calculated, and the optimal one is elected as the kernel of the cluster. 2) Generate
    a probability value r1 stochastically. If r1 is less than the randomly set possibility
    Pone_center, substitute the center point with a novel individual. (5) With regard
    to i = 1:N 1) r2 represents a random number in [0, 1]. If r2 is less than Pone_cluster,
    stochastically choose a class ma. On the contrary, two classes of mb and mc are
    randomly selected. Then execute Step 3). 2) r3 signifies a stochastic number in
    [0, 1]. If r3 is less than Pone_center, conduct destabilization on ma for a novel
    individual. Conversely, make a random choice in the selected class for an update.
    3) r4 refers to a random number in [0, 1]. If r4 is less than Ptwo_center, integrate
    the class center of mb along with mc and put turbulence into effect for the new
    individual. Otherwise, combine the individuals partly selected from mb and mc
    and then make a disturbance. 4) The fitness of the available optimal results is
    contrasted with the novel individual. The better one will be reserved in the comparison.
    (6) Compare the individuals incorporated in all categories and treat the individual
    attaching the best fitness value as the iterative optimal solution. (7) Judge
    whether the algorithm cycle reaches the iteration limit. If it attains the extremum,
    stop the calculation; otherwise, keep on Step (3). 3.3. Framework of the Comprehensive
    Model This study put forward a hybrid evaluation approach integrating AHP-MTOPSIS
    with improved SVM based on the risk assessment indicator system of ecological
    agriculture projects, wherein the classical estimation results are acquired through
    AHP-MTOPSIS, and the BSO algorithm conduces to modification in SVM. Figure 1 displays
    the evaluation framework, which is fulfilled as follows: Figure 1. Hybrid evaluation
    process. (1) In view of the index system on ecological agriculture projects, set
    the initial input variable group 𝑋={ 𝑥 𝑖 ,𝑖=1,2,⋯,𝑛} and execute quantification
    and standardization on the original data. (2) The weight of indicators is obtained
    via AHP, and the overall assessment results can be derived from MTOPSIS. (3) The
    parameters of the BSO model are set in Table 4. Table 4. Parameters setting in
    the BSO method. (4) The crucial parameters in the SVM algorithm have respect to
    the evaluation accuracy. In this regard, BSO is utilized in the paper for parameter
    search. (5) According to the involved estimation methods, make a comparison with
    different results and conduct further analysis. 4. Experiment Analysis and Discussion
    4.1. Weight Determination Using AHP This paper selected 36 ecological agriculture
    projects in China to carry out empirical analysis. According to the above risk
    assessment and prediction model of ecological agriculture projects from the perspective
    of low carbon, the corresponding index values were substituted for calculation,
    and then the risk assessment and prediction results of ecological agriculture
    projects were obtained. First of all, based on the ecological agriculture project
    risk assessment index system established above, the index of the index layer is
    further analyzed. Through field investigation and data collection, the relevant
    data of 36 ecological agriculture projects are collected and sorted out. Meanwhile,
    35 experts are invited to score the evaluation indicators of 36 ecological agriculture
    projects according to the interval score value. Then these scores are summarized
    and sorted out, and the average value is obtained to get the data value of each
    evaluation index of 36 ecological agriculture projects. The weights of 22 indexes
    are ascertained by experts according to their relative importance and multiple
    comparisons. AHP is applied to weight calculation that satisfies the requirements
    of the consistency test. Table A1 lists the comparison matrix of second-rank indicators
    and their corresponding consequence. Additionally, the relevant information directed
    at third-rank indexes is illustrated from Table A2 to Table A7. Table 5 summarizes
    the comprehensive weights of third-rank indicators. Table 5. Calculation results
    of synthetic weights. 4.2. Assessment Analysis and Discussion through MTOPSIS
    The usefulness and reasonableness of AHP combined with MTOPSIS that points to
    risk estimation of ecological agriculture projects are validated based on 36 samples.
    First, the original data need to be normalized, as exhibited in Table A8. Table
    A9 and Table A10 indicate the weighted judgment matrix as well as Euclidean distance
    partly. Table 6 and Figure 2 both describe the relative closeness of assessment
    projects. Figure 2. Training and testing results. Note: (a) shows the results
    from samples Y1 to Y9; (b) shows the results from samples Y10 to Y18; (c) shows
    the results from samples Y19 to Y27; (d) shows the results from samples Y28 to
    Y36. Table 6. The relative closeness of estimation targets. It can be seen from
    Table 6 that the comprehensive risk evaluation of each ecological agriculture
    project rank from first to third is Y3, Y8, and Y11, while the assessment of Y4
    is the worst. The estimation consequence substantially coincides with the fact.
    Thereby, the administration branches can excavate causes and implement targeted
    approaches to lessen the risks of ecological agriculture projects. 4.3. Analysis
    and Discussion The samples are divided into two parts: the former 24 targets and
    the latter 12 objects are selected as the training and test set, respectively.
    Simultaneously, the comparison measures incorporate BPNN, SVM, along with GA-SVM.
    The training and testing results are clearly shown in Figure 2, and the relative
    errors are manifested in Figure 3. Figure 3. Relative errors. In addition, in
    order to assess the performance of the intelligent techniques, three criteria
    are adopted here, that is, root means square error (RMSE), mean absolute error
    (MAE), the sum of squared errors (SSE) as well as mean absolute percentage error
    (MAPE) [44,45,46,47], as presented in Table 7. Table 7. Evaluation criteria of
    intelligent approaches. According to the above figures and tables, the discussion
    is made as follows: (1) Based on the proximity of assessment results derived from
    intelligent techniques to AHP-MTOPSIS, the top two are BSO-SVM and GA-SVM. On
    the one hand, it is demonstrated that the BSO-SVM method is superior in estimation
    precision and model stability. On the other hand, critical parameter selection
    of SVM strengthens the nonlinear fitting and learning ability. (2) As shown in
    Figure 3, the relative error is minimum between the risk prediction results of
    BSO-SVM and AHP-TOPSIS. The absolute values of relative errors that correspond
    to BSO-SVM, GA-SVM, SVM, and SVM are [0.98%, 4.46%], [2.53%, 6.49%], [5.45%, 9.7%],
    and [5.53%, 9.95%], respectively. Wherein most relative errors of the aforementioned
    techniques are located in the range of [0, 5%], [3%, 6%], [5%, 9%], and [8%, 10%].
    (3) BSO-SVM outperforms other models in evaluation performance allowing for the
    three criteria. 5. Conclusions Risk mitigation of ecological agriculture projects
    is conducive to sustainable growth that can provide more sufficient power for
    a low-carbon economy. Thus, to promote risk reduction, this study develops an
    indicator system and a new heuristic algorithm. Firstly, the risk assessment index
    system of the ecological agriculture project was constructed from six aspects,
    namely, nature, society, market economy, management, technology, and finance,
    with a total of 23 indicators, which could systematically and comprehensively
    reflect the factors affecting the risk of ecological agriculture project. Then,
    the modified TOPSIS is applied to evaluation based on weight determination derived
    from AHP. Additionally, the BSO algorithm is exploited to improve SVM for intelligent
    assessment. The case study verified the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed
    evaluation model. The classical evaluation model can obtain accurate reference
    results, but it can be found that its calculation process is more complex, while
    the modern intelligent evaluation model can achieve rapid calculation and support
    related decisions. Compared with GA-SVM, SVM, and BPNN models, RMSE, MAE, SSE,
    and MAPE of the proposed model are all optimal values, indicating that the evaluation
    results are more accurate and stable, which fully indicates that the proposed
    model proposed can be used in the risk assessment of ecological agriculture projects.
    At the same time, the evaluation model constructed in this paper can not only
    reduce the risks faced by the project to a minimum degree and reduce losses but
    also fully expand the favorable part of the risks, actively utilize the risks,
    enhance the project benefits, and further promote the realization of the goal
    of “carbon neutrality”. Author Contributions Conceptualization, Y.L.; methodology,

    1 Introduction Small-scale bakeries are of key importance to the economic development
    of the European Union (Ambroziak 2002; Sikora et al. 2005; Škrbić et al. 2008).
    They are indispensable in the sustainable economic development and facilitate
    the economic growth (Pijanowski et al. 2000; Ellis 2021; Dziugan 2006). The fourth
    industrial revolution as well as increased competitive pressure from the market
    caused the emergence of unprecedented technological development as a key element
    for the development of small-scale bakeries – both on the level of technical devices,
    auxiliary devices, and the systemic reliability of the manufacturing process (Gilchrist
    2016; Schwab 2018; Kumar et al. 2019; Kabugo et al. 2020). Growing competition
    in the baking industry causes an ever-growing demand for solutions that would
    increase the reliability of all manufacturing processes (including machines and
    devices) of small-scale bakeries, thus allowing for improved quality of their
    products (Thompson 2007; Chryssolouris 2015; Hawryluk 2019). A breakthrough moment
    of qualitative influence on the changes in the robotisation of manufacturing lines
    can be seen in the emergence of industrial robots in small baking enterprises
    (Lasi et al. 2014; Miśkiewicz et al. 2020; Foidl et al. 2016). Robotisation is
    a major technological step for the branch under scrutiny in this paper (Bauernhansl
    et al. 2015; Bauer 2014; Santos et al. 2017). Definitive gains from its implementation
    and use of robotisation in manufacturing processes are seen in the aspects of
    direct impact of reliability in bakery manufacturing lines (Drozd 2021, Drozd
    2020a, b, Drozd and Piwnik 2019a). The definition of reliability may encompass
    varied requirements described with technical, economic, and sociological characteristics
    of objects (Fidelis et al., 2006; Macha 2001). In it, we see (Migdalski 2018;
    Nadolny 1999; Słowiński 2002]—technical reliability that takes into account technical
    characteristics,—technical–economic reliability that encompasses technical and
    economic characteristics,—global reliability which encompasses technical, economic,
    and social characteristics of its objects. The goal of the article is to introduce
    two representations of reliability of a functioning manufacturing system in the
    process of making bread in small-scale bakeries. Reliability is understood as
    one of the representations of an operator acting on specific streams in time to
    to t. One of these represents the global reliability of a system as a function
    of parallel action of all the streams of the system in time to to t and is denoted
    as Pg (t). The second representation of reliability is a scalar value, Pss. (Drozd
    and Piwnik 2019b). Pss is an average relation in time to to t of the delivery
    of the process, a quotient of the important relations to the sum of all the relations
    between process elements. Pss is called the stream-systemic reliability (Drozd
    and Piwnik 2021; Drozd and Wolniak 2021). Reliability is mainly related to the
    technical, physical, and organisational structure of the elements of a manufacturing
    system established in a way that would ensure the fulfillment of the designated
    functions (Thoft–Christensen et al. 2000; Warszyński 2000). Subject literature
    distinguishes the notion of initial reliability, at the point of the start of
    work, and the functional reliability, defined by the impact of time of the analysed
    element on its reliability (Powierża 2007; Bhowmik et al. 2018). The reliability
    function is constructed on the basis of experimental data and practical knowledge
    of system work and properties (Pogorzelski 2009; Cempel 2006). Active work of
    a system up to the first failure, or denial of service, is of random character.
    Therefore, reliability can be the probability of performing certain tasks (orders)
    issued to interrelated elements (Bijan et al. 2012; Blanchard et al. 2021). Active
    functioning of a system is therefore a set of its cooperating elements (Sienkiewicz
    2008). A system, according to its definition, cannot contain elements that do
    not cooperate among themselves. In each, system a manufacturing system in particular,
    there exist: energy streams \\(\\phi_{{\\text{E}}}\\), material (technical means)
    streams \\(\\phi_{{\\text{M}}}\\), information technology streams \\(\\phi_{{\\text{I}}}\\),
    time streams \\(\\phi_{{\\text{T}}}\\), and financial streams \\(\\phi_{{\\text{F}}}\\).
    Activity of a system can be synonymous to an organised set of relations between
    the elements of the abovementioned streams (Drozd 2020a, b). Knowledge of probability
    of failure-free work in a given time that functions in an interrelated system
    of stream elements can form a basis to determine the reliability of a whole system.
    Therefore, reliability may be one of the metrisable measures of the functioning
    of a system. 2 Matherials and methods In this section we have described the basis
    of the concept used in the paper to prepare our new innovative method of measure
    representation of reliability of a functioning manufacturing system in the case
    of process of bread production in small bakeries. We presented here the analysis
    of the mathematical symbols and it’s managerial representatives we have used in
    the paper. Also we have described method used in the analysis. The main method
    we use in this paper to analyses the scientific problem is stream analysis and
    the use of stream representation to technical and managerial problems. A technological
    system is a set of system streams (\\(\\phi_{{\\text{E}}}\\), \\(\\phi_{{\\text{M}}}\\),
    \\(\\phi_{{\\text{I}}}\\), \\(\\phi_{{\\text{T}}}\\), \\(\\phi_{{\\text{F}}}\\))
    and an operator, \\({\\hat{\\text{O}}}\\), whose activity on the system results
    in the product, P*, and losses, S. In different words, a technological system
    is an organised set of relations between the elements of streams, leading to the
    emergence of a product P* and inevitable losses S. To prepare the methodological
    basis for our future analysis we have prepared the model of structure of streams
    in the bakery. The relations between the stream elements are the activities of
    the system and are presented in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Source: Own elaboration Structure
    of the system of the analysed bakery. Full size image Symbolically, we can write
    down the activity of the operator \\({\\hat{\\text{O}}}\\) as: $$ {\\hat{\\text{O}}}\\left[
    {\\phi_{{\\text{E}}} ,\\,\\phi_{{\\text{M}}} ,\\,\\phi_{{\\text{I}}} ,\\,\\phi_{{\\text{T}}}
    ,\\,\\phi_{{\\text{F}}} } \\right] \\to {\\text{P}}^{*} + {\\text{S}} $$ (1) From
    the definitions of the technological system, Fig. 1, and the Eq. (1) we deduce
    the synonymity of a system with action. A technological system does not function
    without actions, i.e. relations between the elements of the streams. The streams
    are inputs into the system and differ according to their role, form, subject,
    and number of elements. The \\(\\phi_{{\\text{i E}}}\\) energy stream is set of
    i-elements of converting and transmitting electric, mechanical, heat, and other
    energy needed to perform the tasks of the project. The \\(\\phi_{{\\text{j M}}}\\)
    matter stream is a set of j-elements that guarantee the material security of the
    project. These are raw materials, machines, and installations. The \\(\\phi_{{\\text{k
    I}}}\\) information stream is a set of k-elements of organised instructions, algorithms,
    orders, guidelines, and the elements of the recent applied knowledge which guarantee
    the highest possible quality of the activity of a technological system. The \\({
    }\\phi_{{\\text{l T}}}\\) time stream is a set of l-elements of instructions for
    technological algorithms for sequence and timing of actions. The elements of \\({
    }\\phi_{{\\text{l T}}}\\) define durations for the individual operations, functions,
    and other tasks within the process. The \\({ }\\phi_{{\\text{m F}}}\\) finance
    stream is a set of m-elements defining the costs of the activity of the system
    as trends for the demand of the product P*. Relations of the components of the
    technological system are marked by a technical-organisational-economic interrelations
    of the individual components of the same stream or of different streams that assure
    constant functioning of the system. In one of the bakeries within a group of small
    bakeries, the following relations were observed: Spiral mixer \\({ }\\phi_{{2{\\text{
    E}}}}\\), flour \\({ }\\phi_{{1{\\text{ M}}}}\\), water \\({ }\\phi_{{3{\\text{
    M}}}}\\) $$ \\left( {{ }\\phi_{{2{\\text{ E }},{ }}} { }\\phi_{{1{\\text{ M}}}}
    ,{ }\\phi_{{3{\\text{ M}}}} } \\right) $$ Proofing cabinet \\({ }\\phi_{{9{\\text{
    E}}}}\\), heater \\({ }\\phi_{{{\\text{c}}1{\\text{ E}}}}\\) , water \\({ }\\phi_{{3{\\text{
    M}}}}\\) $$ \\left( {{ }\\phi_{{9{\\text{ E }},{ }}} { }\\phi_{{{\\text{c}}1{\\text{
    E}}}} ,{ }\\phi_{{3{\\text{ M}}}} } \\right) $$ The number assignations of the
    individual elements were taken from the specification of the subject structure
    of the analysed bakery, shown later in Sect. 5. The probability of failure-free
    work in time \\(\\tau\\) from t0 to tn of the set of elements in their relation
    is marked as e.g.: $$ {\\text{P}}_{{[{\\text{to}},t]}} \\left( {{ }\\phi_{{2{\\text{
    E }},{ }}} { }\\phi_{{1{\\text{ M}}}} ,{ }\\phi_{{3{\\text{ M}}}} } \\right) ,
    $$ $$ {\\text{P}}_{{[{\\text{to}},t]}} \\left( {{ }\\phi_{{9{\\text{ E }},{ }}}
    { }\\phi_{{{\\text{c}}1{\\text{ E}}}} ,{ }\\phi_{{3{\\text{ M}}}} } \\right) $$
    More generally, reliability in time [t to tn] can be marked as: $$ {\\text{P}}_{{[{\\text{to}},t]}}
    \\left( {{ }\\phi_{{{\\text{iE }},{ }}} { }\\phi_{{{\\text{jM}}}} ,\\phi_{{{\\text{kI}}}}
    , { }\\phi_{{{\\text{lT}}}} , { }\\phi_{{{\\text{mF}}}} } \\right) $$ The above
    take into the account knowledge of probability of the related elements to work
    failure-free at the time t = 0. For instance, \\({\\text{P}}_{{{\\text{t}} = {\\text{to}}}}
    \\left( {{ }\\phi_{{2{\\text{ E }},{ }}} { }\\phi_{{1{\\text{ M}}}} ,{ }\\phi_{{3{\\text{
    M}}}} } \\right) = 1\\). The above means complete readiness of the elements of
    the described relation to work at the onset of the manufacturing process. The
    actual streams: \\({ }\\phi_{{\\text{iE }}}\\)[to, t], \\({ }\\phi_{{{\\text{jM}}}}\\)[to,
    t], \\(\\phi_{{{\\text{kI}}}}\\)[to, t], \\(\\phi_{{{\\text{lT}}}}\\)[to, t],\\({
    }\\phi_{{{\\text{mF}}}}\\)[to, t] acting in time to to t in the manufacturing
    process differ from their normative values, i.e. values that are designated with
    the use of algorithms and that represent theoretical activity, resulting from
    current state of knowledge of manufacturing the resultant product. Normative streams
    are designated as: \\({ }\\phi^{{\\text{n}}}_{{\\text{iE }}}\\)[to, t], \\({ }\\phi^{{\\text{n}}}_{{{\\text{jM}}}}\\)[to,
    t], \\(\\phi^{{\\text{n}}}_{{{\\text{kI}}}}\\)[to, t], \\(\\phi^{{\\text{n}}}_{{{\\text{lT}}}}\\)[to,
    t],\\({ }\\phi^{{\\text{n}}}_{{{\\text{mF}}}}\\)[to, t]. Differences between the
    normative and actual values of the streams in relation to their actual values
    in the same timespan t will be further referred to as a non-dimensional arguments
    of the global reliability function Pg (t) of the manufacturing system. The second
    part of this chapter will concentrate on analysis of global reliability of manufacturing
    system. We put there the methodology how the particular streams will be calculated
    in the paper. In the following part of the paper we use those conception to calculate
    mentioned strings on the example of an bakery. Global reliability of a manufacturing
    system will be assigned to a metrisable measure of activity of elements of a stream
    in time t0 to t, which represents the probability of the readiness to perform
    failure-free work of the whole system in time t. Therefore, global reliability
    of a manufacturing system is a function in time t and will be marked as Pg (t).
    The function Pg (t) has a value of one at time to, which denotes the system’s
    readiness at the beginning of the process, and a value of less or equal to one
    at any given time of the manufacturing process. The function Pg (t) in its meaning
    as the global reliability of a manufacturing system is defined as a product of
    reliability of each of the system’s streams. Therefore: $$ {\\text{P}}_{{{\\text{g}}\\,\\,[{\\text{to}},t]}}^{{\\text{t}}}
    = {\\text{P}}_{{\\text{E}}}^{{\\left( {\\text{t}} \\right)}} \\,{\\text{P}}_{{\\text{M}}}^{{\\left(
    {\\text{t}} \\right)}} \\,{\\text{P}}_{{\\text{I}}}^{{\\left( {\\text{t}} \\right)}}
    \\,{\\text{P}}_{{\\text{T}}}^{{\\left( {\\text{t}} \\right)}} \\,{\\text{P}}_{{\\text{F}}}^{{\\left(
    {\\text{t}} \\right)}} $$ (2) Individual stream reliabilities are marked as: (a)
    energy stream reliability $$ {\\text{P}}_{{\\text{E}}}^{{\\left( {\\text{t}} \\right)}}
    = {1} - \\frac{{\\left| {\\phi_{{{\\text{iE}}}}^{{ \\left( {\\text{t}} \\right)}}
    - \\phi_{{{\\text{iE}}}}^{{{\\text{n }}\\left( {\\text{t}} \\right)}} } \\right|}}{{\\phi_{{{\\text{iE}}}}^{{{\\text{n

    $$ {\\text{P}}_{{\\text{I}}}^{{\\left( {\\text{t}} \\right)}} = {1} - \\frac{{\\left|

    {\\text{t}} \\right)}} - \\phi_{{{\\text{lT}}}}^{{{\\text{n }}\\left( {\\text{t}}
    \\right)}} } \\right|}}{{\\phi_{{{\\text{lT}}}}^{{{\\text{n }}\\left( {\\text{t}}
    \\right)}} }} $$ (6) (e) finance stream reliability $$ {\\text{P}}_{{\\text{F}}}^{{\\left(
    {\\text{t}} \\right)}} = {1} - \\frac{{\\left| {\\phi_{{{\\text{mF}}}}^{{ \\left(
    {\\text{t}} \\right)}} - \\phi_{{{\\text{mF}}}}^{{{\\text{n }}\\left( {\\text{t}}
    \\right)}} } \\right|}}{{\\phi_{{{\\text{mF}}}}^{{{\\text{n }}\\left( {\\text{t}}
    \\right)}} }} $$ (7) Reliability of the streams: PE(t), PM(t), PI(t), PT(t), PF(t)
    is defined as a difference between the value of one and the fraction of the modules
    of differences between the real and normative values of the streams at a given
    time t, in reference to their nominal values. The formula \\({\\text{P}}_{{\\text{g}}}^{{
    \\left( {\\text{t}} \\right)}}\\)[to, t] as a function of global reliability of
    the manufacturing process, a product of five reliabilities of the system streams,
    combines the activities of all the elements of a system at the time t. Global
    system reliability \\({\\text{P}}_{{\\text{g}}}^{{ \\left( {\\text{t}} \\right)}}\\)[to,t]
    is derived from actual measurements of stream expenses in relation to their nominal
    values derived from a theoretical model. Functions of global reliability need
    to be presented in non-dimensional time in reference to the actual process time
    Tp as: $$ {\\text{t}}_{{\\text{b}}} = \\frac{{\\text{t}}}{{{\\text{T}}_{{\\text{p}}}
    }} $$ (8) The research we described in the paper was conducted in the year 2021
    in small bakeries in Pomerania region in Poland. To calculate all the streams
    we have measured all the parameters. The extensive analysis of the organization
    we have made the research and the data to calculate strings are in the chapter
    4. The presented global reliability of the production system—supported by the
    formulas for individual flow reliability—assumes the further part of their research
    and its implementation to small enterprises in the baking industry. 3 Stream-systemic
    reliability of a manufacturing process Stream-systemic reliability Pss [to,t]
    is defined as the probability of failure-free work of the whole technological
    system, i.e. the full set of component relations. Stream-systemic reliability
    Pss [to,t] is defined as the quotient of the sum of important relations to the
    sum of important and auxiliary relations. Therefore, stream-systemic reliability
    is defined as the average probability of failure-free work of a system in technological
    time \\(\\tau\\) \\(\\in \\)[t0,t]. Numerical value Pss is found on a continuum
    between zero and one: $$ 0 < {\\text{P}}_{{{\\text{ss}}}} < {1} $$ (9) The formula
    for Pss is as follows: $$ {\\text{P}}_{{{\\text{SS}}}} = \\frac{{{\\Sigma }_{{{\\text{s}}
    = 1}}^{{\\text{r}}} {\\text{P}}_{{\\text{s}}}^{{\\text{ I}}} \\left[ {{\\text{t}}_{0,}
    {\\text{t}}} \\right]}}{{{\\Sigma }_{{{\\text{s}} = 1}}^{{\\text{r}}} {\\text{P}}_{{\\text{s}}}^{{\\text{
    I}}} \\left[ {{\\text{t}}_{0} {\\text{,t}}} \\right] + {\\Sigma }_{{{\\text{s}}
    = 1}}^{{\\text{z}}} {\\text{P}}_{{\\text{s}}}^{{\\text{ W}}} \\left[ {{\\text{t}}_{0}
    {\\text{,t}}} \\right]}} $$ (10) In the formula (10) the index s denotes the number
    of the relation, t stands for the number of important relations, and z stands
    for the number of supportive relations. The value of Pss is not a function of
    reliability but rather a scalar value representing averages of reliability of
    the whole system in time \\(\\tau\\) \\(\\in \\)[t0,t]. The construction of the
    stream-systemic reliability formula (10) also provides guidelines as to the optimisation
    of the structure of the system. This is related to the number of supportive relations
    whose growth lowers the reliability, while the increase of the number of important
    relations improves reliability. Therefore, implementations and technical innovations
    ought to be directed at growing important relations, e.g. through the introduction
    of robotisation. 3.1 Important and supportive relations Stream-systemic reliability
    (Pss) is one of the metrisable values of the system operator \\({\\hat{\\text{O}}}
    \\) acting on streams (energy, matter, information, time, and finances). Stream-systemic
    reliability is a ratio of the number of reliabilities of important associations
    and system element relations on one side and the sum of important and supportive
    relations on the other. Important relations are related to the direct \\({\\hat{\\text{O}}}
    \\) system operator relations, where the operator acts on individual streams:
    energy, matter, information, time, and finances. Supportive relations are related
    to only those relations that support the process of important relations. Important
    relations are characterised by reliability of one, while supportive relations
    bear the reliability of zero to one. While studying and comparing important relations
    between the individual streams, we need to take into account a few criteria which
    are dominant on their activity. We may enumerate the following properties of such
    relations: 1. Strict character A system ought to be defined so as for an observer
    to be able to say what forms part of the system and what does not. A definition
    of a system may be set in general terms, but not too vague. 2. Invariability The
    definition of a system ought to be invariable all along the course of scrutiny.
    It is not permitted for some elements to be treated as part of the system at one
    time and not belonging to the system at another. 3. Completeness The division
    of a system into subsystems ought to be complete. This means the system may not
    include elements that do not belong to any of its subsystems. 4. Separation Division
    into subsystems ought to be separate. This means the system may not contain elements
    that form part of different subsystems at the same time. Belonging of elements
    to a subsystem must therefore be synonymous with them not belonging to any other
    subsystem. 5. Functionality Systems ought to be defined by the functions they
    perform, not by their spatial separation. Important relations PI [to,t] are associations
    of elements of the abovementioned manufacturing stream components whose cooperation
    in normative technological time \\(\\tau \\in \\)[t0,t] is delivered with the
    value of expected non-failure operations: $$ {\\text{P}}^{{\\text{I}}}_{{[{\\text{to}},{\\text{t}}]}}
    = {1}. $$ Reliability of important relations, with the value of 1, is postulated
    based on the study of the system, experience, tradition, and the newest verified
    technological practice with the implication of innovations. Reliability of some
    of the important relations can be even defined without studies. Knowledge is derived
    from experience in such cases. Defining those important relations which do not
    require specific research needs high expertise of the management. Supportive relations
    Pw [to,t] contain values for failure-free operation of the associated manufacturing
    stream elements in technological time [t0,t] as: $$ 0 < {\\text{P}}^{{\\text{w}}}_{{[{\\text{to}},{\\text{t}}]}}
    < {1} $$ (11) Supportive relations can be partially necessary, providing the continuity
    of the full functionality of the system, therefore they are related to such associations
    of technological stream components whose failure will only worsen the operation
    of a system. It is assumed that such failure will not result in the failure of
    the system as a whole. A full set of supporting relations requires high expertise
    of engineering staff. 4 Analysis of the global reliability and stream-systemic
    reliability of a manufacturing system based on small-scale bakeries In order to
    illustrate the applicability of the calculations of the flow of global and stream-systemic
    reliability of a manufacturing process for a manufacturing business, we analysed
    one of the bakeries operating in the Pomerania area of Poland. Systemic analysis
    of the business revealed the need to introduce robotisation. The spatial distribution
    of manufacturing facilities in halls before the robotisation process has been
    implemented is shown in Fig. 2, while the same facilities and halls after the
    robotisation process has been completed are shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Source: Own
    elaboration on the analysed bakery Spatial distribution of manufacturing facilities
    and halls before the robotisation process in the analysed bakery. Full size image

    process is most often kept under a secrecy clause. In this case, a detailed technological
    specification of the manufacturing process was prepared. The select elements are

    and following the robotisation process. The flow of the global reliability of
    a manufacturing system for selected bakery products in non-dimensional time \\({\\text{P}}_{{\\text{g}}}^{{\\left(
    {\\text{t}} \\right)}}\\)[to, t] for the traditional and robotised bakery are
    shown in Figs. 3, 4 Fig. 3 Source: Own work Flow of the global manufacturing reliability
    function for a traditional bakery Full size image Fig. 4 Source: Own work Flow
    of the global manufacturing reliability function for a robotic bakery. Full size
    image The measurements and study showed in a definite way that the value of the
    global reliability \\({\\text{P}}_{{\\text{g}}}^{{\\left( {{\\text{tb}}} \\right)}}\\)
    in non-dimensional time of manufacturing tb in a robotised bakery is higher than
    the corresponding values for a traditional bakery by an average of 9%. Tables
    for important and supportive relations were implemented. The research clearly
    shows that the important relation for a traditional bakery count Pi = 1292 while
    for supportive relations it is Pw = 920. In a robotised bakery, the count of important
    relations is Pi = 2756 and for the supportive relations it is Pw = 573. The robotisation
    of the bakery under study increased the number of important relations by more
    than twofold. Stream-systemic reliability in a traditional bakery is 58.41%. $$
    {\\text{P}}_{{{\\text{ss}}}} = \\frac{1292}{{1292 + 920}} = 0.{5841} $$ Stream-systemic
    reliability in a robotised bakery is 73.61% $$ {\\text{P}}_{{{\\text{ss}}}} =
    \\frac{2156}{{2156 + 773}} = 0.{7361} $$ Robotisation of a bakery significantly
    improves the reliability of the bread baking process and is of significant importance
    to the increase of manufacturing efficiency and quality of the final product.
    5 Discussion Formulating the reliability of a manufacturing process as a function
    in time is of fundamental importance to the formulating the description of the
    connection of the reliability with the final product, therefore, seeking the way
    of defining such functions, which are based on the assessment of the reliability
    of individual system streams. This allows for an analysis of the individual streams’
    impact on overall quality. The presented approach is empirical and analytical
    in nature, as it requires detailed measurements with the real and algorithmic
    expenses of the streams. This requires a lot of work, calling for further improvement
    in automation and the application of artificial intelligence. Analysis of the
    important and supportive relations of the system elements are less resource consuming
    and leads to the simplified variant of calculations, Pss. In each case, as the
    paper shows, the averages for both ways of calculating reliability do not differ
    from one another. Therefore, for the baking industry, either of the solutions
    is recommended, depending on the company’s capabilities and needs. The results
    of reliability analysis in manufacturing processes show the applicability of vector
    and stream analysis to the issues of quality within a manufacturing process. In
    this context, vector methods have so far not been practiced. Nonetheless, this
    concept was previously applied especially in technical sciences to solve problems.
    For instance, vector methods were applied in: nanostructure analysis (Zhao et
    al. 2021), forecasting in the energy sector (Yousaf et al. 2021; Aslam et al.
    2021], e-business modelling (Sun et al. 2021), machine learning (Shahpouri et
    al. 2021), or issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic (Alghazzawi et al. 2021;
    Scuttari et al. 2021; Ting et al. 2020). The paper’s proposed solutions require
    a digitisation of the manufacturing process. Only this process will allow to obtain
    data that in turn allows the implementation of stream analysis in the manufacturing
    process. Digitisation of processes (Gajdzik et al. 2021; Kordel et al. 2021; Liu
    et al. 2021; Akazi et al. 2020; Pirocă et al. 2021) in a manufacturing business
    is employed increasingly often and forms one of the key factors of introducing
    Industry 4.0 (Miśkiewicz et al. 2020; Gajdzik et al. 2021; Stawiarska 2021; Pirocă
    et al. 2021). Also, robotisation is a prerequisite element for implementing Industry
    4.0 in business (Botlíková et al. 2020; Siderska 2021; Marinoudi et al. 2021).
    It seems that this paper’s proposed solutions may allow bakeries to adjust themselves
    to the requirements of Industry 4.0. Ideas in implementing Industry 4.0 in the
    baking industry were voiced by e.g. A. Lindhal (Lindhal 2019). The author emphasises
    that issues of data digitisation and analysis in manufacturing processes are the
    most crucial element for the implementation of Industry 4.0 in a bakery. She also
    points to the importance of robotising the manufacturing processes (Lindhal 2019).
    According to the presented theoretical concepts, we may conclude that full implementation
    of stream and vector analysis in the practice of operational management of a bakery
    will result in us being able to speak of new quality in a fully digitised Bakery
    4.0 (Pauliková et al. 2021). This approach will allow for better management of
    the said bakery and will create competitive advantage in the market. Bakery 4.0
    has not been frequently cited in subject literature (Bordel et al. 2021), however,
    business-related publications have raised this concept. The concept of a Bakery
    4.0 may be defined as the implementation of the methods and concepts of Industry
    4.0 in a baking business. The implementation of this paper’s proposed calculation
    methods may be an important step (article—Bakery 4.0 2021; Ting et al. 2021; Lachance
    2021) of the transformation of a Bakery 3.0 into a Bakery 4.0. As analysis of
    research of digitisation processes by G. Garcia shows, in this area, that the
    implementation of digitisation and robotisation leads to the possible improvement
    of quality (Garcia et al. 2021). Results from this paper’s research also confirm
    that robotisation of a bakery has positive influence on the reliability of bread
    baking and the improvement of quality of the final product. Analysis of research
    in optimization of bakery processes (Babor et al. 2021) suggests the current insufficient
    methods that allow detailed analysis of the functioning of the baking process;
    this gap is addressed in this paper. Our main achievements based on the data analyzed
    in the presented paper concentrate on development and usage of innovative new
    method of implementation of mathematical concept of stream analysis to managerial
    problems. We tried to implement this mathematical concept to prepare the set of
    strings which is most important to build and calculate the model of stream for
    bakery. We think it’s one of the pioneering uses of this mathematical concept
    in management. Also we have not found any usages of the stream concept in bakery
    industry. We think that solution proponed in our paper give the theoretical basis
    to the use of this concept to any production. The practical achievement of the
    paper is connected with the potential better adjustment of the bakery industry
    to the demand of XXI century business. Using the concept organization can digitalize
    it’s operation and implement the Industry 4.0 rules within the organization. Also
    our solution is one of the first concept how to fully digitalize the quality concept
    in industrial enterprise and how to use mathematic representation to calculate
    all stream connected with quality in industrial firm. 6 Conclusions The paper
    presents two new concepts of reliability of a manufacturing process, on the basis
    of a bakery. We have used two concepts to compare stream-systemic reliability
    in traditional bakery and stream-systemic reliability in robotized bakery. Each
    situation need using slightly different approach to analysis. This twofold analysis
    give as possibility to find how big was the effect on implementing robotization
    on the all processes in the organization, especially those related to quality
    of product. On the basis of our research we have observed that the implementation
    of robotization in the bakery can significantly improve the reliability of the
    bread baking process and can have positive impact on efficiency of organization
    and especially the quality of the final product. It is not possible to link those
    two concept into one because each of them can be used in various situation and
    to various problems. We think that two proponed approaches can be useful for the
    organization. The paper presents global reliability of a manufacturing process
    as a function in time, defined by the reliability of the individual manufacturing
    process streams. Reliability of streams was presented as a quotient of the difference
    of real and planned values of streams, and planned values. The global reliability
    of a manufacturing process is the product of input stream reliabilities. Values
    of streams and their variation in time has been defined empirically, in the course
    of the process. From the flows of the individual stream reliability functions,
    definitely higher reliability values of robotised bakeries can be deduced. Smaller
    businesses require the computation of stream-systemic reliabilities. This paper
    presents a new concept of stream-systemic reliability Pss. It is a scalar value,
    whose average is between zero and one. Stream-systemic reliability is one of the
    metrisable values of the system operator \\({\\hat{\\text{O}}}\\) acting on energy,
    matter, information, time, and finance streams. Stream-systemic reliability is
    the ratio of reliabilities of important associations and relations of the elements
    of the system to the sum of important and supportive relations. Important relations
    are characterised by reliability of one, while supportive relations bear the reliability
    in the continuum between zero and one. The knowledge of important relations relies
    less heavily on research, and more heavily on knowledge and experience. Therefore,
    qualification of the staff who diagnose the manufacturing system needs to be high.
    Stream-systemic reliability Pss measures the degree of failure-free operation
    of a technological process. The designation of Pss in a system relates to normative
    time and does not require high research overheads. The structure of stream-systemic
    reliability Pss points at paths of optimising the system according to the selected
    macro-indicators. The structure definitely confirms increased efficiency of the
    system through increasing the number of important relations. This means the introduction
    of higher probability of failure-free work of important relations of stream elements
    through robotisation. This is one of the ideas for improving the innovatiove character
    of manufacturing processes. The analysis in the paper, a systemic analysis of
    a small-scale bakery, based on the structure of the function \\({\\text{P}}_{{\\text{g}}}^{{\\left(
    {\\text{t}} \\right)}}\\)[to, tb] and the value of Pss has confirmed the usefulness
    of such “diagnostics” in the improvement of the efficiency of baking bread. There
    has been an observable increase of the value of Pss in a robotised bakery. The
    said increase also results in the improvement of the final product quality. The
    presented structure of global stream-systemic reliability may also be applied
    to other manufacturing processes, which, however, requires detailed systemic analysis
    of those processes. We think that in the future our research can go in two directions.
    One possible future research could be strictly connected with the bakery industry.
    We could use our method in more bakeries in Poland maybe not only small ones to
    have the bigger base of the data. The extensive statistical analysis could be
    give us the insight what are the differences according to various types of bakeries
    in the case of robotization implementation and advancement in product quality.
    Also we think that the method could be seen as universal and because of that can
    be used to analyses product quality in others industries. It is the interesting,
    perspective field of the future research. We think that we could try to modify
    the model of strings and the whole concept to analyze others industry and production
    systems. References Akazi, T., Goti, A., Oyarbide, A., Alberdi, E., Bayon, F.:

  description: Sensors have been used in various agricultural production scenarios
    due to significant advances in the Agricultural Internet of Things (Ag-IoT), leading
    to smart agriculture. Intelligent control or monitoring systems rely heavily on
    trustworthy sensor systems. Nonetheless, sensor failures are likely due to various
    factors, including key equipment malfunction or human error. A faulty sensor can
    produce corrupted measurements, resulting in incorrect decisions. Early detection
    of potential faults is crucial, and fault diagnosis techniques have been proposed.
    The purpose of sensor fault diagnosis is to detect faulty data in the sensor and
    recover or isolate the faulty sensors so that the sensor can finally provide correct
    data to the user. Current fault diagnosis technologies are based mainly on statistical
    models, artificial intelligence, deep learning, etc. The further development of
    fault diagnosis technology is also conducive to reducing the loss caused by sensor
    failures.

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract Sensors have been used in various agricultural
    production scenarios due to significant advances in the Agricultural Internet
    of Things (Ag-IoT), leading to smart agriculture. Intelligent control or monitoring
    systems rely heavily on trustworthy sensor systems. Nonetheless, sensor failures
    are likely due to various factors, including key equipment malfunction or human
    error. A faulty sensor can produce corrupted measurements, resulting in incorrect
    decisions. Early detection of potential faults is crucial, and fault diagnosis
    techniques have been proposed. The purpose of sensor fault diagnosis is to detect
    faulty data in the sensor and recover or isolate the faulty sensors so that the
    sensor can finally provide correct data to the user. Current fault diagnosis technologies
    are based mainly on statistical models, artificial intelligence, deep learning,
    etc. The further development of fault diagnosis technology is also conducive to
    reducing the loss caused by sensor failures. Keywords: agricultural Internet of
    Things; sensors; fault diagnosis; deep learning 1. Introduction The Internet of
    Things (IoT) is widely used in various fields, such as intelligent healthcare
    [1], smart agriculture [2], smart transportation [3], the smart home [4], and
    the smart city [5,6]. The agricultural Internet of Things (Ag-IoT) has been widely
    used in agricultural scenarios such as field planting, livestock and poultry breeding,
    aquaculture, facility horticulture, and agricultural product logistics traceability
    as an important development direction of “Internet +” agriculture to realize the
    comprehensive perception of the agricultural production process, intelligent decision
    analysis, and early warning, and finally achieve the goal of precision agriculture
    and intelligent agriculture. The Ag-IoT has been used for a long time in many
    countries, and the technology is relatively mature. The United States began to
    use computers for intelligent irrigation and production management in the 1980s.
    Ag-IoT coverage on large farms in the United States has reached 80%. In 2004,
    Japan’s Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications proposed the U-Japan plan,
    which included Ag-IoT technology developed primarily by NEC, Fujitsu, Hitachi,
    and Mitsui. China proposed the “Sensing China” strategy in 2009 [7], and related
    research and the application of Ag-IoT also began to develop rapidly. Sensors,
    the core of Ag-IoT, are primarily used to collect various data in the agricultural
    production process. Furthermore, sensors can be integrated with other systems
    to enhance automatic control capabilities. However, agricultural sensors are prone
    to frequent faults due to poor deployment environments and remote deployment locations.
    For example, when a temperature and humidity sensor is biased or drifts, the irrigation
    system will not work correctly [8]. If the sensor in the robot system fails, it
    may face paralysis [9,10]. Incorrect detection values of sensors will lead to
    wrong decisions in intelligent agriculture systems [11,12]. Unmanned aircraft
    may lose control or even crash due to problems with the gyroscope and accelerometer
    [13]. Due to the influence of the external environment, sensor aging is also a
    source of sensor failures, leading to incorrect decisions [14] and failure to
    transmit information normally [15]. In different application scenarios, sensor
    failures can cause significant human, economic, and environmental losses and reduce
    the quality of IoT service. Since Beard [16] proposed fault diagnosis technology
    in 1971, experts and scholars have conducted extensive research in sensor fault
    diagnosis. Figure 1 depicts the research progress of sensor fault diagnosis technology
    [16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26]. Early sensor fault diagnosis methods relied
    on experience and simple ways to pinpoint the location and cause of a problem,
    such as sensor redundancy, function redundancy, and characteristics tracking [27].
    Sensor redundancy is the use of multiple sensors to measure the same parameter,
    the linear combination of the measured values of several sensors is converted
    into an estimated value, and the final comparison of the measured value with the
    estimated value is used to determine whether faults occur. This method, however,
    raises hardware costs. Functional redundancy uses information from each sensor
    in the system to determine whether there is a fault via the relationship between
    sensors in heterogeneous and homogeneous locations. Characterization tracking
    determines whether the sensor values are within acceptable limits. Figure 1. Timeline
    of development in sensor fault diagnosis technology in Ag-IoT systems. With the
    widespread adoption of Ag-IoT and the rise of machine learning, a new method for
    sensor fault diagnosis has emerged. A fault diagnosis model that has been trained
    with a large amount of data has a faster and more accurate effect [28]. In particular,
    as deep learning exhibits powerful data representation learning and analysis capabilities,
    it can meet the requirements of high-order, nonlinear, adaptive feature extraction
    for sensor fault diagnosis [29]. A sensor fault diagnosis method based on Ag-IoT
    can overcome the limitations of early sensor fault diagnosis by fully using more
    technical support, such as machine learning, statistical analysis, and signal
    processing, to realize remote real-time online fault diagnosis, even without the
    presence of maintenance personnel. The system can diagnose itself and recover
    or isolate the corresponding fault, allowing the sensor network to continue operating
    normally after the fault occurs while improving the intelligent level of fault
    diagnosis [30]. This paper offers an overview of Ag-IoT sensor fault diagnosis
    technology. First, sensor networks and sensors are introduced, and the current
    state of sensor research is reviewed. The sensor fault is investigated using Ag-IoT
    characteristics. The common fault root causes, fault types, and sensor fault characteristics
    are discussed. The methods and strategies for detecting sensor faults are thoroughly
    examined. Finally, the future direction of sensor fault diagnosis development
    is discussed. 2. Background of Sensors and Sensor Networks in the Ag-IoT 2.1.
    Sensors and Sensor Networks Smart agriculture requires the deployment of various
    sensors on farmland, crops, animals, and agricultural equipment. High-quality,
    high-resolution, high-reliability professional agricultural sensors must be designed
    and developed to sense the physiological markers of agricultural production environments,
    animals, and plants. According to the different detection objects, sensors can
    be divided into many types, such as gas sensors, temperature and humidity sensors,
    illuminance sensors, nutrient element sensors, and so on. Sensor networks are
    broadly classified into two types: wired sensor networks and wireless sensor networks.
    Wired sensor networks do not meet the requirements of remote deployment areas,
    wide monitoring areas, and low cost due to the shortcomings of complex wiring
    and the high cost of wired sensors. In comparison, wireless sensor networks have
    the advantages of flexible installation and low cost, and they are being used
    in an increasing number of agricultural fields. The self-organization of a large
    number of wireless sensors forms a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). A WSN can remotely
    transmit data from various detection objects in the monitoring area to terminal
    users in real time and quickly. It can be deployed in remote areas to overcome
    wired limitations. A WSN consists of sensor modules, processor modules, wireless
    communication modules, and energy supply modules. The sensor module collects environmental
    information and converts the collected signal to digital analog; the processor
    module filters and processes the data; the wireless communication module sends
    the collected information to the sink node or base station; and the energy supply
    module is in charge of the entire wireless sensor’s energy supply, including power
    supply, solar power, and wind power. Wireless sensors are typically dispersed
    at random throughout the monitoring area. The collected data are transmitted multi-hop
    between nodes before being wirelessly transmitted to the base station [31]. With
    the advances in communication technology, many different types of wireless networks
    have emerged, as shown in Table 1. The deployment nodes of agricultural sensors
    can be adjusted to meet the various service requirements of agricultural applications.
    Table 1. Comparison of data transmission technologies commonly used in agricultural
    IoT. 2.2. Agricultural Internet of Things The world recognizes the IoT as the
    third wave of the world’s information industry after computers, the Internet,
    and mobile communication networks. It can realize a comprehensive network of people
    and people, people and things, and things and things. As agriculture enters the
    4.0 era, the current planting and breeding industry are showing the characteristics
    of scale and refinement through the integration of agriculture with emerging technologies
    such as the IoT, big data, artificial intelligence, etc., via various sensors
    to collect information, such as temperature, humidity, nitrate content in the
    soil, conductivity, and PH [37]. Monitoring and controlling essential factors
    that affect crop growth and yield can significantly reduce economic losses through
    the timely discovery of risks in the breeding process. The continuous emergence
    of intelligent agricultural equipment will promote the automation and intellectualization
    of agriculture. As shown in Figure 2, IoT technology is currently widely used
    in agriculture, including precision agriculture, livestock monitoring, smart greenhouses,
    fisheries management, and weather tracking [38,39]. Figure 2. Practical applications
    of IoT in agriculture. 2.3. Research Status of Ag-IoT Sensors The implementation
    of Ag-IoT systems is reliant on multi-functional intelligent sensors. The wide
    range of sensors includes agricultural environmental sensors, agricultural animal
    and plant life information sensors, agricultural product information sensors,
    and other agricultural sensors (such as position information and pressure information
    sensors). The primary function of agricultural sensors is to collect data on numerous
    agricultural factors, including temperature, humidity, light intensity, and gas
    concentration in the field planting industry; ammonia and carbon dioxide levels,
    air quality, temperature, and humidity in the livestock and poultry breeding industry;
    dissolved oxygen, salinity, carbon dioxide, and ammonium nitrogen in aquaculture;
    and temperature, humidity, light intensity, and carbon dioxide in facility horticulture.
    In terms of principle and method, agricultural sensors based on an electrical
    sensing mechanism are primarily used for temperature and humidity sensing [40].
    Sensors utilizing a photoelectric sensing mechanism are mainly employed to measure
    light intensity, gas composition, and phenotypic object displacement. Sensors
    based on an electrochemical sensing mechanism are primarily used to detect temperature,
    humidity, and gas concentrations, including oxygen, carbon dioxide, and ammonia.
    However, at present, the intelligence and technological maturity of agricultural
    environment sensors are low. Although numerous companies are conducting this type
    of sensor research, only a few companies research animal and plant physiological
    information sensors due to technological and financial limitations. Table 2 displays
    representative agricultural sensor systems in the Ag-IoT. Table 2. Representative
    agricultural sensors in a variety of Ag-IoT applications. 3. Types and Characteristics
    of Sensor Faults Sensors in the Ag-IoT structure are prone to many faults during
    data acquisition and transmission. A sensor fault refers to a sensor whose sensing
    or transmitting data is significantly different from other sensor data; the data
    don’t conform to the expected normal behavior or are highly consistent with the
    defined characteristics of fault data [63]. According to the acquisition process
    analysis, agricultural sensors are typically deployed in unattended and harsh
    indoor or outdoor environments. Wireless sensors usually have limited resources
    such as power, memory, and computing resources. Long-term use damages the sensor
    module, power module, and other wireless sensor hardware, resulting in irreparable
    faults that prevent the sensor from collecting data normally. According to the
    transmission process analysis, the complex agricultural environment, such as crops,
    terrain, and greenhouse walls, impacts wireless sensor communication. Due to a
    fault in the agricultural wireless sensor communication module, external attacks,
    and limited communication capabilities, data transmission fails, and sensor data
    collected cannot normally be sent to the server [64]. 3.1. Types of Sensor Faults
    The hard fault and soft fault types are distinguished by the duration of the sensor
    fault. Hard faults are permanent faults that persist until the fault recovery
    phase. Soft faults are temporary faults that disappear after a certain period.
    Figure 3 depicts the classification of hard faults and soft faults. Figure 3.
    Types of sensor faults in agricultural sensor systems. 3.1.1. Hard Fault A hard
    fault refers to the damage or failure of the agricultural sensor’s hardware, resulting
    in a sensor fault. A hard fault prevents the sensor from collecting and transmitting
    data normally, including a transmitter circuit fault, receiver circuit fault,
    microcontroller fault, sensor circuit fault, and power fault. A sensor with poor
    circuit contact is highly susceptible to short-circuit faults. Circuit disconnection
    results in an open circuit sensor fault. The poor working environment causes sensor
    hardware to malfunction. Most of these faults are permanent and require the replacement
    of defective hardware or maintenance circuits. Researchers report that power supply
    failures are the primary cause of sensor data errors [65]. The primary factor
    limiting wireless sensors is the power supply [66]. Wireless sensors must operate
    for years or even decades after deployment, particularly when some nodes are deployed
    in remote locations, making it difficult to regularly meet the power maintenance
    requirements. A power failure causes the sensor to be unable to collect information
    correctly, or transmit data normally, and may even cause the failure of the entire
    agricultural sensor network. The energy consumption of wireless sensors is primarily
    attributable to monitoring, data transmission, and data reception. In the paper
    [67], the impact of power faults on WSNs is categorized into four groups: node,
    link, routing path, and global fault. A node fault may occur when the power supply
    falls below the node’s operating level. When a node’s power supply is insufficient,
    its communication range is diminished, resulting in a link fault. When one or
    more nodes have link faults, the WSN becomes less efficient, resulting in routing
    path faults. When node or link faults occur in key nodes, WSN communication is
    interrupted, resulting in a global fault. 3.1.2. Soft Fault According to the fault
    scheme, sensor soft faults can be divided into drift faults, bias faults, accuracy
    decline faults, stuck faults, and spike faults [68,69]. (1) Drift fault A drift
    fault refers to the measured value and the real value of the sensor changing with
    time. At this time, the output value of the sensor increases at a constant rate.
    Such faults must be diagnosed and restored in time, otherwise, significant measurement
    errors occur [47]. In addition, drift faults cause severe damage to chemical sensors
    and biosensors if they are not readily detected at an early stage and need to
    be diagnosed early [70]. (2) Bias fault A bias fault (offset fault) refers to
    a constant value added to the sensor measurement value, and the sensor output
    result deviates from the normal value [71]. When the manipulator sensor has a
    bias fault, it leads to poor regulation or tracking performance and even affects
    the stability of the control system. In addition, faulty data may lead to wrong
    decisions, making unnecessary component replacement or task termination in the
    system [72]. (3) Stuck fault A stuck fault is a sudden sensor measurement error
    with a constant measurement value. This flaw may vanish over time, but it will
    persist for a considerable time. The fault characteristics are evident and simple
    to identify [25]. Sometimes, the causes of a stuck fault are identical to those
    of other faults. For instance, a clogged pressure sensor causes a stuck fault,
    while a blocked flow sensor causes a decline in accuracy [73]. (4) Accuracy decline
    fault An accuracy decline fault indicates that the average value of the sensor
    measurement does not change, but the variance of the output value increases, resulting
    in a decline in measurement accuracy [74]. This fault frequently occurs in sensors,
    and early detection is crucial for monitoring. However, current research focuses
    primarily on drift faults, bias faults, and stuck faults, while accuracy decline
    fault research is scarce [75]. (5) Spike fault A spike fault refers to a large
    amplitude spike in the measured value of the sensor, which often occurs in sensors.
    One of the reasons is the loose connection within the sensor node [76,77]. When
    a fault occurs in sensors, the system makes wrong decisions, such as spike faults
    in livestock and poultry houses that exceed the set environmental threshold, causing
    fans, heaters, and other equipment to be turned on or off. 3.2. Characteristics
    of Sensor Faults (1) High spatial-temporal correlation The data collected by the
    sensor are a time series consisting of an ordered collection of measurement values
    collected at regular time intervals. Consequently, the influence of historical
    and future data should be considered during fault diagnosis. Moreover, since a
    large number of sensors of the same type are typically deployed in a particular
    area, there is a high spatial correlation between sensors, so other sensors should
    be consulted during the fault diagnosis process. (2) Frequent abnormal data Fault
    data include bias fault, drift fault, and so on, mainly caused by sensor faults
    or damage. The difference between abnormal data and fault data is small, but the
    duration is usually short. Because agricultural sensors are typically deployed
    in outdoor harsh environments, sudden changes in the environment can result in
    random changes, measurement, and recording errors, and thus make sensors produce
    outliers. (3) Different fault duration Due to extreme weather fluctuations or
    the influence of other organisms, the sensor may experience a brief period of
    faults. When such an error occurs, the hardware and software of the sensor are
    normal, and the error is quickly rectified. Due to the deterioration of sensor
    hardware and software or insufficient power, fault duration is lengthy, and most
    faults are permanent. Such faults cannot recover independently; fault diagnosis
    and recovery are required. 4. Strategies for Sensor Fault Diagnosis Based on the
    different fault diagnosis methods performed in the Ag-IoT system structure, fault
    diagnosis is divided into centralized and distributed methods. 4.1. Centralized
    Strategy The most common solution in agricultural sensor fault diagnosis is a
    centralized approach. The central node or base station diagnoses each sensor node’s
    condition. The central node’s limitless resources (such as batteries and computing
    power) lengthen the lifespan of agricultural WSNs [78]. A trained fault diagnosis
    model is stored in the central node that periodically sends requests to the network
    to detect the state of the entire sensor network and diagnoses and locates faulty
    sensors after analyzing agricultural sensor data. Lau et al. [65] proposed a centralized
    fault detection method for WSNs based on the Naive Bayes framework to detect sensor
    battery issues; the diagnosis process was not performed in each sensor node, thereby
    reducing battery load. Salah et al. [79] proposed a centralized policy sensor
    fault scheme based on SVM that performed fault diagnosis at the cluster head and
    utilized fewer sensor resources. This method has minimal hardware requirements
    for agricultural sensor nodes, requires no additional computing and memory resources,
    and extends the sensor’s service life. However, a large amount of information
    is sent to the central node, which causes network congestion and slows down detection
    speed; due to fault diagnosis at the central node, it is difficult to meet real-time
    requirements; in the process of data transmission to the central node or base
    station via multiple hops, the pressure on the sink node increases, consuming
    the sink node’s resources. 4.2. Distributed Strategy Due to the small number of
    base stations in agricultural scenarios, weak signals, and low network coverage,
    agricultural sensor data cannot be transmitted to the central node or base station
    in some areas, making it challenging to implement centralized fault diagnosis.
    In addition, the centralized fault diagnosis strategy increases network traffic,
    resulting in network congestion and an inability to meet real-time fault diagnosis
    requirements. The distributed fault diagnosis strategy effectively resolves this
    issue. Distributed fault diagnosis is located between sensor nodes, eliminating
    the need to send agricultural sensor data to a central node or base station for
    diagnosis and satisfying real-time specifications. Sana et al. [80] proposed a
    distributed sensor fault diagnosis system based on a machine learning algorithm,
    which implemented fault detection in the sensor and performed the fault diagnosis
    on the central node, thereby ensuring the real-time performance of the fault diagnosis
    and reducing the number of calculations performed on the sensor. The greater the
    number of decisions the sensor node makes, the less information is transmitted
    to the central node, thereby accelerating the detection rate. However, the hardware
    requirements of the sensor node are high, and the node for fault diagnosis requires
    specific memory, computing, and battery resources. The memory resources of wireless
    sensor nodes are on the order of kilobytes, and the operation speed is on the
    order of MHz. Conversely, due to the limited resources carried by the sensor nodes,
    the fault diagnosis method must meet the requirements of being lightweight and
    having high performance, allowing for fast and accurate diagnosis despite limited
    computing and storage resources without excessive battery consumption. Data-driven
    fault detection methods require fewer resources than model-driven ones [81]. Some
    researchers [82] investigated using lightweight fault diagnosis algorithms to
    reduce sensor resource consumption during the fault diagnosis procedure. 5. Intelligent
    Fault Diagnosis of Sensor Faults The purpose of sensor fault diagnosis is to detect
    the fault data in the sensor, and restore or isolate the faulty sensor so that
    the sensor can finally provide normal data to the user. Traditional fault diagnosis
    techniques mainly rely on manual judgment, and the experience and expertise of
    engineers determine the accuracy of judgment. However, with advances in science
    and technology, agriculture has entered the 4.0 era, and the data collected by
    sensors are multi-dimensional and large-scale, and the monitoring objects often
    have coupling relationships and affect each other. Relying only on manual machine
    fault diagnosis struggles to meet the current needs in terms of accuracy and real-time.
    In factory farming scenarios, users want an automated way to reduce labor costs
    and improve diagnostic accuracy. The introduction of intelligent fault diagnosis
    (IFD) technology is expected to achieve this goal. IFD refers to the application
    of machine learning theories (such as artificial neural networks (ANN), support
    vector machines (SVMs), and deep neural networks (DNNs)) in machine fault diagnosis
    [83], adaptively learning machine fault diagnosis knowledge from the collected
    data, automatically establishing a relationship model between the collected data
    and the health state of the machine, and realizing the automation and intelligence
    of sensor fault diagnosis technology. This section divides the sensor fault diagnosis
    technology into three methods: model-based, artificial intelligence-based, and
    deep learning diagnosis-based, as shown in Figure 4. Relevant sensor fault diagnosis
    approaches are shown in Table 3. Figure 4. Classification of intelligent fault
    diagnosis methods. 5.1. Model-Based Fault Diagnosis Methods The model-based fault
    diagnosis method was proposed by Beard of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
    in 1971 [16] and refers to using knowledge of the system’s structure, behavior,
    and function to diagnose the fault of the system [84]. Based on the model, fault
    diagnosis methods are divided into three types: state estimation, equivalent space,
    and parameter estimation [85]. The approach consists of two main steps: residual
    error generation and residual error evaluation. This diagnosis method requires
    understanding the mechanism of the research object and establishing a mathematical
    model, using the system’s structure, behavior, or function to simulate the model,
    and then making a decision based on the difference between the actual measured
    signal and the model measured signal. By generating residual signals to achieve
    fault diagnosis [86], the occurrence of a fault can be detected by evaluating
    whether the resulting residual exceeds a threshold. Vasso et al. [87] designed
    a model-based distributed fault diagnosis framework for detecting and isolating
    multi-sensor faults in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. The
    adaptive threshold framework ensures the proposed method’s robustness against
    modeling uncertainties and measurement noise. Zhang et al. [88] proved that a
    Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based sensor fault detection method is less
    efficient in fault detection under minor deviation fault conditions. Yu et al.
    [89] proposed a model-based fault diagnosis scheme that uses open-circuit voltage
    residuals and capacity residuals to deduce fault values of voltage and current
    sensors for battery fault diagnosis. Yan et al. [90] proposed a Cp_PLV model combining
    an unsupervised learning method with change point recognition. Experiments show
    that the predictive effect of the model is good and can fault diagnose the sensor
    in complex working environments. Due to the fact that the model-based fault diagnosis
    method employs fundamental knowledge for fault diagnosis, it has improved fault
    interpretability. It can also meet the real-time requirements of agricultural
    sensor fault diagnosis. In practice, however, the model is uncertain, and it is
    difficult to establish a model that corresponds to other agricultural sensors.
    It is challenging to ensure fault diagnosis accuracy with an unmatched model,
    which cannot detect the fault value and is not universal. 5.2. Artificial Intelligence-Based
    Fault Diagnosis Methods With the widespread adoption of Ag-IoT, the uncertainty
    and complexity of the sensor system have gradually grown, as has the difficulty
    of developing an accurate mathematical model. The artificial intelligence-based
    fault diagnosis method treats the system as a black box, does not need to understand
    the structure and principle of the system and the precise mathematical model of
    the diagnostic object, and uses a large amount of sensor system data for fault
    diagnosis [91]. The method relies primarily on real-time or historical data and
    comprises artificial intelligence algorithms and statistical data processing.
    The primary benefit of this method is that it does not require a precise system
    model, and it has been utilized successfully for agricultural sensor fault diagnosis.
    Common fault detection techniques based on artificial intelligence include statistical
    analysis, expert systems, and machine learning. 5.2.1. Statistical Analysis Methods
    The statistical analysis method primarily involves a sensor’s randomly distributed
    data collection. The sensor is deemed defective when the probability of the data
    instance generated by the model is extremely low. The primary components of this
    method are time series analysis and multivariate statistical analysis. The time
    series analysis method examines the characteristics of sensor data from a time
    series perspective, estimates the predicted value of the sensor data, and determines
    whether the sensor is faulty by comparing the difference between the predicted
    value and the actual value. Hao et al. [92] designed a module based on time series
    theory to detect sensor faults in the navigation system of autonomous mobile agricultural
    robots. Simple and effective, the time series method was able to explain the relevant
    results intuitively. However, agricultural sensors are typically deployed outside,
    where the environment constantly changes, causing the sensor data to fluctuate
    greatly and be prone to error. Due to the difficulty of a single sensor explaining
    the complexity of agricultural environments, multivariate statistical analysis
    methods that combine data from multiple sensors for fault diagnosis are crucial.
    Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) [14], Partial Least Squares Regression
    (PLS) [93], and PCA [94] are the three multivariate statistical analysis methods.
    After establishing the probability statistics model, the model can effectively
    detect sensor system faults. The model is highly interpretable; however, when
    using time correlation to detect faulty data, a sudden change in the data distribution
    will reduce the time correlation and make sensor fault diagnosis more difficult.
    The statistical analysis method has the following drawbacks: the nonparametric
    statistical model struggles to meet real-time requirements; the parametric statistical
    model is ineffective in practical applications due to a lack of data distribution
    knowledge in the sensor system; the histogram does not take into account the relationship
    between multivariate data and only applies to univariate data. 5.2.2. Expert System
    Methods The method based on an expert system is used to diagnose faults based
    on the experience of experts and maintenance personnel involved in producing agricultural
    sensors. It is primarily divided into rule-based expert systems and expert systems
    with fuzzy reasoning. An expert system is a structured knowledge system that imitates
    human experts to solve problems in a particular domain. Expert system components
    include a knowledge base, a rule base, an inference engine, a human-computer interface,
    and an explanation facility [95]. The knowledge base is the key to ensuring the
    expert system’s accuracy, which comprises the operators’ theoretical and professional
    knowledge. The system operates as follows: the data to be diagnosed is input through
    a human-computer interface, the inference engine matches the current known conditions,
    information, and rules of the knowledge base, and the user is then presented with
    the conclusion of the matching rules [96,97]. Prasenjit [98] proposed a WSN fault
    node classification and management scheme based on fuzzy rules, which detected
    the sensor fault state and divided it into various categories to guarantee the
    reusability of fault nodes. Pooja et al. [99] proposed a hardware fault diagnosis
    model for sensor nodes based on a fuzzy inference system with three inputs, developed
    27 fuzzy rules based on the status of the transmitter, receiver, and battery,
    and categorized the nodes as normal nodes, end nodes, and dead nodes. This scheme’s
    detection accuracy and misdiagnosis rate have been enhanced. A mathematical model
    is not required by the expert system-based technique for determining what is wrong.
    It employs the rules and information we already possess to determine what is wrong
    with an agricultural sensor system. It has outstanding advantages in the application
    of nonlinear systems because it has good performance and strong learning ability
    in dealing with known faults. Nevertheless, there are still things that could
    be improved with this method: As more and more types of sensors are utilized,
    the complexity of the sensor system must increase. This makes it difficult to
    determine why the sensors are malfunctioning. The current expert systems for fault
    diagnosis lack universality and adaptability, and each system operates independently.
    This is extremely wasteful. Users are interested in the location and timing of
    agricultural sensor failures. 5.2.3. Machine Learning Methods There is no simple
    correspondence between fault types and fault characteristics due to the complexity
    and unpredictability of sensor systems. The fault diagnosis method based on machine
    learning can train support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (NN),
    and other machine learning algorithms using normal data and fault data, and then
    diagnose the fault of sensors. SVM is a machine learning algorithm that solves
    binary classification problems [100]; sensor fault diagnosis is based on small
    samples. Consequently, the SVM model is ideally suited for sensor fault diagnosis
    and has been widely implemented in the field [101,102]. Yang et al. [103] divided
    multiple fault combinations according to the correlation of faults. They developed
    multiple SVM models based on these fault combinations to combat the misdiagnosis
    caused by insufficient and unreliable training data in traditional SVM models.
    Each SVM model assigned positive and negative labels to fault samples, corrected
    various label combinations using DS theory, and then determined the fault type.
    Although the fault identification accuracy of this scheme has been enhanced, the
    DS-theory-based correction rate must be improved. Deng et al. [104] proposed OS-LSSVM
    for sensor fault detection, which solved the problem of LS-SVM lacking sparsity,
    enabled online fault diagnosis, and increased calculation speed. The SVM method
    primarily solves the quadratic programming problem; however, the calculation method
    based on quadratic programming restricts real-time performance and is unsuitable
    for online fault diagnosis. Han et al. [105] proposed an LS-SVM model that reduced
    the computational complexity by transforming the quadratic programming problem
    into a linear equation. The model’s execution time was reduced by 36.7% compared
    to the SVM model, and the diagnostic accuracy was also enhanced. In addition,
    Liu et al. [106] proposed a KNN-FSVM fault diagnosis scheme, which trained SVM
    by only selecting boundary data, thereby reducing the need for computing and storage
    resources. This was a solution to the problem that the computing time of SVM increases
    exponentially with the amount of data, as do the requirements for computing and
    storage resources. While traditional SVM models can diagnose systems with a small
    number of data samples, as sensor performance becomes more complex, the types
    of sensor faults increase, and the accuracy of the classification model decreases.
    Therefore, the SVM-based fault diagnosis method is not suitable for use alone
    in the current diversified agricultural production mode. ANN is a mathematical
    model that simulates the mechanism by which the nervous system of the human brain
    processes complex information based on the fundamental principles of neural networks
    in biology [107]. ANN is a nonlinear model primarily composed of neurons that
    are incorporated into three layers, referred to as the input layer, hidden layer,
    and output layer, with the ability to simulate any continuous nonlinear function
    and learn from samples, expressing the learned fault diagnosis knowledge with
    neural network connection weights, which has been utilized in the fault diagnosis
    of complex systems [108,109]. Back-propagation Neural Network (BPNN) [110] is
    currently the most widely used neural network model. Researchers created it to
    address the challenges of multi-layer neural networks. Hu et al. [111] employed
    BPNN for temperature sensor fault diagnosis. The model selected the most recent
    local data, reducing the computation required and enabling online detection. In
    order to eliminate data noise and improve the accuracy of neural network fault
    diagnosis, Shi et al. [112] incorporated wavelet denoising technology into the
    BPNN, which enhanced the BPNN’s fault detection rate. Guo et al. [113] proposed
    an EFMSAE-LSTM method for predicting the time series of mechanical failures, which
    can accurately predict the failure time series of most key mechanical components.
    Mariam et al. [114] performed fault diagnosis for HVAC sensors using a self-associative
    neural network and compared this technique to principal component analysis. Not
    only was the diagnostic accuracy of this method significantly enhanced, but it
    could also diagnose multiple sensors simultaneously. Precision agriculture is
    characterized by massive normal agricultural data and small sample fault data.
    The extreme imbalance of these data renders the neural network’s fault diagnosis
    method less stable; The parameters of the model need to be adjusted repeatedly
    to meet the requirements of the practical application, which requires good model
    training experience. Although machine learning-based fault diagnosis methods have
    high time and money costs in network training, they also require relatively large
    training data samples. However, considering the practical application of sensors
    in agriculture, the data collected is susceptible to many factors, such as weather,
    region, season, and changes in the growth stage of animals and plants. Especially
    for the current large-scale and industrialized farming pattern, it is difficult
    or even impossible to obtain accurate system models. Small changes in the system
    can lead to poor failure detection response. Therefore, compared with the fault
    diagnosis methods based on models and expert systems, the fault diagnosis methods
    based on machine learning have good generalization ability and wider applicability,
    which are suitable for application in the era of diversified and integrated agriculture
    4.0. 5.3. Deep-Learning-Based Fault Diagnosis Method With the advancement of hardware
    and algorithms and the exponential growth of data, fault diagnosis has shifted
    from machine learning to deep learning [115]. Deep learning, a subfield of artificial
    intelligence, is the newest data analysis and image processing technology. Compared
    with traditional statistical learning models, deep learning models have a stronger
    ability to extract underlying information from data. The structure of deep learning
    models is usually formed by multi-layer neural networks, which can be flexibly
    changed to meet different practical needs. In addition, multiple layers of data
    processing units are assembled to form a deep architecture. It has powerful learning
    capabilities and can extract features automatically from input data. Hierarchical
    features are represented by low-level features, which can efficiently and quickly
    solve complex problems and have good portability, making them suitable for sensor
    fault diagnosis. Autoencoders (AEs), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs), Recurrent Neural
    Networks (RNNs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the current deep
    learning models for sensor fault diagnosis. 5.3.1. Autoencoder (AE) An AE is an
    unsupervised learning neural network that uses the back-propagation algorithm
    to make the output value equal to the input value [116], which can effectively
    extract low-dimensional data features. Encoding and decoding are the two components
    of an AE. The encoder compresses the input into a representation of latent space,
    and the decoder reconstructs the information from the latent space representation.
    With the advent of deep learning, researchers have created additional AE model
    types. For instance, to extract abstract features from data, several AEs are stacked
    to form a Stacked Autoencoder (SAE), and a Denoising Autoencoder (DAE) was developed
    to improve the anti-noise capability of neural networks [117]. Under the premise
    of training on small data samples, AE can achieve efficient fault diagnosis when
    combined with other classification methods [118]. The use of AE for fault diagnosis
    has received considerable attention in recent years. Luo et al. [119] designed
    an AE-distributed fault diagnosis system with only three layers of the network,
    which was used for fault diagnosis in sensors, and the model was trained in the
    cloud to address the issue that deep learning methods consume a great deal of
    computing and communication resources. Jia et al. [120] proposed a normalized
    sparse AE model for intelligent fault diagnosis, learning various meaningful features
    from the input signal. The translation in-variant features were obtained in the
    feature layer, and then the fault was identified in the output layer, and the
    accuracy rate of the model test reached 99.92 percent. In addition, due to the
    model training phase, AE automatically extracts non-fault-related features, which
    hinders fault diagnosis performance. Wang et al. [121] proposed a supervised SAE
    model capable of extracting fault-related deep features and configuring fine-tuned
    network initial parameters. This method improved classification precision with
    fewer iterations. The local minimum problem exists in the traditional AE method
    for fault diagnosis. Through batch regression, hyperparameter optimization, and
    other techniques, the model can be made to closely resemble the actual working
    conditions of the sensor, which is advantageous for resolving this issue. Mallak
    et al. [122] propose a two-stage fault diagnosis method that uses an LSTM autoencoder
    to perform a separate fault detection stage in advance. This method can effectively
    catch rare faults. AE has the advantages of strong learning ability, simple structure,
    and easy training. However, traditional AE only uses a single-layer encoder for
    feature extraction, which struggles to extract deep features and has limited data
    processing capabilities. As the modern agricultural production process gradually
    presents the characteristics of modularization and specialization, it is suitable
    for application in distributed fault diagnosis and processing small samples of
    univariate data. 5.3.2. Deep Belief Network (DBN) A DBN is a probabilistic generative
    model of multiple Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM). Each RBM consists of only
    two layers of neurons, the visible layer and the hidden layer, which are connected
    by a symmetrical weighted connection matrix [123,124]. The visible layer inputs
    training data, whereas the hidden layer extracts features. In each RBM, the data
    vector is used to infer the hidden layer, which is then used as the data vector
    for the subsequent layer to improve the probability variation lower bound of the
    training data. As feature extraction is a crucial step in the diagnosis process,
    DBN employs an unsupervised greedy layer-by-layer method to obtain high-level
    feature representation, which can effectively eliminate the complexity and uncertainty
    introduced by manual feature extraction and enhance the intelligence of fault
    diagnosis [125,126]. In addition, DBN has the capacity to manage high-dimensional
    and nonlinear data, thereby resolving the issues of data dimensional disaster
    and inadequate diagnostic capability. Since methods like SVM and ANN can only
    detect faulty data but not faulty sensors [127], Mandal et al. [128] proposed
    a method based on DBN and the generalized likelihood ratio test. DBN was utilized
    to classify fault data and normal data, the faulty sensor was identified by the
    maximum deviation between the fault data and the average value of the normal data,
    and the quantity of fault data and the generalized likelihood ratio test determined
    the fault mode. However, this method only detected faults when the signal exceeded
    the threshold; therefore, other methods are required to detect faults when the
    signal was below the threshold. Due to the loss of potentially valuable information
    in the original data caused by the layer-by-layer feature compression of the DBN
    model, Wang et al. [129] employed the strategy of repeatedly stacking the original
    data during the training phase in order to fully extract the valuable information
    by extending the DBN model. Each RBM was trained with the original data so that
    the extracted features were highly correlated with the original data, and potentially
    valuable information was preserved. Compared to the conventional DBN model, the
    accuracy rate has been enhanced. DBNs can extract advanced features from large
    amounts of data and directly use raw signals to build end-to-end intelligent diagnostic
    models to reduce reliance on expert experience and known knowledge. They can fuse
    the time domain and frequency domain characteristics of each sensor signal and
    apply this to DBN training, which can not only realize fault diagnosis but also
    diagnose fault types. They are suitable for applications in advanced composite
    sensor systems. 5.3.3. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) An RNN is a type of neural
    network that processes sequence data. Its most distinguishing characteristic is
    that the output of neurons is transmitted to the input of itself or other neurons.
    Its properties can connect the nodes between hidden layers, and the input of the
    hidden layer incorporates the input of the input layer and the output of the hidden
    layer at the time of its creation. This concatenated neural network structure
    is appropriate for time series data and can preserve data dependencies [130].
    Later, Hochreiter et al. [131] proposed a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to improve
    the traditional RNN model to address the issue that RNNs are not good at long-term
    memory. Table 3. Development and application of intelligent sensor fault diagnosis
    approach.                              Due to the fact that sensor data are collected
    at various time points with a high temporal correlation, the RNN model has been
    extensively studied in sensor fault diagnosis. Azzam et al. [132] utilized RNN
    to model sensor nodes, node dynamics, and sensor node coupling to achieve sensor
    node fault diagnosis. This method had a lower early false alarm rate than the
    Kalman filter. Lei et al. [133] adopted LSTM for wind turbine sensor fault diagnosis.
    The method can be extended to multi-sensor fault diagnosis through data fusion.
    In addition, the method was robust under limited data conditions, and its performance
    was superior to SVM and other approaches. Long et al. [134] proposed an RNN-based
    satellite sensor fault diagnosis scheme. They combined the linear parameter change
    method with the based model method to improve the robustness of fault diagnosis
    and the accuracy of the scheme. To solve the overfitting problem of deep neural
    networks in fault diagnosis, Xia et al. [135] implemented dropout in the LSTM
    model to prevent overfitting and enhance the training process’s efficacy. Since
    deep learning automatically extracts features from the original data, there is
    no mapping between the extracted features and the fault mechanism. Although the
    deep learning model is suitable for resolving the big data characteristics of
    large-scale sensors, its training speed is slow and consumes computing resources.
    Therefore, the deep learning model is not typically executed directly on sensors
    but on edge nodes or the cloud. 5.3.4. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) CNNs
    are a significant subfield of deep learning. A CNN has an input layer, a convolution
    layer, a pooling layer, a full connection layer, and an output layer. It is capable
    of auto-extracting features and is both robust and generalizable. CNN is currently
    used primarily for feature extraction of two-dimensional and three-dimensional
    image sequences [136]. Still, because CNN has the characteristics of lattice and
    convolution operations and is suitable for multisensor data processing, some researchers
    have introduced CNN to the field of fault diagnosis [137]. Debasish et al. [138]
    proposed a CNN fault diagnosis method to diagnose multisensor faults at the same
    calculation cost to reduce model training time and cost. Sun et al. [139] proposed
    a CNN-RF sensor fault diagnosis method, which converted the original sensor signal
    into a grey matrix image, and the CNN is used to automatically extract the features
    of the gray matrix image, reducing the loss of effective information and improving
    the accuracy Muneer et al. [140,141] proposed an attention-based deep convolutional
    neural network (DCNN) architecture to predict the RUL of turbofan engines. They
    used multivariate time information to extract features, which significantly improved
    the prediction performance of the model. Zhang et al. [142] replaced the conventionally
    used fully connected layers in traditional CNN with a multilayer pool classifier,
    thereby reducing the number of network parameters and the risk of overfitting.
    The method performed a fault diagnosis on the acceleration sensor, with high fault-diagnosis
    accuracy and low computing resource consumption. CNN’s ability to process two-dimensional
    and three-dimensional image data is its primary benefit. Muneer et al. [141] proposed
    a data-driven predictive model based on deep neural networks (DNNs), using sliding
    time window technology to prepare data, which does not require prior knowledge
    of prediction or signal processing. Currently, research in fault diagnosis focuses
    primarily on machinery, particularly rotating machinery, while research on sensor
    fault diagnosis is limited. Some researchers attempt to convert one-dimensional
    sensor data into a two-dimensional form, but this may destroy the spatial correlation
    of the original data and result in the loss of some error-related data. CNN is
    also suitable for processing large sample sizes but has a problem with overfitting
    small sample fault data. The aforementioned methods for fault diagnosis are highly
    accurate, but each has advantages and disadvantages. The model-based method for
    fault diagnosis is highly interpretable. It does not require a large amount of
    data, but the model is complex and highly professional, which is unsuitable for
    daily agricultural applications. The fault diagnosis method based on artificial
    intelligence does not require an accurate mathematical model, and the accuracy
    of the diagnosis is high. However, the model has high requirements for calculation,
    storage, and other resources and requires a large amount of historical data. However,
    In daily agricultural activities, many quantity monitoring systems tend to collect
    and store real-time data, and insufficient amounts of historical data may reduce
    the accuracy of the model. The fault diagnosis method based on deep learning overcomes
    the flaw of the manual feature extraction method based on machine learning, and
    the model accuracy is higher; however, the method for fault diagnosis based on
    deep learning has flaws. To ensure the accuracy of the fault diagnosis model,
    it must be debugged and simulated multiple times, which wastes a significant amount
    of human resources and requires more resources such as computation and storage.
    Table 4 displays the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Table 4. Comparison
    of advantages and disadvantages of intelligent fault diagnosis methods. 5.4. Edge
    Computing-Based Fault Diagnosis Method Edge computing is a new computing model
    that deploys computing and storage resources (such as Cloudlets, and fog nodes)
    to networks closer to mobile devices or sensors. IoT-based edge computing falls
    into three main categories: local devices adapted to specific definitions and
    good targets, local data centers providing significant data processing and storage
    capacity, and regional data centers closer to the data source. In response to
    the limitations of agricultural land, edge computing can be applied to work over
    long distances, and the processing of data generated by sensors through edge computing
    can improve response times, reduce the amount of communication transmitted to
    the cloud, and avoid latency problems in data processing [143]. Control monitoring
    of data using edge computing allows data consistency and integrity analysis, identification,
    and removal of erroneous data. When an edge device fails, the edge computing system
    can notify the user which component is at fault, which facilitates sensor fault
    detection. Sun et al. proposed a real-time detection algorithm based on edge computing
    and cloud computing to improve the average repair time by pre-processing the original
    video data when performing fault diagnosis on video surveillance systems [144].
    Li et al. point out that sensor-based data collection systems suffer from significant
    latency and data redundancy, and edge computing is often applied closer to the
    source of data generation, i.e., data processing is performed locally, sharing
    the reduced data redundancy and solving latency problems [145]. Since edge computing
    will control in real-time, monitor the process of data processing, and send the
    analysis results to the cloud, it is convenient for managers to view the working
    status of sensors in time and make judgments on whether the sensors produce faults.
    To solve some of the problems of wireless sensor data collection, wireless sensors
    are combined with edge computing to establish data collection algorithms. In wireless
    sensor networks, through edge servers, invalid data is filtered, sensing parameters
    are obtained, and the collected data is transmitted to the cloud or edge servers
    to improve sensor networks’ intelligence and computing capability [146], laying
    the foundation for its fault diagnosis. Akhtar et al. proposed that the data distribution
    of edge computing was heterogeneous and required distributed data processing and
    storage. On the basis of edge computing, they proposed High-Performance Computing
    (HPC), which can identify data anomalies by performing quality checks at the edge
    layer, which can help troubleshoot sensors to ensure accuracy and effectiveness.
    Users can view, analyze, and operate the data stored in the cloud and use the
    machine learning tools stored in the cloud database to analyze the data and make
    judgments when the sensor is faulty [147]. 6. Challenges and Future Development
    Smart agriculture with Agriculture 4.0 at its core has become the current focus
    of agricultural development on a global scale. With the development of IoT, big
    data, wireless sensing, and other technologies, intelligent equipment in agriculture
    continue to increase, the types of faults are becoming more complex and diverse,
    and the demand for Ag-IoT-based fault diagnosis technology is rising. Some fault
    detection methods based on a single target can no longer meet the demand. First,
    it is necessary to consider the economic benefits and feasibility of the diagnostic
    system for farmers and try to ensure the system’s simplicity while ensuring that
    the diagnosis is correct. At the same time, the amount of information in the agricultural
    field is huge, which is a great test for the stability of any system. The main
    goal of future fault diagnosis technology is to achieve early detection and treatment
    of sensor faults while ensuring system stability. Therefore, we provide a summary
    of the fault diagnosis areas that will receive future attention. 6.1. Edge Computing
    Intelligent fault diagnosis requires high real-time performance and hardware resources.
    Practical issues such as network unavailability, full bandwidth, or insufficient
    sensor computing and storage resources are frequently encountered in agricultural
    scenarios, making it difficult for centralized and distributed fault diagnosis
    strategies to meet sensor fault diagnosis requirements. Edge computing is a remedy
    for the aforementioned issues. Edge computing allows faster response times and
    more secure data transmission and processing than other sensor fault diagnosis
    methods. At the same time, edge computing can be combined with deep learning algorithms
    to reduce model training time and make sensor fault diagnosis more efficient [148].
    Edge computing transfers a portion of the central server’s computing and storage
    resources to edge nodes and collects sensor data on the edge computing platform
    to develop fault diagnosis models. Unmanned plant protection machines and inspection
    robots are two examples of agricultural equipment that transports substantial
    resources. Consequently, using such equipment as a platform for edge computing
    does not increase costs and satisfies the requirements for fault diagnosis. 6.2.
    Satellite Communication Few base stations and low network coverage are characteristics
    of Ag-IoT, which prevents the wireless sensor node from sending data to the central
    node, using the centralized fault diagnosis strategy, and sending fault information
    to the central node using the distributed fault diagnosis strategy. In addition,
    agricultural sensors are frequently deployed in harsh environments, and environmental
    factors such as sudden changes can cause network disruptions and other problems.
    With the proposal of Starlink, people began to investigate the commercial application
    of satellite Internet and the use of satellite communication to solve the problem
    of no network in sensor deployment areas [149]. Satellite communication has the
    advantages of long communication distance, being unrestricted by natural conditions,
    and having high stability, which guarantees the network’s continuous availability
    in sensor fault diagnosis. 6.3. Hybrid Fault Diagnosis Model The sensor system
    in Ag-IoT is frequently dynamic, uncertain, open, vulnerable to attack, and concurrently
    susceptible to multiple faults. If only a single fault diagnosis method is used,
    issues such as low accuracy, poor generalization ability, and incomplete diagnosis
    arise, making it difficult to achieve accurate diagnosis results. The method for
    fault diagnosis based on the fusion of multiple technologies can be studied. Combining
    a model-based approach and deep learning can enhance a diagnostic system’s robustness,
    accuracy, and dependability while decreasing uncertainty. This method can not
    only expand the fault ability based on deep learning but also fully utilize the
    interpretability advantage of the model-based method, which aids technicians in
    understanding the fault type and origin. 7. Conclusions This paper reviews fault
    diagnosis technology in the context of artificial intelligence technology and
    big data. The concept of sensors and sensor networks in Ag-IoT are introduced,
    and common sensor fault types and fault diagnosis strategies in Ag-IoT are listed.
    In addition, the research and application status of three sensor fault diagnosis
    technologies are summarized: model-based, artificial intelligence-based, and deep
    learning-based. The methods are compared and their advantages and disadvantages
    are discussed. Through the analysis of this review, the following conclusions
    are drawn, and suggestions for future work are put forward. (1) Presently, sensors
    are usually deployed in harsh environments, which are extremely vulnerable to
    environmental impact, resulting in inaccurate data collection and irreversible
    impact on sensors. In the future, sensors will be further developed, less affected
    by the environment, and can use limited resources to work for a long time; The
    output format codes between different sensors have developed from the original
    disunity to the standardized format. (2) Deep learning has unique advantages,
    although the research in the field of sensor fault diagnosis is still in its infancy,
    it has a good development prospect. It is necessary to improve the system’s robustness
    to meet the changes in the conditions in practical applications. (3) The commonly
    used single-fault diagnosis methods often encounter many problems: resource limitation
    problems, data transmission problems, node optimization problems, data security
    problems, and so on. In the future, fault diagnosis methods based on the integration
    of multiple technologies can be studied, such as adding edge computing and satellite
    communication and combining expert systems and deep learning to shorten the training
    time by using known rules through transfer learning, which could improve the accuracy
    of sensor fault diagnosis and reduce the frequency of faults to ensure the stability
    and reliability of intelligent agricultural measurement and control systems. Author

    Abstract Parallel deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) algorithms have been

    medical data processing technology based on distributed parallel machine learning
    algorithm Article 07 October 2021 1 Introduction DCNN is one of the important
    classification models of deep learning (DL), which has been verified to exhibit
    superior advantages at extracting high-dimensional data features. Therefore, it
    is widely used in smart healthcare [1, 2], target detection [3], image classification
    [4], image segmentation [5], fault diagnosis [6], and computer vision [7]. However,
    with the rise of big data and the increased complexity of tasks, the efficiency
    of DCNN is severely impacted, resulting in longer training times and high computational
    cost especially in large-scale datasets. Therefore, seeking an efficient way of
    data processing has become the focus of academic research. Google’s MapReduce
    is a kind of parallel computing framework with remarkable advantages in computing
    resource scheduling and the rapid processing of big data [8,9,10]. Meanwhile,
    it is built on top of the distributed data store and supports parallelizing data
    processing on large clusters. Therefore, when the DCNN model is distributed among
    the MapReduce nodes for parallel training, it will have higher training efficiency
    than the single-machine training method [11,12,13,14]. Based on the above analysis,
    many parallel CNN algorithms have been proposed. Wang et al. [15] proposed a sparse
    autocombination spatio-temporal convolutional neural network (SASTCNN) based on
    MapReduce. A parallel matrix multiplication algorithm was designed and implemented
    in the SASTCNN. The feasibility, stability and correctness of the algorithm were
    verified by comparing with the traditional serial algorithm. Similarly, Venkatesan
    et al. [16] proposed a non-Gaussian convolutional neural network algorithm (NG-CNN)
    for CT image detection of lung nodules to improve the accuracy of detecting lung
    nodules. The method eliminated Gaussian noise in CT scan image and performed image
    classification in a parallel framework. The classification accuracy, specificity,
    sensitivity, precision, and recall were analyzed to demonstrate that the algorithm
    can reduce the training time without affecting the accuracy. To further improve
    the training efficiency, Nahiduzzaman et al. [17] proposed a computer-aided lung
    disease recognition method based on chest X-ray (CXR) images. The method combined
    the robust feature extraction capability of a lightweight parallel convolutional
    neural network with the classification capability of the Extreme Learning Machine
    algorithm CNN-ELM, which can effectively recognize 17 different forms of lung
    diseases. Experimental results show that the classification accuracy of the method
    is high and outperforms the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) model. Nankani et
    al. [18] designed a method for the parallel convolutional neural network with
    global average pooling (PCNN-GAP) for ECG classification. The method performed
    noise removal as well as equal-size segmentation of the ECG, and extracted the
    various feature coefficients of the image using Pan Tompkins detector. The feasibility
    and efficiency of the method can be seen by the performance of training the model
    in a parallel framework. Although the algorithms mentioned above have achieved
    better training results, they still have a lot of defects that hinder the speed
    and accuracy of data processing: (1) the excessive redundant features in the batch
    training reduce the computing speed and occupy a large amount of storage space;
    (2) the training of massive data leads to the insufficient performance of convolution
    operation in the stage of parameter updating; (3) the distributed nodes are easy
    to wait for each other because of the deviation of computing power, which leads
    to the low efficiency of parallel merging in the parameter combination stage.
    Based on the above defects, this paper proposes a parallel DCNN algorithm based
    on MapReduce and Winograd convolution (PDCNN-MRW) to speed up the depth convolution
    operation. The experimental results show that this algorithm has high parallel
    computing efficiency when dealing with large amounts of data. The main contributions
    of this research are as follows: 1. A strategy called FS-CSNMI (feature filtering
    strategy based on cosine similarity and normalized mutual information) is proposed
    to solve the problem of redundant features in batch training. In this strategy,
    the representative features are filtered from the input feature maps at first,
    and then those representative features are fused with the redundant features to
    construct the new feature maps. 2. A strategy called PWC-MR (parallel Winograd
    convolution method based on MapReduce) is presented to enhance the performance
    of convolution computation in big data environment. This strategy improves the
    performance of convolution by using parallel Winograd convolution to train the
    DCNN model. Moreover, the function ESS(X) and EDS(X) are presented to meet the
    need for parallelization, which further optimizes the performance of parallel
    Winograd convolution. 3. A strategy called LB-MTTM (load balancing strategy based
    on multiway tree and task migration) is developed to improve the efficiency of
    parameter parallel merging for DCNN. This strategy reduces the response time of
    each node by balancing the load between the nodes in the parallel framework. The
    rest of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the definition
    of cosine similarity, normalized mutual information, and Winograd convolution.
    Section 3 introduces the details of the PDCNN-MRW algorithm. Section 4 presents
    and discusses the experimental results, including running time, accuracy, and
    speed-up ratio. Section 5 concludes the paper. 2 Preliminary 2.1 Cosine similarity
    Cosine similarity [19] is a method to measure the similarity between two vectors
    by calculating the cosine value of the angle between them. The higher the value,
    the more similar the two vectors are. Given two images X and Y, the cosine similarity
    between them is expressed as follow. $$\\begin{aligned} \\cos (\\theta ) = \\frac{{{\\textbf{X}}*{\\textbf{Y}}}}{{\\left\\|
    {\\textbf{X}} \\right\\| \\times \\left\\| {\\textbf{Y}} \\right\\| }} = \\frac{{\\sum
    \\nolimits _{i = 1}^n {{x_i} \\times {y_i}} }}{{\\sqrt{\\sum \\nolimits _{i =
    1}^n {{x_i}^2} } \\times \\sqrt{\\sum \\nolimits _{i = 1}^n {{y_i}^2} } }} \\end{aligned}$$
    (1) where X and Y represent the vector representations of images X and Y. For
    the convenience of expression, (1) is modified to (2). $$\\begin{aligned} SIM(X,Y)
    = 1 - \\cos (\\theta ) = 1 - \\frac{{\\sum \\nolimits _{i = 1}^n {{x_i} \\times
    {y_i}} }}{{\\sqrt{\\sum \\nolimits _{i = 1}^n {{x_i}^2} } \\times \\sqrt{\\sum
    \\nolimits _{i = 1}^n {{y_i}^2} } }} \\end{aligned}$$ (2) 2.2 Normalized mutual
    information Normalized mutual information [20] is used to measure the similarity
    between two images. The larger the value of normalized mutual information is,
    the more similar they are. It can be used as a criterion or an objective function
    in image recognition. For a given pair of images M and N, the normalized mutual
    information between them is expressed as below. $$\\begin{aligned} NMI(M,N) =
    \\frac{{H(M) + H(N)}}{{H(M,N)}} \\end{aligned}$$ (3) where H(M) and H(N) are the
    information entropy of the image M and image N, respectively. H(M,N) is the joint
    entropy of two images. 2.3 Winograd convolution algorithm Winograd convolution
    algorithm [21] is a kind of minimum filtering algorithm that can reduce the times
    of multiplication by a series of transformations on the input feature map and
    network weight. When the input is \\(d = {[{d_0}{d_1}{d_2}{d_3}]^T}\\)and the
    convolution kernel is \\(g = {[{g_0}{{\\textrm{g}}_1}{{\\textrm{g}}_2}]^T}\\),
    the convolution operation is expressed as (4). $$\\begin{aligned} F(2,3) = \\left[
    \\begin{array}{l} {d_0}{d_1}{d_2}\\\\ {d_1}{d_2}{d_3} \\end{array} \\right] \\left[
    \\begin{array}{l} {g_0}\\\\ {g_1}\\\\ {g_2} \\end{array} \\right] = \\left[ \\begin{array}{l}
    {m_1} + {m_2} + {m_3}\\\\ {m_2} - {m_3} - {m_4} \\end{array} \\right] \\end{aligned}$$
    (4) where \\({m_1} = ({d_0} - {d_2}){g_0}\\), \\({m_2} = ({d_1} + {d_2}) \\times
    ({g_0} + {g_1} + {g_2})/2\\), \\({m_3} = ({d_2} - {d_1}) \\times ({g_0} - {g_1}
    + {g_2})/2\\), \\({m_4} = ({d_1} - {d_3}){g_2}\\). Suppose the input data is one-dimensional,
    the size of output feature map Y is m and the size of filter W is r. Then (4)
    is written as a matrix in (5). $$\\begin{aligned} Y = {A^T}\\left[ {\\left( {Gg}
    \\right) \\odot \\left( {{B^T}d} \\right) } \\right] \\end{aligned}$$ (5) Similarly,
    if we assume the input data is two-dimensional, the size of output feature map
    Y is \\(m \\times m\\) and the size of filter Wis \\(r \\times r\\). Then the
    minimum filtering algorithm can be recorded as \\(F\\left( {m \\times m,r \\times
    r} \\right)\\), and the matrix of it can be expressed as below. $$\\begin{aligned}
    Y = {A^T}\\left[ {\\left( {Gg{G^T}} \\right) \\odot \\left( {{B^T}dB} \\right)
    } \\right] A \\end{aligned}$$ (6) where \\(\\odot\\) stands for element by element,
    d is the input feature block, g is the convolution kernel, and \\({A^T}\\), G,
    \\({B^T}\\) are the transformation coefficient matrixes, respectively. The values
    of \\({A^T}\\), G, \\({B^T}\\) are determined by m and r. 3 Method This section
    describes the proposed PDCNN-MRW algorithm in detail, comprising three kernels:
    batch training, updating parameters in parallel, and merging parameters in parallel.
    The schematic diagram of the PDCNN-MRW algorithm is shown in Fig. 1. In the stage
    of batch training, to reduce the calculation of redundant parameters, the FS-CSNMI
    algorithm is presented to filter out redundant features in feature maps and fuse
    the redundant features with representative features. Then the input feature maps
    of the next layer can be obtained. In the stage of updating parameters in parallel,
    to improve the capability of convolution operation, the PWC-MR strategy based
    on MapReduce is proposed, which speeds up the generation of convolution results
    by replacing convolution with parallel Winograd convolution. In the stage of merging
    parameters in parallel, the LB-MTTM strategy is designed to balance a load of
    nodes to reduce the mean response time of the whole system and improve the efficiency
    of parameters parallel merge. Fig. 1 The schematic diagram of the PDCNN-MRW algorithm

    the calculation of redundant features in the batch training, which consists of
    there parts: feature separation, feature filtering, and feature fusion. The pseudocode
    of batch training is shown in Algorithm 1. The flowchart of the FS-CSNMI strategy
    is shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 The flowchart of the FS-CSNMI strategy Full size image
    3.1.1 Feature separation The feature division aims to roughly separate the feature
    maps into the initial redundant feature set and representative feature set. The
    approach consists of three steps: (1) the feature maps are separated into sampling
    feature set S and candidate feature set C according to the ratio \\(\\alpha\\),
    and then the mean feature matrix E of S is calculated; (2) the feature similarity
    measure factor (FSM) based on cosine similarity is presented, and the feature
    maps in C are sorted in ascending order according to the FSM; (3) the sorted feature
    maps are separated into a redundant feature set R and representation feature set
    P according to the scale \\(\\alpha\\). Theorem 1 (FSM) Given the vector X and
    E, which represents the feature map X and E. Then the FSM of X with respect to
    E is expressed below. $$\\begin{aligned} FSM = SIM({\\textbf{X}},{\\textbf{E}})
    * {\\left\\| {norm(X - E)} \\right\\| _1} \\end{aligned}$$ (7) where the expressions
    of \\(SIM({\\textbf{X}},{\\textbf{E}})\\) and \\(norm(X - E)\\) are presented
    below. $$\\begin{aligned}{} & {} SIM({\\textbf{X}},{\\textbf{E}}) = 1 - \\frac{{{\\textbf{X}}*{\\textbf{E}}}}{{\\left\\|
    {\\textbf{X}} \\right\\| \\times \\left\\| {\\textbf{E}} \\right\\| }} \\end{aligned}$$
    (8) $$\\begin{aligned}{} & {} norm(X - E) = \\frac{{(X - E) - \\min (X - E)}}{{\\max
    (X - E) - \\min (X - E)}}F(Z) = P\\Lambda {P^{ - 1}} \\end{aligned}$$ (9) Proof
    Suppose SIM(X,E) represents the similarity degree between the feature map X and
    the mean eigen matrix E. The value of SIM(X,E) is proportional to the similarity
    degree between X and E. Let the norm(X - E) represents the normalized matrix of
    the difference between X and E. The offset degree between the X and E is reflected
    by the first-order norm of norm(X - E), namely, the \\({\\left\\| {norm(X - E)}
    \\right\\| _1}\\) is proportional to the offset degree. Consequently, if SIM(X,E)
    is smaller and \\({\\left\\| {norm(X - E)} \\right\\| _1}\\) is more prominent,
    the similarity between X and E is smaller. In this situation, the feature information
    of X is hard to be replaced by E. Conversely, if the SIM(X,E) is larger and the
    \\({\\left\\| {norm(X - E)} \\right\\| _1}\\) is smaller, then the similarity
    between X and E is larger. In short, the product of SIM(X,E) and \\({\\left\\|
    {norm(X - E)} \\right\\| _1}\\) can reflect the degree of similarity between X
    and E. \\(\\square\\) 3.1.2 Feature filtering The set C were roughly separated
    according to the scale \\(\\alpha\\) in the last part, which leaves a lot of redundant
    features in the set P. Thus, it is necessary to filter further the redundant features
    in the set P. To accomplish this task, a feature filtering method is proposed,
    which consists of three steps: (1) the feature association coefficient (FAC) is
    presented, then the FAC of each feature map concerning E can be obtained; (2)
    the feature maps are sorted in descending order and divided into a redundant feature
    set \\(\\widehat{R}\\) and representation feature set \\(\\widehat{P}\\) according
    to the proportion \\(\\beta\\); (3) the set \\(\\widehat{R}\\) is integrated into
    set R, and the E of set \\(\\widehat{P}\\) is calculated; (4) the step 2 and 3
    are repeated until the ratio of set R and P reaches the expected value \\(\\eta\\).
    Theorem 2 (FAC) Assume that X represents the feature maps and E represents the
    mean feature images. The FSM is the feature similarity measure between X and E.
    Then the FAC between X and E is expressed below. $$\\begin{aligned} FAC &= NMI(X,E)*FSM
    \\end{aligned}$$ (10) $$\\begin{aligned} NMI(X,E) &= \\frac{{H(X) + H(E)}}{{H(X,E)}}
    \\end{aligned}$$ (11) Proof Suppose the NMI(X, E) represents the value of NMI
    (normalized mutual information) between X and E. The larger the value of NMI(X,
    E), the stronger the correlation between X and E. Let the FSM represents the degree
    of similarity between X and E. The larger the value of FSM, the higher the similarity
    between X and E. Therefore, the product of NMI(X, E) and FSM can be used to measure
    the feature correlation degree between X and E, namely, when the value of FAC
    is large, the correlation of feature information between X and E is higher. \\(\\square\\)
    3.1.3 Feature fusion The main idea of feature fusion is to construct the input
    feature maps of the next layer by fusing the features in the set R and set P.
    The specific steps are: (1) obtaining the eigenvectors \\({{Z_R}}\\), \\({{Z_P}}\\)
    and eigenvalues \\(\\lambda\\) of each eigenmatrix in R and P; (2) the fusion
    function F(Z) is proposed to integrate the redundant feature matrix in R and P,
    thereby constructing the fusion feature set Z; (3) obtaining the final feature
    maps Y by merging Z and P. Theorem 3 (F(Z)) Given the fusion feature matrix Z,
    the function F(Z) for the feature fusion can be formulated as below. $$\\begin{aligned}
    F(Z) & = P\\Lambda {P^{ - 1}} \\end{aligned}$$ (12) $$\\begin{aligned} p & = \\left[
    {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{Z_1}}&\\quad {{Z_2}}&\\quad \\cdots&\\quad {{Z_m}}
    \\end{array}} \\right] ,{p^{ - 1}} = {\\left[ {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{Z_1}}&\\quad
    {{Z_2}}&\\quad \\cdots&\\quad {{Z_m}} \\end{array}} \\right] ^{ - 1}} \\end{aligned}$$
    (13) $$\\begin{aligned} \\Lambda & = \\left[ {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{\\lambda
    _1}}&{}\\quad {}&{}\\quad {}\\\\ {}&{} \\quad \\ddots &{}{}\\\\ {}&{}{}&{}\\quad
    {{\\lambda _m}} \\end{array}} \\right] \\end{aligned}$$ (14) $$\\begin{aligned}
    {Z_i} & = {Z_X} + {Z_Y} \\cdot \\cos {\\theta _i} \\end{aligned}$$ (15) $$\\begin{aligned}
    {\\theta _i} & = \\arccos \\left( \\frac{{{Z_X} * {Z_X}}}{{\\left\\| {{Z_X}} \\right\\|
    \\times \\left\\| {{Z_Y}} \\right\\| }}\\right) \\end{aligned}$$ (16) where \\({Z_X}\\)
    and \\({Z_Y}\\) represent the eigenvectors of the eigenmatrices X and Y, respectively
    \\({\\lambda _1,\\lambda _2,\\ldots ,\\lambda _m}\\) represents the eigenvalues
    of the eigenmatrix X, and \\(\\theta\\) indicates the cosine angle between the
    eigenvectors \\({Z_X}\\) and \\({Z_Y}\\). Proof Suppose \\({Z_i}\\) represents
    the eigenvalue of Z and \\({\\lambda _i}\\) represents the eigenvector of Z. Then,
    the equation for Z and \\({Z_i}\\) is presented below. $$\\begin{aligned} Z \\times
    {Z_i} = {Z_i} \\times {\\lambda _i},\\quad i \\in [1,m] \\end{aligned}$$ (17)
    where \\({Z_i} = {Z_X} + {Z_Y} \\cdot \\cos \\theta\\). Set \\({Z_X}\\) and \\({Z_Y}\\)
    individually represents the eigenvectors of X and Y, and \\(\\theta\\) is the
    cosine angle between \\({Z_X}\\) and \\({Z_Y}\\), then the \\({Z_Y} \\cdot \\cos
    \\theta\\) can be used to represent the projection \\({Z_{Y/X}}\\) of \\({Z_Y}\\)
    onto \\({Z_X}\\). Thus, \\({Z_i}\\) can be formulated as below. $$\\begin{aligned}
    {Z_i} = {Z_X} + {Z_{Y/X}} = {Z_X} + \\frac{{{Z_X}}}{{\\left\\| {{Z_X}} \\right\\|
    }} \\cdot \\left\\| {{Z_{Y/X}}} \\right\\| = \\left(1 + \\frac{{\\left\\| {{Z_{Y/X}}}
    \\right\\| }}{{\\left\\| {{Z_X}} \\right\\| }}\\right) \\cdot {Z_X} \\end{aligned}$$
    (18) Equation (15) can be expressed as below. $$\\begin{aligned} Z \\times \\left(1
    + \\frac{{\\left\\| {{Z_{Y/X}}} \\right\\| }}{{\\left\\| {{Z_X}} \\right\\| }}\\right)
    \\cdot {Z_X} = \\left(1 + \\frac{{\\left\\| {{Z_{Y/X}}} \\right\\| }}{{\\left\\|
    {{Z_X}} \\right\\| }}\\right) \\cdot {Z_X} \\times {\\lambda _i},\\quad i \\in
    [1,m] \\end{aligned}$$ (19) \\(\\square\\) Since the eigenvalues of Z are equal
    to the eigenvalues of X, the equation about \\({Z_X}\\) can be expressed as below.
    $$\\begin{aligned} X \\times {Z_X} = {Z_X} \\times {\\lambda _i},\\quad i \\in
    [1,m] \\end{aligned}$$ (20) where \\({Z_X} \\times {({Z_X})^{ - 1}} = E\\) ( E
    is the unit matrix). Then, the equation about \\({Z_i}\\) is observed below. $$\\begin{aligned}
    \\begin{array}{ll} {Z_i} \\times {({Z_i})^{ - 1}} &{}= \\left( {\\left( 1 + \\frac{{\\left\\|
    {{Z_{Y/X}}} \\right\\| }}{{\\left\\| {{Z_X}} \\right\\| }}\\right) \\cdot {Z_X}}
    \\right) \\times {\\left( {\\left( 1 + \\frac{{\\left\\| {{Z_{Y/X}}} \\right\\|
    }}{{\\left\\| {{Z_X}} \\right\\| }}\\right) \\cdot {Z_X}} \\right) ^{ - 1}}\\\\
    &{}= {Z_X} \\times {({Z_X})^{ - 1}} = E \\end{array} \\end{aligned}$$ (21) Knowing
    from (21), \\({Z_i}\\) is reversible. Here, we multiply the right of (19) by \\({({Z_i})^{
    - 1}}\\). $$\\begin{aligned} Z = {Z_i} \\times {\\lambda _i} \\times {({Z_i})^{
    - 1}},\\quad i \\in [1,m] \\end{aligned}$$ (22) Set $$\\begin{aligned} P & = \\left[
    {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{Z_1}}&\\quad {{Z_2}}&\\quad \\cdots&\\quad {{Z_m}}
    \\end{array}} \\right] \\end{aligned}$$ (23) $$\\begin{aligned} \\Lambda & = \\left[
    {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{\\lambda _1}}&{}\\quad {}&{}\\quad {}\\\\ {}&{} \\quad
    \\ddots &{}{}\\\\ {}&{}{}&{}\\quad {{\\lambda _m}} \\end{array}} \\right] \\end{aligned}$$
    (24) Then the m equations in (20) are combined. The result is as follows. $$\\begin{aligned}
    F(Z) = \\left[ {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{Z_1}}&\\quad {{Z_2}}&\\quad \\cdots&\\quad
    {{Z_m}} \\end{array}} \\right] \\left[ {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{\\lambda _1}}&{}{}&{}{}\\\\
    {}&{} \\quad \\ddots &{}{}\\\\ {}&{}{}&{}\\quad {{\\lambda _m}} \\end{array}}
    \\right] {\\left[ {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{Z_1}}&\\quad {{Z_2}}&\\quad \\cdots&\\quad
    {{Z_m}} \\end{array}} \\right] ^{ - 1}} = P\\Lambda {P^{ - 1}} \\end{aligned}$$
    (25) Algorithm 1 Batch Training 3.2 Updating parameters in parallel As previously
    stated, the main goal of this stage is to improve the capability of the convolution
    operation. Therefore, the PWC-MR strategy based on MapReduce is presented to replace
    general convolution operation, which consists of there parts: feature map segmentation,
    parallel Winograd convolution, and updating parameters. The pseudocode of updating
    parameters in parallel is shown in Algorithm 2. The flowchart of the PWC-MR strategy
    is shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 The flowchart of the PWC-MR strategy Full size image
    3.2.1 Feature map segmentation The input feature map needs to be segmented to
    realize the parallel computation of Winograd convolution. Therefore, the MTS (Multi-tree
    Segmentation) strategy is presented, which consists of the following steps: (1)
    the function ESS(X) is proposed to segment the feature map at equal size, thereby
    the sub-feature maps \\({X_{11}},{X_{12}},{X_{21}},{X_{22}}\\) with equal size
    can be constructed; (2) the function EDS(X) is proposed to segment the feature
    map again at the same distance. Then the sub-feature maps D with the same distance
    can be constructed; (3) the \\({X_{11}},{X_{12}},{X_{21}},{X_{22}}\\) and D are
    taken as the child nodes of the next floor in the multi-tree (the original feature
    map is taken as the root node of the multi-tree), and then the \\({X_{11}},{X_{12}},{X_{21}},{X_{22}}\\)
    of the child nodes are divided in the same process of segmentation; (4) the above
    procedure is repeated until the sub-feature maps cannot be segmented, then the
    multi-tree of the input feature map can be obtained. Theorem 4 (ESS(X)) Set the
    step size is s, the size of the original feature map X is \\({h_{in}} \\times
    {w_{in}}\\), the size of the convolution kernel W is \\(f \\times f\\), the size
    of the input feature map after filling is \\(2k \\times 2k\\), and the size of
    the sub-feature map after slicing is \\({h_{sub}} \\times {w_{sub}}\\). Then the
    function ESS(X) is shown below. $$\\begin{aligned} ESS(X) = \\left[ {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}}
    {{X_{11}}}&{}\\quad {{X_{12}}}\\\\ {{X_{21}}}&{}\\quad {{X_{22}}} \\end{array}}
    \\right] \\in {R^{2{h_{sub}} \\times 2{w_{sub}}}} \\end{aligned}$$ (26) where
    \\({X_{11}},{X_{12}},{X_{21}},{X_{22}} \\in {R^{{h_{sub}} \\times {w_{sub}}}}\\),
    and the expressions of them are specified as below. $$\\begin{aligned} {X_{11}}

    - 2s}}{2},{w_{sub}} = \\frac{{2k + f - 2s}}{2} \\end{aligned}$$ (28) Proof It
    is known that the size of X is \\({h_{in}} \\times {w_{in}}\\), the size of W
    is \\(f \\times f\\), the step size is s, and the size of the input feature map
    expands to \\(2k \\times 2k\\). Then the size of Y after convolution operation
    can be expressed as \\({h_{out}} \\times {w_{out}}\\). The expressions is as follows.
    $$\\begin{aligned} {h_{out}} & = \\left\\lfloor {\\frac{{2k - f}}{s}} \\right\\rfloor
    + 1,{w_{out}} = \\left\\lfloor {\\frac{{2k - f}}{s}} \\right\\rfloor + 1 \\end{aligned}$$
    (29) $$\\begin{aligned} X * W & = Y \\end{aligned}$$ (30) Suppose the size of
    the sub-feature map after slicing is \\({h_{sub}} \\times {w_{sub}}\\), we have
    following expressions. $$\\begin{aligned}{} & {} \\begin{array}{l} h_{out}^{[sub]}

    of \\({X_{11}},{X_{12}},{X_{21}},{X_{22}}\\) in the matrix, the X is segmented
    accordingly. Meanwhile, the size of each sub-feature map is guaranteed to be \\({h_{sub}}
    \\times {w_{sub}}\\). Then the function ESS(X) can be obtained as below. $$\\begin{aligned}

    original feature map X is \\({h_{in}} \\times {w_{in}}\\), the size of the W is
    \\(f \\times f\\), the step size is s, the number of the filled pixel blocks on
    the left and right sides is \\({p_0}\\), the number of the filled pixel blocks
    on the upper and lower sides is \\({p_1}\\), and the size of the sub-feature map
    D after segmenting is \\(2k \\times 2f\\). Then the function EDS(X) can be obtained
    as below. $$\\begin{aligned} EDS(X) = D = \\left[ {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{D_{11}}}&\\quad

    known to be \\({h_{in}} \\times {w_{in}}\\), the size of W is \\(f \\times f\\),
    and the step size is s. The input feature map is filled with a size of \\(2k \\times
    2k\\). Then the output feature map Y(\\(Y \\in {R^{{h_{out}} \\times {w_{out}}}}\\))
    of X(\\(X \\in {R^{{h_{in}} \\times {w_{in}}}}\\)) is obtained after undergoing
    convolution operation, where \\({h_{out}}\\) and \\({w_{out}}\\) are expressed
    as follows: $$\\begin{aligned}{} & {} {h_{out}} = \\left\\lfloor {\\frac{{2k -

    + 1 \\end{aligned}$$ (39) $$\\begin{aligned}{} & {} X * W = Y \\end{aligned}$$
    (40) Given the \\({X_{11}},{X_{12}},{X_{21}},{X_{22}} \\in {R^{{h_{sub}} \\times
    {w_{sub}}}}\\) obtained by the function ESS(X) and the output feature map \\({Y_X}
    \\in {R^{2h_{out}^{[sub]} \\times 2w_{out}^{[sub]}}}\\) obtained by the convolution
    operation, then the corresponding expression is computed as follows. $$\\begin{aligned}{}
    & {} 2h_{out}^{[sub]} = 2\\left\\lfloor {\\frac{{k - f/2}}{s}} \\right\\rfloor
    = \\left\\lfloor {\\frac{{2k - f}}{s}} \\right\\rfloor ,2w_{out}^{[sub]} = \\left\\lfloor
    {\\frac{{2k - f}}{s}} \\right\\rfloor \\end{aligned}$$ (41) $$\\begin{aligned}{}

    {{Y_{11}}}&{}\\quad {{Y_{12}}}\\\\ {{Y_{21}}}&{}\\quad {{Y_{22}}} \\end{array}}
    \\right] \\end{aligned}$$ (42) The comparison reveals that the dimensions of the
    output feature maps Y and \\({Y_X}\\) differ by only 1. To ensure the consistency
    of the output feature map after convolution, the midpoint of the input feature
    map needs to be used as the starting point of the segmentation, and the input
    feature map needs to be segmented again to construct the sub-feature map \\({D_{11}},D_{21}^T
    \\in {R^{f \\times 2k}}\\). The expressions are specified as below. $$\\begin{aligned}

    are merged with the \\({Y_X}\\). Meanwhile, \\({{\\textbf{Y}}_{{\\mathbf{D[1]}}}}\\)
    is taken as the row vector, and \\({{\\textbf{Y}}_{{\\mathbf{D[2]}}}}\\) is taken
    as the column vector \\({\\left[ {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{y_{2,1}}}&\\cdots&{{y_{2,{h_{out}}}}}

    variables is shown below. $$\\begin{aligned} \\begin{array}{l} {{\\textbf{Y}}_{{\\mathbf{D[1]}}}},{{\\textbf{Y}}_{{\\mathbf{D[2]}}}}

    can be obtained after merging, as described in Eq. (47). $$\\begin{aligned} {{\\textbf{Y}}_{\\textbf{C}}}
    = \\left[ {\\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{{\\left( {{Y_{11}}} \\right) }_{h_{out}^{[sub]}

    is \\(2h_{out}^{[sub]} \\times 2w_{out}^{[sub]}\\), which is the same as the size
    of the Y obtained after the convolution of the original feature map X. The specific
    expression is as follows. $$\\begin{aligned} 2h_{out}^{[sub]} \\times 2w_{out}^{[sub]}

    Winograd convolution The method of parallel Winograd convolution can be carried
    out based on MapReduce after obtaining the multi-tree of each feature map. The
    main steps of the method are: (1) the multi-tree T of each feature map is constructed
    in parallel; (2) the T is traversed layer by layer to obtain the sub-feature map
    sequence S, while the corresponding Winograd transformation between the sub-feature
    map \\({S_i}\\) and the convolution kernel \\({W_k}\\) is performed; (3) the transformed
    result is mapped as the key-value pairs \\(< {S_i},{W_k} >\\) and stored in HDFS;
    (4) the function Map() is used to compute the convolution result of \\({S_i}\\)
    in parallel according to the key values \\(< {S_i},{W_k} >\\); (5) the intermediate
    convolution result is mapped as the key-value pair \\(< {S_i},{Y_{si,k}}>\\) and
    temporarily stored in Combine; (6) the intermediate convolution result is read,
    and the function Reduce() is used to merge the convolution result \\({Y_{si}}\\)
    of each sub-feature map in parallel; (7) the convolution result \\({Y_{si}}\\)
    is mapped as the key-value pair \\(< {S_i},{Y_{si}} >\\) and stored in HDFS. (8)
    the convolution result of \\({S_i}\\) is read from HDFS and the output feature
    map Y can be obtained by merging the \\({Y_{si}}\\) according to the order of
    S; (9) the Y is stored in HDFS for the parameter update stage. The operation process
    of parallel Winograd convolution is shown in Fig. 4. Here, the size of the input
    feature map is \\(7 \\times 7\\), the size of the convolution kernel is \\(3 \\times
    3\\), the step size is 1, and the total number of filled pixel blocks around is
    0. Fig. 4 The operation process of parallel Winograd convolution Full size image
    3.2.3 Updating parameters After calculating parallel Winograd Convolution, the
    updating of the parameters can be performed. The conduction error and the weight
    change of each convolution layer are calculated in parallel with the formula of
    back-propagation. The steps of the method are: (1) the conduction error \\(\\delta
    _k^{l - 1}\\) of convolution kernel \\(W_k^{l - 1}\\) at layer \\(l - 1\\) is
    obtained according to the formula of back-propagation. Subsequently, the result
    is mapped as a key-value pair \\(< W_k^{l - 1},\\delta _k^{l - 1}>\\) and stored
    in HDFS; (2) the function Reduce() is used to merge the \\(\\delta _k^{l - 1}\\)
    stored in HDFS, and then the total conduction error \\(\\delta _{}^{l - 1}\\)
    can be obtained. (3) calculating the weight change \\(\\Delta {W_k}\\) of \\({W_k}\\)
    in each model and updating the parameters in \\({W_k}\\) according to the \\(\\Delta
    {W_k}\\); (4) the results after updating are mapped as \\(< {W_k},\\Delta {W_k}>\\)
    and stored in HDFS. Algorithm 2 Updating Parameters in Parallel 3.3 Merging parameters
    in parallel The goal of the proposed LB-MTTM strategy based on task migration
    is to improve the efficiency of parameter parallelization by balancing the task
    load among nodes. There are three main parts to the LB-MTTM strategy: IR-tree
    construction, migration queue construction, and parameters combination in parallel.
    The pseudocode of the parameters parallel merge is shown in Algorithm 3. 3.3.1
    IR-tree construction The information of all task nodes is collected and sorted
    in ascending order according to their capacity. Subsequently, the sorted task
    nodes are stored in the Nodes array. The IR-tree (information retrieval tree)
    is constructed to retrieve the nodes’ information faster and regulate the load
    between nodes. It stores the information of task nodes in the Nodes array. The
    steps to construct the information retrieval trees (T1 and T2) are: (1) obtaining
    the median load \\({L_0}(t)\\) in the array Nodes at moment t and using the \\({L_0}(t)\\)
    as the cut-off point of the load size of each node; (2) the nodes that load lower
    than \\({L_0}(t)\\) are move into the T1, and the rest are moved into the T2;
    (3) the number of nodes in the T1 need to be less than that of T2, and the excess
    nodes in the T1 need to be moved into the T2, which ensure a total load of nodes
    in T1 and T2 can be adjusted quickly; (4) To promptly retrieve the node information,
    the first precursor cue of the T1 is connected to the last successor cue of the
    T2, and the first precursor cue of the T2 is connected to the previous successor
    cue of the T1. The example in Fig. 5 provides the T1 and T2 constructed by the
    node queue with 14 Nodes. Fig. 5 The example of IR-Tree construction Full size
    image 3.3.2 IR-tree node description The IR-tree is a balanced binary tree with
    clue pointers. The corresponding information of the task node is stored in the
    Nodes and can be further retrieved by the node index. Specifically, the left and
    right pointers of IR-tree node are left-element and right-element, while left-flag
    and right-flag serve as the left and right pointers to the flag bits of node types,
    respectively. If the flag bit is 0, the node is the left or right child; if the
    flag bit is 1, the node is the precursor or rear-drive cue; and if the flag bit
    is 2, the node is connected by a precursor cue or next cue. The diagram of the
    IR-tree node is shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 The diagram of the IR-tree node Full size
    image 3.3.3 Migration queue construction The task migration route is constructed
    according to the set migration threshold after constructing the IR-tree. The method
    is divided into three steps: (1) the DLMT (Dynamic Load Migration Threshold) is
    proposed to set the threshold of task migration. Subsequently, the upper limit
    of load intake in T1 is set as \\({L_\\alpha }(t)\\), and the lower limit of load
    removal in T2 is set as \\({L_\\beta }(t)\\); (2) the node with the lowest load
    rate \\({N_{min}}\\)and the node with the highest load rate \\({N_{max}}\\) are
    obtained from T1 and T2, respectively. (3) if \\({N_{min}}\\) and \\({N_{max}}\\)
    meet the migration threshold, a task migration route from \\({N_{max}}\\) to \\({N_{min}}\\)
    will be constructed according to the migration threshold and then the \\(< {N_{max}},{N_{min}}>\\)
    is moved into the migration queue Q; (4) if \\({N_{min}}\\) and \\({N_{max}}\\)
    cannot meet the migration threshold, and the migration route will be discarded;
    (5) the above construction process is repeated until no nodes satisfy the threshold
    value in T1 and T2. Theorem 6 (DLMT) Assuming that the median loads in the T1
    and T2 at the moment t are \\({L_{m1}}(t)\\) and \\({L_{m2}}(t)\\), the mean loads
    in the T1 and T2 are \\(\\overline{{L_1}(t)}\\) and \\(\\overline{{L_2}(t)}\\),
    and the upper limit of load intake and the lower limit of load removal are \\({L_\\alpha
    }(t)\\) and \\({L_\\beta }(t)\\). Then, the dynamic load migration threshold is
    given below. $$\\begin{aligned} \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l} {L_\\alpha }{\\mathrm{(t)}}
    = {L_{m1}}(t),\\\\ {L_\\beta }{\\mathrm{(t)}} = {L_{m2}}(t)\\overline{{L_1}(t)}
    + \\overline{{L_2}(t)} < {L_{m1}}(t) + {L_{m2}}(t)\\\\ {L_\\alpha }{\\mathrm{(t)}}
    =Max(\\overline{{L_1}(t)},{L_{m1}}(t)),\\\\ {L_\\beta }{\\mathrm{(t)}} = Min(\\overline{{L_2}(t)},{L_{m2}}(t))\\overline{{L_1}(t)}
    + \\overline{{L_2}(t)} > = {L_{m1}}(t) + {L_{m2}}(t) \\end{array} \\right. \\end{aligned}$$
    (49) Proof Since the T1 and T2 are both balanced binary trees, the difference
    in the number of nodes between them is no more than 1. When the median of the
    load in T1 and T2 is closer to the mean value of the respective load, the node
    load in T1 and T2 is closer to the mean value of the cluster’s overall load, which
    can be expressed as below. $$\\begin{aligned} \\begin{array}{l} \\overline{L(t)}
    = \\frac{{\\overline{{L_1}(t)} + \\overline{{L_2}(t)} }}{2} = \\frac{{{L_{m1}}(t)
    + {L_{m2}}(t)}}{2};\\\\ {L_{m1}}(t) \\rightarrow \\overline{{L_1}(t)},{L_{m2}}(t)
    \\rightarrow \\overline{{L_2}(t)}; \\end{array} \\end{aligned}$$ (50) When \\(\\overline{{L_1}(t)}
    + \\overline{{L_2}(t)} < {L_{m1}}(t) + {L_{m2}}(t)\\), it indicates that the average
    load of the cluster is lower than the median load, namely, the load of cluster
    is imbalance. In this case, the upper limit of T1 needs to be adjusted to \\({L_{m1}}(t)\\),
    and the lower limit of T2 needs to be adjusted to \\({L_{m2}}(t)\\). After performing
    task migration of T1 and T2, the mean values of T1 and T2 can be brought closer
    to the load median, and the cluster can reach the load balance state. When \\(\\overline{{L_1}(t)}
    + \\overline{{L_2}(t)} > = {L_{m1}}(t) + {L_{m2}}(t)\\), means that there are
    still some nodes with an unbalanced load. Therefore, the upper migration limit
    of T1 needs to be adjusted to the maximum value between the mean and the median,
    and the lower migration limit of T2 needs to be adjusted to the minimum value
    between the mean and the median. After performing the task migration of T1 and
    T2, the average load values of T1 and T2 can be close to each other, which promotes
    the cluster to achieve load balance. In short, the DMLT can regulate the task
    migration direction of each node in the cluster to ensure the total load balance
    of the cluster. \\(\\square\\) 3.3.4 Parameters combination in parallel After
    constructing the migration queue, the corresponding migration task can be executed
    according to the current migration route and threshold. Later, the Reduce () function
    is called to perform parameters combination in parallel. The steps involved in
    parallel parameters combination are: (1) the first node \\(< {N_{from}},{N_{to}}>\\)
    of the migration queue is taken out. The unprocessed tasks are removed from the
    node \\({N_{from}}\\) and sent to the node \\({N_{to}}\\) according to the current
    migration route and threshold; (2) if either node \\({N_{from}}\\) or \\({N_{to}}\\)
    reaches the migration threshold, the current migration task will be terminated;
    (3) the mean load \\(\\overline{{L_1}(t)}\\) and \\(\\overline{{L_2}(t)}\\) of
    T1 and T2 nodes at moment t are calculated; (4) the migration process is terminated
    if \\(\\overline{{L_1}(t)} + \\overline{{L_2}(t)} < {L_\\alpha }(t) + {L_\\beta
    }(t)\\), otherwise, the migration task in the migration queue is continued until
    the migration queue is empty; (5) the Reduce() function is called to merge the
    key-value pairs \\(< key = {W_k},value = \\Delta {W_k}>\\) output by each map
    node, and then the merged weights are taken as the final weights after model training.
    Algorithm 3 Parameters Parallel Combination 3.4 Time complexity To effectively
    analyze the time complexity of the PDCNN-MRW, the algorithms SASTCNN, NG-CNN,
    Parallel CNN-ELM and PCNN-GAP are selected for comparison with it. Among these
    algorithms, SASTCNN uses a parallel matrix multiplication algorithm to perform
    convolutional operations with better execution efficiency and stability. NG-CNN
    removes Gaussian noise from the input image and combines the autoencoder with
    DCNN model to improve the recognition accuracy and training efficiency. The Parallel
    CNN-ELM algorithm combines an Extreme Learning Machine with a lightweight CNN
    model for parallel training, which is able to recognize CXR images with high accuracy.
    The PCNN-GAP algorithm improves the CNN by using global average pooling during
    the parallel training of the model and effectively extracts the features of the
    image by resampling and segmentation, which in turn improves the training performance
    of the model. Therefore the above algorithms are used to analyze the time complexity
    of the PDCNN-MRW and the comparison is made in the concrete experiment. The time
    complexity of the PDCNN-MRW algorithm mainly consists of three stages: batch training,
    updating parameters in parallel, and merging parameters in parallel. Their specific
    calculation process is as follows. 3.4.1 Batch training The time complexity of
    this stage consists of three parts: feature separation, feature filtering, and
    feature fusion. Assume the size of the sampling feature set and candidate feature
    set obtained by feature division are s and c, respectively. The size of the redundant
    feature set and representational feature set obtained by feature filtering are
    r and p, respectively. The iterative filtering times are q, and the size of the
    fusion feature matrix used in feature fusion is \\({w_f} \\times {h_f}\\)(\\({w_f}
    < {h_f}\\)). Then the time complexity \\({T_1}\\) of the batch training is expressed
    as: $$\\begin{aligned} {T_1} = O\\left( {s + c + c\\log c} \\right) + O\\left(
    {q(p + p\\log p + r)} \\right) + O\\left( {r \\cdot p \\cdot {w_f}} \\right) \\end{aligned}$$
    (51) 3.4.2 Updating parameters in parallel The time complexity of this stage consists
    of three parts: feature map segmentation, parallel Winograd convolution, and feature
    map combination. In the segmentation part, two factors influence the time complexity:
    the function ESS(X) and the function EDS(X). Thus, the time complexity can be
    expressed as \\(O(({4^h} - 1)/3) + O(h)\\)(\\(h = \\left\\lfloor {\\log (2k/m)}
    \\right\\rfloor\\)), assuming the feature map size after filling is \\(2k \\times
    2k\\), the minimum size of the sub-feature map after segmenting is \\(m \\times
    m\\). In the parallel convolution part, the time complexity of performing one
    Winograd convolution \\(F(m \\times m,k \\times k)\\) is given as \\(O((1 + \\beta
    + \\gamma + \\delta ) \\cdot {(m - k + 1)^2})\\), assuming the \\(\\beta\\),\\(\\gamma\\)
    and \\(\\delta\\) are the number of floating-point instructions used for a single
    block during the Winograd conversion, respectively. Hence the time complexity
    of parallel Winograd convolution can be expressed as \\(O(({4^h} + h) \\cdot (1
    + \\beta + \\gamma + \\delta ) \\cdot {(m - k + 1)^2})\\). In the combination
    part, the subfeature map is merged from the bottom to the top according to the
    sequence structure of the IR-tree. Then the time complexity of this part can be
    expressed as \\(O(({4^{(h - 1)}} - 1)/3)\\). To sum up, the time complexity \\({T_2}\\)
    of the parallel updating stage of parameters is defined as: $$\\begin{aligned}
    {T_2} & = O\\left( {\\frac{{({4^h} + {4^{(h - 1)}} - 2)}}{3} + h} \\right) \\nonumber
    \\\\&\\quad +O\\left( {({4^h} + h) \\cdot (1 + \\beta + \\gamma + \\delta ) \\cdot
    {{(m - k + 1)}^2}} \\right) ,h = \\left\\lfloor {\\log \\frac{{2k}}{m}} \\right\\rfloor
    \\end{aligned}$$ (52) 3.4.3 Merging parameters in parallel The time complexity
    of this stage depends on the construction and update of the IR-tree. When constructing
    the IR-tree, it is necessary first to sort the array containing d nodes information.
    After creating, it is also required to conduct middle-order queuing for IR-tree
    again. Therefore, the time complexity of IR-tree construction is expressed as
    \\(O(d\\log d) + O(d\\log (d/2)) + O(d)\\); When updating IR-tree, if the length
    of the task migration queue is b, then the time complexity of updating the information
    retrieval tree is expressed as \\(O(b\\log (b/2))\\). To sum up, the time complexity
    \\({T_3}\\) of parameter parallel combination stage is expressed as: $$\\begin{aligned}
    {T_3} = O(d\\log d) + O\\left( d\\log \\left( \\frac{d}{2}\\right) \\right) +
    O(d) + O\\left( b\\log \\left( \\frac{b}{2}\\right) \\right) \\end{aligned}$$
    (53) In conclusion, the time complexity of the PDCNN-MRW algorithm is the sum
    of the above three stages, namely: $$\\begin{aligned} {T_{PDCNN - MRW}} = {T_1}
    + {T_2} + {T_3} \\end{aligned}$$ (54) Moreover, the time complexity of training
    the DCNN model in a big data environment mainly depends on the convolution calculation.
    In other words, it can be concluded that \\({T_2} \\gg {T_1},{T_3}\\). To the
    traditional convolution, the main operation involves the multiplication of the
    convolution kernel by the feature map. Thus, the time complexity is expressed
    as below. $$\\begin{aligned} {T_{Conv}} = O\\left( {\\sum \\limits _{l = 1}^D
    {{M_l}^2 \\cdot K_l^2 \\cdot {C_{l - 1}} \\cdot {C_l} \\cdot u} } \\right) \\end{aligned}$$
    (55) where u is the number of nodes, D is the number of convolution layers, \\({C_l}\\)
    is the number of convolution kernels for the convolution layer l, \\({M_l}\\)
    is the size of the feature map and \\({K_l}\\) is the size of the convolution
    kernel. The Winograd convolution reduces the multiplication times by a series
    of transformations on the feature map and the weight. Thus, the time complexity
    is expressed as below. $$\\begin{aligned} {T_{Winograd}} = O\\left( {{{(m - k
    + 1)}^2}\\sum \\limits _{l = 1}^D {{{\\left( \\frac{{{M_l}}}{m}\\right) }^2} \\cdot
    {{\\left( \\frac{{K_l^{}}}{k}\\right) }^2} \\cdot {C_{l - 1}} \\cdot {C_l} \\cdot
    u} } \\right) \\end{aligned}$$ (56) To the SASTCNN algorithm using parallel matrix
    multiplication, the time complexity of model training is: $$\\begin{aligned} {T_{SASTCNN}}
    = O\\left( {\\sum \\limits _{l = 1}^D {{{({M_l} - {M_0})}^2} \\cdot {K_l}^2 \\cdot
    {C_{l - 1}} \\cdot {C_l} \\cdot u} } \\right) \\end{aligned}$$ (57) where \\({M_0}\\)
    is the number of 0 in matrix multiplication. As previously mentioned, algorithms
    such as NG-CNN, Parallel CNN-ELM and PCNN-GAP all use conventional convolutional
    operations during parallel training, and their time complexity can be approximately
    equal to \\({T_{conv}}\\). Since \\({T_{conv}}\\gg {T_{Winograd}}\\), we can then
    conclude that \\({T_{NG-CNN}} \\gg {T_{PDCNN - MRW}}\\), \\({T_{Parallel CNN-ELM}}
    \\gg {T_{PDCNN - MRW}}\\), and \\({T_{PCNN-GAP}}\\gg {T_{PDCNN - MRW}}\\). In
    addition, the parallel matrix multiplication has a limited effect on the efficiency
    of convolution operation in high-density computing, thus the time complexity of
    SASTCNN is still higher than PDCNN-MRW, namely, \\({T_{ SASTCNN}} \\gg {T_{PDCNN
    - MRW}}\\). To sum up, the PDCNN-MRW algorithm has ideal time complexity in a
    big data environment. 4 Experimental evaluation This section describes the experimental
    setting and verifies the effectiveness of PDCNN-MRW in optimizing DCNN model training.
    4.1 Experimental settings The specific configuration of the cluster nodes is presented
    in Table 1. All nodes had an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-13700kf, 32 GB RAM, eight processing
    units, and a GPU of NVIDIA RTX 4070ti 12 G, which is connected via 1 Gb/s Ethernet.
    One of the machines is designated as the master node, and the others are designated
    as slaves/workers. The algorithm is implemented in Java and runs on Ubuntu. The
    software packages include JDK 16.0.2, Ubuntu 18.04, and Hadoop 3.2.3. Table 1
    The specific configuration of each node Full size table 4.2 Experimental dataset
    To verify the performance of the PDCNN-MRW algorithm, we select the following
    four real datasets. The specific information about the dataset is shown in Table
    2. The ISIC 2019 dataset [22] contains skin lesion images for melanoma classification,
    which has 25,331 images available for the classification of dermoscopic images
    among 9 different diagnostic categories. The BloodCellImages dataset [23] contains
    12,500 enhanced blood cell images with cell type label (CSV). There are about
    3000 images for each of the 4 different cell types, which are grouped into four
    different folders. The cell types are eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and
    neutrophils. The PatchCamelyon (PCam) dataset [24] is a collection of 327,680
    images (\\(28 \\times 28\\)), which is divided into 229,376 images for training
    and 98,304 images for testing. Each image is labeled with a binary label indicating
    the presence of metastatic tissue. ImageNet [25] is the world’s most popular image
    recognition dataset. The ImageNet 1K dataset contains 1.28 million training images
    and 50,000 validation images of 1000 object categories. The images in this dataset
    are adjusted to \\(224 \\times 224\\) by border padding due to inconsistent pixels
    between different images. Table 2 Experimental datasets Full size table 4.3 Experimental
    result and analysis To evaluate the effectiveness of PDCNN-MRW on different datasets,
    we selected a variety of algorithms for comparative experimental analysis. And
    the running time, accuracy, and speedup ratio are used as evaluation indexes.
    1. Running time For evaluating the running time [26], we choose datasets of different
    sizes as test data (Table 2). Each is tested five times. The running time is shown
    in Fig. 7a, b. Figure 7a shows the parallel training time performance of PDCNN-MRW
    with recent algorithms SASTCNN, NG-CNN, Parallel CNN-ELM and PCNN-GAP on four
    datasets. And Fig. 7b shows the parallel training time performance of PDCNN-MRW
    with the traditional models CNN-LSTM [27], CNN-GRU [28], and CNN-BILSTM [29] on
    four datasets. From Fig. 7a, it can be seen that the running time of PDCNN-MRW
    is 80.10% of SASTCNN, 54.44% of NG-CNN, 64.73% of that of Parallel CNN-ELM, and
    71.52% of PCNN-GAP, respectively, when processing the ISIC 2019 dataset. In addition,
    the running time of the PDCNN-MRW algorithm increases slowly with the size of
    the dataset, while the other algorithms increase geometrically. In particular,
    when processing the largest ImageNet 1K dataset, the runtime of PDCNN-MRW is 64.73%
    of SASTCNN, 51.66% of that of NG-CNN, 61.2% of that of Parallel CNN-ELM and 69.53%
    of PCNN-GAP.This result is because the PDCNN-MRW performed model pretraining before
    image classification, which not only reduces the computational cost but also speeds
    up the model training. Compared to large-scale datasets, executing the PDCNN-MRW
    on small-scale datasets increases the ratio of pretraining time, which significantly
    affects the algorithm execution speed. Thus, the MR-PWFC algorithm saves more
    time on large datasets. Fig. 7 The running time of each algorithm on four datasets
    Full size image In addition, as shown in Fig. 7b, the running time of PDCNN-MRW
    is also lower than conventional algorithms. In particular, when training the ImageNet
    1K dataset, the running time of PDCNN-MRW is 57.89% of CNN-LSTM, 62.51% of CNN-GRU,
    and 47.79% of CNN-BILSTM, respectively. This is due to the excessive number of
    parameters in the conventional models such as CNN-LSTM and CNN-BILSTM, which aggravates
    the burden of training and thus leads to high running time. For CNN-GRU with a
    small number of parameters, the model uses traditional CNN to extract features,
    which is too slow in efficiency when dealing with a large amount of data. As a
    result, the running time of these models is higher than that of the PDCNN-MRW
    algorithm when trained in parallel. 2. Accuracy comparison To analyze the classification
    accuracy of PDCNN-MRW, comparative experiments are conducted with the recent algorithms
    and traditional models in four datasets. The input images are divided into 150
    batches for training. The values and number of batches are recorded when the classification
    accuracy reached a steady state. In the process of analyzing results, classification
    accuracy [30] is chosen as the criterion. The accuracy of image classification
    is the ratio of the number of correctly classified samples to the total number
    of samples, and it is defined as below. $$\\begin{aligned} {\\textrm{Accuracy}}
    = \\frac{{TP + TN}}{{FP + FN + TP + TN}} \\end{aligned}$$ (58) where TP is true
    positive, TN is true negative, FP is false positive, and FN is false negative.
    Table 3 The running time of each algorithm and model on four datasets Full size
    table From Table 3, it can be seen that the classification accuracy of each algorithm
    is higher than the case of using only DCNN model when dealing with different datasets.
    And the classification accuracy of our proposed PDCNN-MRW algorithm is always
    higher than other algorithms. For instance, when dealing with the small-scale
    dataset ISIC 2019, the accuracy of PDCNN-MRW is higher than the recent algorithms
    and the traditional model by 1.60%, 4.75%, 1.48%, 2.17%, 4.09%, 2.88%, and 3.82%.
    And when dealing with the large-scale dataset ImageNet1K, the accuracy of PDCNN-MRW
    is 3.27%, 6.62%, 3.45%, 4.65%, 7.13%, 5.85% and 6.74% higher than the recent algorithms
    and traditional models. The main reasons for the above results include three aspects.
    First, when dealing with small-scale datasets, the algorithms can rely on the
    properties of CNNs to maintain a high classification accuracy, which leads to
    a small gap between them. Secondly, as dealing with large-scale datasets, the
    FS-CSNMI and PWC-MR strategies proposed in PDCNN-MRW effectively reduce the interference
    of a large number of redundant features on the classification results and improve
    the performance of convolutional operations, which makes the algorithms’ classification
    accuracy to be better. Finally, as a comparison, the traditional models CNN-LSTM,
    CNN-GRU and CNN-BILSTM extend the structure of the CNN model, but they increase
    the extra parameter overhead of the model and fail to filter the redundant features,
    which makes them perform poorly when dealing with large-scale datasets. Therefore,
    PDCNN-MRW is more suitable for classifying image datasets in a big data environment.
    3. Speed-up ratio To analyze the acceleration performance of PDCNN-MRW, it is
    compared with the recent algorithms in four different datasets, and the speed-up
    ratio is used as a comparison metric. The speed-up ratio [31] represents the runtime
    ratio that the same task cost in serial and parallel systems. It can be used to
    measure the performance of parallel algorithms and is defined as follows. $$\\begin{aligned}
    {S_p} = \\frac{{{T_1}}}{{{T_p}}} \\end{aligned}$$ (59) where p is the number of
    compute nodes, \\({T_1}\\) represents the algorithm’s execution time at one computed
    node, and \\({T_p}\\) represents the execution time of the algorithm at computer
    nodes. The larger the value of \\({S_p}\\), the higher the parallelization ability
    of the algorithm. Fig. 8 The speed-up ratio of recent algorithms on four datasets
    Full size image Fig. 9 The speed-up ratio of traditional models on four datasets
    Full size image From Fig. 8, it is noticed that the speed-up ratio of each algorithm
    follows an upward trend as the number of nodes increases. This is expected because
    the computing speed can be improved by increasing the number of nodes. Also, it
    can be seen that the speed-up ratio of the PDCNN-MRW algorithm is equal to or
    even less than other algorithms when the number of nodes is less than 4. For instance,
    when the number of nodes was set to 4 (as shown in Fig. 8b), the speed-up ratio
    of the PDCNN-MRW algorithm increased to 3.06, which is 0.16 less than SASTCNN
    and 0.05 less than PCNN-GAP. This is because when the number of cluster nodes
    is small, the strategies designed in PDCNN-MRW are unable to utilize their full
    performance, and the advantages achieved by parallel computing are smaller, resulting
    in a smaller improvement in the acceleration ratio. However, when the number of
    nodes is greater than 4, the acceleration ratio of PDCNN-MRW begins to outperform
    the other algorithms. For example, when the number of nodes is set to 8, the speedup
    ratio of PDCNN-MRW increases to 4.76, which is 0.36, 0.98, 0.72, and 0.51 higher
    than SASTCNN, NG-CNN, Parallel CNN-ELM, and PCNN-GAP, respectively.This is due
    to the fact that the proposed PWC-MR strategy in PDCNN-MRW uses parallel Winograd
    convolution for fast extraction of image features, which significantly improves
    the efficiency of convolutional operations. In addition, the proposed LB-MTTM
    strategy effectively balances the load among multiple nodes, reduces the communication
    time of nodes, and improves the utilization of cluster resources. Therefore, the
    acceleration ratio of PDCNN-MRW in training image data is better than the algorithms
    in recent years. To compare the speedup ratio of PDCNN-MRW more comprehensively,
    the speedup ratios of the traditional models CNN-LSTM, CNN-GRU, and CNN-BILSTM
    taken in the parallel framework MapReduce are taken as the basis. From the four
    result plots in Fig. 9, it can be seen that the speedup ratio of PDCNN-MRW far
    exceeds that of these models. This gap becomes more pronounced when the number
    of nodes and the size of the dataset are larger. For example, when using an 8-node
    cluster to process the ImageNet1K dataset (as shown in Fig. 9d), the speedup ratios
    of PDCNN-MRW are larger than those of the three models by 1.94, 1.57, and 1.45,
    respectively. The reason for this result is that the traditional model only improves
    the CNN structure and fails to improve the feature extraction of large-scale data,
    resulting in lower efficiency. In addition, the failure to design relevant strategies
    to adapt the parallel framework is also one of the reasons for its relatively
    small acceleration. Therefore, compared with these three models, PDCNN-MRW makes
    good use of the parallel framework and the fast convolution strategy to improve
    the data processing capability, which brings a higher speedup ratio. 5 Conclusion
    In this paper, we have suggested a parallel DCNN algorithm called PDCNN-MRW, which
    is used to overcome the shortcomings of the traditional algorithms. The PDCNN-MRW
    consists of three steps: batch training, updating parameters in parallel, and
    merging parameters in parallel. At first, the FS-CSNMI strategy is presented to
    eliminate the redundant features in batch training, effectively avoiding the excessive
    calculation of redundant features. Next, a PWC-MR strategy combined with MapReduce
    is proposed to improve the performance of convolution operation during the phase
    of updating parameters in parallel. Finally, to balance the load among the task
    nodes, an LB-MTTM method is presented, which reduces the average response time
    of the cluster and improves the efficiency of merging parameters in parallel.
    The extensive experiments on multiple datasets have shown that our algorithm significantly
    outperforms the other compared algorithms in terms of running time, accuracy,
    and speed-up ratio. In the future, we will work on improving the problem of the
    FS-CSNMI strategy. For instance, the proportion of feature separation is unreasonable,
    the effectiveness of feature filtering is not apparent, and the efficiency of
    feature fusion is not ideal. We will also try to optimize the PWC-MR strategy
    further so that it can be fully adapted to convolutional operations with a large
    dataset. In addition, more advanced gradient descent methods can be used to reduce
    the number of training batches. Since our algorithm is executed in a distributed
    framework, the number of training batches can also be reduced by distributing
    the dataset to more nodes for processing. Data availability The data that support

    Predictive Control (MPC) has recently gained increasing interest in the adaptive
    management of water resources systems due to its capability of incorporating disturbance
    forecasts into real-time optimal control problems. Yet, related literature is
    scattered with heterogeneous applications, case-specific problem settings, and
    results that are hardly generalized and transferable across systems. Here, we
    systematically review 149 peer-reviewed journal articles published over the last
    25 years on MPC applied to water reservoirs, open channels, and urban water networks
    to identify common trends and open challenges in research and practice. The three
    water systems we consider are inter-connected, multi-purpose and multi-scale dynamical
    systems affected by multiple hydro-climatic uncertainties and evolving socioeconomic
    factors. Our review first identifies four main challenges currently limiting most
    MPC applications in the water domain: (i) lack of systematic benchmarking of MPC
    with respect to other control methods; (ii) lack of assessment of the impact of
    uncertainties on the model-based control; (iii) limited analysis of the impact
    of diverse forecast types, resolutions, and prediction horizons; (iv) under-consideration
    of the multi-objective nature of most water resources systems. We then argue that
    future MPC applications in water resources systems should focus on addressing
    these four challenges as key priorities for future developments. Previous article

    Adaptive water resources management is a priority for resilient development and
    adaptation to increasing hydro-climatic variability and socio-economic transformations
    (Brears, 2018, Şen, 2021, Stevenson et al., 2022, Zhao and Boll, 2022). Global
    physical and socio-economic changes add pressure on governments and policy-makers
    to urgently address water-related multi-sector challenges including energy and
    food security, human and environmental health, economic development, and climate
    change mitigation and adaptation (e.g., Global Water Partnership - GWP, 2021,
    Miralles-Wilhelm, 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022). To address these challenges,
    improve the sustainability and efficiency of water resources management, and adapt
    to transformative changes, new opportunities may come from adaptive control techniques
    and hydro-meteorological forecasts (Abioye et al., 2020, Bwambale et al., 2022,
    Coelho and Andrade-Campos, 2014, Şen, 2021, Ding et al., 2018, Dobson et al.,
    2019, Giuliani et al., 2021, Wu, Maier, Dandy, Arora, and Castelletti, 2020, Yuan
    et al., 2019). Control methods and tools have been used in the water management
    community to design optimal water resources operations for several decades already,
    since the 1955 Harvard Water Program (see (Reuss, 2003) for a historical perspective,
    the pioneering work by Maass et al. (1962) and the reviews in Castelletti et al.,
    2008b, Coelho and Andrade-Campos, 2014, Creaco et al., 2019, García et al., 2015,
    Labadie, 2004, Macian-Sorribes and Pulido-Velazquez, 2020, Malaterre, 1995, Malaterre
    et al., 1998, Mareels et al., 2005, Van Der Werf et al., 2022, Yeh, 1985). Yet,
    this is still a very active research field, as water systems are uncertain dynamic
    systems with challenging features that make the use of optimal control tools particularly
    complex. First, water systems’ disturbances and related risks are ever-changing,
    as the variability induced by changing hydro-climatic conditions has been expanding
    in recent decades (e.g., Hall et al., 2014, Sreeparvathy and Srinivas, 2022),
    alongside the frequency and intensity of extreme events that are being exacerbated
    with climate change (Gründemann et al., 2022, IPCC, 2021, Stevenson et al., 2022,
    Trenberth et al., 2014). Second, human pressure on water resources has been augmenting
    with population and socio-economic growth, leading to increased water and energy
    demands at the global scale (e.g., Boretti and Rosa, 2019, van Ruijven et al.,
    2019, Wu, Maier, Dandy, Arora, and Castelletti, 2020). This, in turn, has shifted
    decision makers’ preferences and risk perception (e.g., Giuliani et al., 2021,
    Poff et al., 2016). Third, water systems usually serve multiple stakeholders with
    often conflicting and time-evolving objectives (Soncini-Sessa, Castelletti, &
    Weber, 2007), which makes the exploration of trade-offs essential (e.g., Reed,
    Hadka, Herman, Kasprzyk, & Kollat, 2013). The advantages of using real-time adaptive
    model-based control techniques are evident in the context of hydro-climatic and
    socio-economic changes, as the use of forecasts unlocks the control potential
    to anticipate and, therefore, adapt to changes in the system’s characteristics
    and disturbances. These approaches can be grouped under the umbrella of Model
    Predictive Control (MPC) (Bertsekas, 2005, Scattolini, 2009), which is a popular
    approach, mostly well-established for industrial applications (e.g., Forbes et
    al., 2015, Qin and Badgwell, 2000, Schwenzer et al., 2021) yet attracting increasing
    attention from the water systems community (e.g., Giuliani et al., 2021) due to
    recent advances in monitoring and forecasting systems and increasing computational
    capabilities (e.g., Wu, Emerton et al., 2020). Hydro-meteorological forecasts
    have constantly been improving in quality and accessibility over the last few
    decades (e.g., Buizza, 2019, Wu, Emerton et al., 2020). Similarly, hydrological
    and water systems’ models have been substantially refined in recent years, allowing
    both the representation of physical processes at the highest resolution (e.g.,
    Bierkens et al., 2015, Nair et al., 2020) and the efficient emulation of high-fidelity
    models via surrogate models based on machine learning techniques (e.g., Huang
    et al., 2021, Miro et al., 2021, Wu et al., 2014). Today, it is possible to assimilate
    earth observations and operational forecasts in real-time and run optimization
    and simulation models within a reasonable time thanks to recent technological
    advances (Baardman et al., 2022, Blair et al., 2019, Camporese and Girotto, 2022,
    Creaco et al., 2019). In this context, we believe that a review of MPC applications
    to water management problems is timely and important to stimulate reflections
    on MPC benefits and challenges in the water sector and set the path for further
    research and practice developments. While previous reviews focused on discussing
    the use of different optimal control methods in specific water systems (e.g.,
    water reservoirs), here we contribute a comprehensive analysis of the most recent
    advancements in MPC for different types of water systems. The heterogeneous features
    of these systems introduce distinct challenges to optimal control techniques and
    often require diverse MPC approaches. In this review, we focus on three key types
    of interconnected water systems designed and operated to store, convey, and distribute
    water for human and environmental needs as well as to manage sewer and drainage
    flow at the basin to urban scales: water reservoirs, open channels, and urban
    water networks. To build our comprehensive review of 149 peer-reviewed journal
    articles, we follow an automatic search procedure and then refine the paper selection
    using a set of eligibility criteria, as detailed in the Methods. The Methods section
    first recalls the MPC methods used for water systems’ operations. Then, the three
    types of water systems within the scope of this review are introduced, explaining
    why these systems are relevant and detailing the models used in the MPC applications.
    The Results Section then provides a detailed summary of the reviewed papers across
    the three types of water systems. Finally, the Discussion and Conclusions Sections
    summarize the limitations and merits of the applications reviewed and highlight
    the most urgent needs for future developments. 2. Methods 2.1. Model predictive
    control Model Predictive Control is a control strategy based on the sequential,
    online resolution of multiple open-loop control problems defined over a finite,
    receding time horizon (Bertsekas, 2005). At each time step, the resolution of
    an MPC problem yields a sequence of optimal control actions (i.e., the releases
    for reservoirs, gate openings for channels, etc.) over the future horizon , given
    a predicted trajectory of the disturbances over the same horizon. The optimization
    is generally formulated considering a single objective; when the problem involves
    multiple objectives (e.g., water supply, hydropower production, flood control,
    environmental protection, irrigation, transport, etc.), these are generally aggregated
    using a scalarization function (e.g., weighted combination) or via the lexicographic
    goal programming technique in cases where there is a clear hierarchy of priorities
    across the objectives (e.g., Horvath et al., 2022). The online optimization scheme
    is reiterated forward in time over a receding horizon during the operational life
    of the system. After each optimization, only the first control action of the optimized
    control sequence is actuated, before reiterating the optimization at the next
    time step. Through this reiteration of the model-based optimization, MPC determines
    the control law implicitly in a closed-loop form, as it computes the optimal control
    action at each time step based on the observed state of the system (x ). The current
    state of the system can be directly observed in most of the cases for the water
    systems considered in this review. A state estimator is needed otherwise. MPC
    requires a model of the system (see Section 2.2), also known as internal or prediction
    model, to predict the effect of control actions on the controlled system’s dynamics,
    and to determine the set of actions that yield the optimal performance with respect
    to the considered objectives subject to physical and operational constraints.
    The choice of the model plays a major role in the performance yielded by the MPC.
    The flexibility of the direct use of any models available for the systems to be
    controlled is one of the main advantages of this approach, particularly in terms
    of controlling highly non-linear systems. The requirement for computational efficiency
    is the main factor that can limit the use of fully physically-based models of
    large-scale complex water systems like urban water networks, for which reduced-order
    data-driven models can be developed to be used in MPC (see Section 3.3). The flexibility
    in working with (nonlinear) constraints is another advantage of MPC compared to
    other control methods. And this advantage is particularly relevant for water systems,
    as explicit physical constraints (with non-linearities), like limits of actuators,
    or legal constraints, like a minimum release from reservoirs, are often required.
    Another advantage of MPC with respect to other control approaches is the mitigation
    of the curse of ‘dimensionality’ (Bellman, 1957) that limits the applicability
    of Dynamic Programming family methods to large water systems because of the challenges
    associated with the computation of the value functions for increasing dimensions
    of state and control vectors. Moreover, the use of real-time information and probabilistic/ensemble
    forecasts in the optimization process allows MPC to adapt to evolving external
    conditions and mitigate the impacts of uncertain extreme events. Different configurations
    of MPC exist depending on how they handle the control of multiple actuators in
    large-scale systems (centralized, decentralized, or distributed MPC), the parameter
    estimation problem (adaptive or non-adaptive MPC), and the uncertainty in disturbance
    forecasts (deterministic or robust and stochastic MPC; see Sections 2.1.1 Deterministic
    MPC, 2.1.2 Robust and stochastic MPC). A centralized MPC configuration assumes
    that a single controller processes measurements from all sensors/gauges and determines
    optimal actions to be applied by all actuators. However, water systems are usually
    spread over large, often transboundary regions, and several water boards can be
    involved in their management. In such large systems, centralized management may
    become unfeasible or computationally cumbersome, and may also be undesirable with
    regard to system reliability, scalability, and responsiveness. Thus, multi-agent
    control, whereby the control effort is divided among local agents (also referred
    to as controllers), each in charge of part of the overall system, emerges as a
    possible way to circumvent the drawbacks arising from centralized implementations.
    Two main criteria by which to classify multi-agent control approaches are the
    existence of communication links and hierarchy among local controllers. On the
    one hand, an approach is said to be decentralized if interactions among local
    controllers are neglected, and distributed if communication links among local
    controllers are enabled for the sake of improved overall performance, although
    at the expense of increased computation times. On the other hand, an approach
    is said to be single-level if all local controllers are at the same hierarchical
    level, and multi-level if a subset of local controllers has ascendancy over the
    rest. Regarding the problem of reducing model uncertainties, in standard (non-adaptive)
    MPC, the model used for prediction is often assumed to be accurate and fixed in
    time, while only its state is updated. However, by using a fixed model parameterization
    the changing uncertainties within the system are not taken into account, which
    can reduce the MPC performance. In contrast, in adaptive MPC, the model parameters
    can be updated online by using available measurements, and the estimation problem
    is addressed by including a parameter estimation procedure as part of the control
    strategy. The control action is then calculated not only based on the estimated
    current state but also on the updated model, which can help reduce the dynamic
    model uncertainties affecting MPC (Lemos, Machado, Nogueira, Rato, & Rijo, 2009).
    2.1.1. Deterministic MPC In cases where a single deterministic prediction of the
    systems’ disturbances is available, the formulation of the (single-objective)
    MPC problem over the prediction horizon ( ), to be solved at each control time
    step, is as follows: (1) ɛ subject to: (2) ɛ (3) ɛ (4) ɛ (5) where: is the state
    of the system at time step (e.g., the reservoir storage, the water level in channels,
    and the state of other dynamical components); is the control vector including
    all control actions for the actuators (e.g., gates or pumps); ɛ is the deterministic
    forecast of the system’s disturbances provided by a prediction model for each
    time step over the prediction horizon ; is a time-separable cost function associated
    with the transition from time step to ; is a penalty function associated with
    the final state ( ) that represents the future costs beyond the prediction horizon.
    It should be noted that the control horizon, i.e. the time span for which the
    control inputs are allowed to vary, can be shorter than the prediction horizon,
    though often they are assumed to be equal as in Eq. (1). The optimal control problem
    (1) is subject to the dynamic constraints provided by the state transition function
    (Eq. (2)) along with different types of physical constraints (e.g., limits of
    actuators) and operational/legal ones (e.g., minimum environmental flows) that
    can be expressed as (non linear) inequality constraints (Eq. (3)). 2.1.2. Robust
    and stochastic MPC One of the limitations of Problem (1) is that it requires the
    availability of the sequence of future system disturbances ɛ , which is unrealistic
    to expect to be perfect in many practical situations. To deal with this issue,
    the MPC framework includes strategies that handle uncertainties in a robust manner
    via worst-case formulations, e.g., min–max and robust MPC. While these methods
    guarantee the satisfaction of the problem constraints as long as some assumptions
    are satisfied (mainly, that disturbances are bounded), they also generally lead
    to very conservative control policies because a worst-case scenario approach is
    followed. To remedy this situation, stochastic MPC approaches exploit the characterization
    of the forecasted uncertainties, to obtain a trade-off between closed-loop constraint
    satisfaction and performance. Stochastic MPC approaches typically employ so-called
    chance constraints, i.e., constraints that should be satisfied with a predefined
    probability level (Mesbah, 2016). Thus, occasional violations of the constraints
    might occur, but system performance will be increased during normal system operation
    because the controller will be allowed to work closer to the constraints in comparison
    to worst-case approaches. Here, we propose a classification of existing robust
    and stochastic MPC approaches used in the water systems literature so far into
    two categories, based on the way the knowledge of the probability distribution
    function (pdf) of the disturbances is implemented into the optimization problem:
    (i) explicit robust and stochastic approaches, that use the explicit information
    on the pdf, and (ii) implicit approaches, that rely on a set of scenarios (or
    ensemble forecasts) which encode information about the disturbance evolution and
    its uncertainty in an implicit manner. (i) Explicit approaches, require an explicit
    (probabilistic) characterization of the disturbance behaviour. A classical strategy
    to deal with uncertainty explicitly is the use of Open-loop feedback control (OLFC),
    as introduced by Bertsekas (1976). This approach presents the future disturbances
    according to their probability distribution and computes the objectives through
    a function to filter the disturbances (e.g., expected value). The OLFC performance
    can be improved by adopting a partial open-loop feedback control (POLFC) formulation
    (e.g., Castelletti et al., 2008a, Pianosi and Soncini-Sessa, 2009), which explicitly
    assumes that in the future the state of the system will be measured and a new
    problem will be reformulated. The POLFC problem, therefore, computes at each time
    step the optimal release decision for the first time step reflecting first-step
    uncertainty and the optimal operating policy for the following time steps. (ii)
    Implicit approaches rely on the use of a set of scenarios of the disturbances.
    The set of scenarios can be either built using data from previous realizations
    or using real-time probabilistic forecasts. A classical implicit approach that
    uses scenarios in MPC is the Scenario-based MPC which allows optimizing the system
    behaviour for several disturbance realizations. This approach has been generalized
    in Calafiore and Campi, 2006, Calafiore and Fagiano, 2013a, Calafiore and Fagiano,
    2013b, and has been applied to water systems in Tian et al., 2019, Tian, Negenborn
    et al., 2017b, van Overloop et al., 2008, Velarde et al., 2019. An interesting
    feature of this approach is that multiple models can be considered, thus allowing
    to consider model uncertainty in addition to disturbance uncertainty. The scenario-based
    MPC approach can be extended via the Tree-based MPC (TB-MPC) formulation to provide
    the controller with enhanced closed-loop control capabilities so that it can adapt
    to future events, as uncertainty is resolved via bifurcation points along the
    prediction horizon, as first applied to water systems in Raso, Schwanenberg, van
    de Giesen, and van Overloop (2014). Implicit approaches are particularly relevant
    for water systems as the forecasts are often provided in the form of an ensemble
    of multiple time series, usually generated by running the forecast model multiple
    times with perturbed initial conditions or using multiple models. Given their
    capacity to account for the inherent forecast uncertainty, ensemble forecasts
    have become a standard in hydro-meteorological forecasting (Buizza, 2019, Gneiting
    and Raftery, 2005, Zhao et al., 2021). This ensemble is then transformed into
    a tree where similar ensemble members are bundled together into one trajectory
    (branch) up to the point when some of them start to significantly diverge from
    the others. The tree structure is then used to optimize a control tree defining
    a distinct control sequence for each branch. Control sequences are constrained
    to be the same up to the time when two ensemble members diverge. Examples of applications
    of TB-MPC can be found in Ficchi et al., 2016, Maestre et al., 2013, Raso et al.,
    2014, Uysal, Alvarado-Montero et al., 2018a. Explicit knowledge about the disturbance
    (pdf) might be available and can used to build a set of scenarios for implicit
    approaches, such as multi-scenario MPC or TB-MPC, so as to achieve approximate
    robust MPC strategies (Lucia, Finkler, & Engell, 2013). Alternatively, one may
    proceed the other way around, by using historical data (e.g., previous realizations
    of the disturbances or reforecasts) to generate an explicit model (possibly with
    some limitations) and use that in explicit stochastic approaches. Finally, stochastic
    approaches can be considered robust as well if very strict requirements are imposed
    regarding the probability of closed-loop constraint violation. As the imposed
    probability of constraint violation tends to zero, the controller becomes more
    and more robust as it needs to increase the safety margin with respect to the
    problem constraints. For this reason, there are some articles in the literature
    that present stochastic approaches from a robustness viewpoint (Chen et al., 2021,
    Chen and You, 2021, Shang et al., 2020). 2.2. Models for water systems applications
    This section provides an overview of the models used for representing the different
    water systems considered in this review, namely water reservoirs, open channels,
    and urban water networks. It is worth mentioning that despite we illustrate and
    discuss these systems separately, they are often interconnected with water reservoirs
    feeding either open channels and/or urban water networks. 2.2.1. Water reservoirs
    A water reservoir is a regulated storage or lake, controlled by a dam that either
    blocks the flow of a watercourse that is drained from upstream catchments (in-stream
    reservoir) or creates a retention basin collecting water supplied by an adjoining
    stream, a canal, pipeline or aqueduct (off-stream). Reservoirs can be part of
    networks of different levels of complexity, with two or more reservoirs in parallel
    or in series (see Fig. 1 for a schematic representation), connected with water
    users via natural or artificial canals. Reservoirs are usually multi-purpose systems,
    serving power plants, irrigation districts, urban and industrial water users,
    as well as contributing to other targets like flood control, environmental management,
    navigation, water quality, etc. Traditionally, reservoir control is implemented
    by a human operator that can act based on static rule curves or control actions
    suggested by a Decision Support System (DSS) in real-time. Since the control time
    step is discrete, the model for a reservoir is typically written in time-discrete
    form too, even though the physical processes involved in the system are time-continuous.
    The control time step varies based on the type of systems and objectives, with
    control frequencies typically ranging from hourly or daily for smaller systems
    and for flood control or hydropower generation, to monthly for large systems and
    for water supply objectives. The generic model for a system of reservoirs is based
    on the mass-balance equation describing the dynamics of the water storage at each
    reservoir as: (6) where: is the state of reservoir at time step , i.e., the reservoir
    storage; is the net inflow volume (i.e., inflow and direct precipitation minus
    evaporation and seepage losses) from time step to ; is the actual release from
    the reservoir in the same time interval. In the notation in Eq. (6), the time
    subscript of each variable indicates the time instant when the value is deterministically
    known. The reservoir storage is measured at time step and thus is denoted as ,
    while the net inflow and the actual release are denoted as and , respectively
    because they can be known only at the end of the time interval. For multi-reservoir
    systems, the global model is obtained by aggregating the models of the reservoirs
    that compose it, i.e., all the variables in Eq. (6) become vectors (e.g., x ,
    q ) and the network topology can be represented by an incidence matrix (Giuliani
    et al., 2021). Download : Download high-res image (222KB) Download : Download

    Adapted from the Zambezi river system’s scheme reported in Giuliani and Castelletti
    (2013). The actual release is a function of the control variable (i.e., the release
    decision at time step ), of the storage and of the net inflow : (7) where the
    function is called the release function and it is a nonlinear function, which
    binds the actual release within a range of physical acceptability. The range is
    defined by the minimum and maximum releases that would occur from time step to
    by keeping all the sluice gates completely closed and open, respectively (Castelletti
    et al., 2008b). Thus, the release function allows for the inclusion of physical
    constraints on reservoir storage and release into the model. The actual release
    may differ from the control decision when the available water is not sufficient
    to realize the decision or when a spill takes place. The release function is inherently
    stochastic because between the time step at which the release decision is taken
    and the time step at which the control action is completed, the uncertain net
    inflow affects the reservoir storage. The net inflow is an aggregation of several
    hydro-meteorological contributions including upstream and lateral flows from tributaries
    and runoff, direct precipitation over the reservoir minus evaporation and infiltration
    losses. The net inflow is often modelled as a system disturbance (i.e., ɛ ), aggregating
    multiple sources of uncertainty, though its contributions can also be separately
    modelled as distinct disturbances. On the other hand, the hydrologic processes
    contributing to the net inflow can be represented using dynamic hydrological models
    of different types, from conceptual to physically-based, lumped or spatially distributed,
    deterministic or stochastic models. Data-driven alternatives or simple statistical
    models are often preferred because of their computational efficiency (e.g., Wang,
    Chau, Cheng, & Qiu, 2009) and, recently, efforts are being made to move towards
    hybrid models (a combination of pure data-driven and process-based models) that
    can be more interpretable by users (e.g., Chakraborty, Başağaoğlu, & Winterle,
    2021). These models can be used to provide a set of deterministic or stochastic
    forecasts of the disturbance, that can be issued before every control time step
    and used in an optimal control problem. 2.2.2. Open channels Open-channel systems
    are large-scale networked systems that consist of natural rivers and artificial
    canals and serve multiple purposes. As part of the integrated urban water management
    cycle, open-channel systems can be used to convey treated water to consumer areas,
    which may then be supplied to consumers (using pressurized pipeline networks)
    or used for irrigation purposes. Open-channel systems can also be employed for
    freight and passenger transportation, provided that water depth and width are
    sufficient. Moreover, the watercourse should not be interrupted too frequently
    by elements that must be avoided, e.g., reefs, rocks and sandbanks, and bridges
    should have sufficient clearance. Although not strictly in the scope of this paper,
    it is interesting to note that research on inland waterborne transport is attracting
    increasing attention, as it is one of the most environmentally friendly and cost-effective
    transport modes. A schematic representation of an open-channel system is given
    in Fig. 2, which shows its main constitutive elements. On the one hand, canals
    are stretches of the watercourse bounded between two control structures. On the
    other hand, actuators are hydraulic infrastructure, e.g., gates, weirs and dams,
    available for water control purposes (see examples above). Finally, nodes represent
    canal junctions, i.e., locations wherein a stream flows into or branches off from
    the main stream (these are known as tributary and distributary, respectively).
    Open-channel dynamics are most accurately described by the Saint-Venant equations,
    a set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations that can be formulated
    as follows (Litrico & Fromion, 2009): (8a) (8b) Eqs. (8a), (8b) represent the
    mass and momentum conservation equations, respectively, the latter comprising
    inertia, advection, gravitational force and friction force terms. Moreover, is
    the longitudinal abscissa (continuous independent variable), is the time (continuous
    variable), is the wetted area [m ], is the discharge [m /s] across section , is
    the average velocity [m/s] in section , is the water depth [m], is the friction
    slope [m/m], is the bed slope [m/m] and is the gravitational acceleration [m/s
    ]. Download : Download high-res image (243KB) Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 2. Schematic representation of an open-channel system. Eq. (8) must be completed
    with initial and boundary conditions. On the one hand, the initial condition is
    given in terms of , for all , where is the length of the canal. On the other hand,
    boundary conditions must be chosen depending on flow characteristics: subcritical
    flow requires an upstream and a downstream condition; supercritical flow requires
    two upstream conditions; and intermediate situations require to specify one, two,
    or three conditions, depending on the situation (Litrico & Fromion, 2009). Furthermore,
    available measurements and controls must be specified. It is typically the case
    in practical situations that available measurements and controls are boundary
    water levels and gate openings, respectively (Litrico & Fromion, 2009). Because
    of their accuracy, the Saint-Venant equations constitute the basis of state-of-the-art
    simulation software, e.g., SOBEK1 and SIĈ2.2 However, they are demanding in terms
    of computational resources and provide too much information for applications such
    as controlling average water levels, two facts that render their direct use impractical
    for control purposes (hence the variables in (8) are not directly connected with
    the notation introduced in Fig. 2). For this reason, the use of alternative and
    simpler models as prediction models (i.e., internal MPC models) is commonly encountered
    in the literature. These simplified models generally compensate the loss of precision
    with a significant reduction of the computational burden, which in turn allows
    to use more elaborated formulations within the MPC framework. Several classes
    of simplified models have been developed: • Some models are obtained directly
    from the Saint-Venant equations, discretizing the system in space (e.g., using
    a staggered grid) and linearizing. The kind of discretization method employed
    plays a crucial role in the stability of the obtained model. On the one hand,
    certain time-implicit methods yield stable models regardless of the step size
    chosen, even for nonlinear hyperbolic systems (Hirsch, 2007). On the other hand,
    the stability of explicit discretization methods depends on the discretization
    step size (Conde, Quijano, & Ocampo-Martinez, 2021). • Other models are based
    on strong mechanistic simplifications of the behaviour of the canal dynamics:
    – One of the first proposals was the Integrator Delay (ID) model (Schuurmans et
    al., 1995, Schuurmans et al., 1999), an approximation model for flow in an open
    channel with a backwater effect. The integrator term captures the canal volume
    change according to the water level variation, and the time delay indicates the
    required time for a disturbance generated at one end of the canal to have an effect
    at the other end. It is worth noting that some authors simplify the ID model even
    further, considering only the integrator term (I), thus assuming that the canal
    behaves like a reservoir. – A modification to the ID model was proposed by Litrico
    and Fromion (2004) to represent the high-frequency phenomena and thus describe
    a canal in any flow condition. This new model, which features a zero in the transfer
    function to represent the direct influence of the discharge on the water level
    in high frequencies, is known as the Integrator Delay Zero (IDZ) model. – The
    Integrator Resonance (IR) model was proposed by van Overloop, Miltenburg et al.
    (2010), to characterize the effect of reflecting waves on the water levels, which
    dominate the behaviour of the short and deep open-channel flow. • System identification
    techniques have also been employed for the purpose of open-channel modelling.
    In particular, black-box models, which do not make use of any physical insight,
    have proven to perform well (Rivas-Pérez et al., 2014, Weyer, 2001). The common
    feature shared by the different simplified models is the connection between discharges
    and water levels. However, some of these models are formulated using continuous
    time input–output representations (e.g., ID, IDZ and IR), and must be discretized
    for implementation purposes. On the other hand, models with full space–time discretization
    are directly described in discrete-time state–space form. With some minor adjustments,
    all these models can be framed within the more general control-oriented model
    given below: (9a) (9b) The variables used in Eq. (9) follow the notation introduced
    in Fig. 2, and their meaning is as follows: the vector of states contains the
    water levels (and possibly other terms, depending on the simplified model that
    is employed), denotes the vector of control inputs (e.g., actuator flow or position
    setpoints; for an exhaustive list of control variables see Section 3.2), represents
    the vector of uncontrollable flows due to environmental phenomena (e.g., rainfall,
    infiltration and percolation), and is the vector of water demands (e.g., off-takes
    by farmers) that act as system disturbances ɛ . Note that (9) includes differential
    and algebraic equations: the former represent the system dynamics, and the latter
    account for the mass balances that must hold at the nodes. 2.2.3. Urban water
    networks The integrated urban water cycle is composed of several infrastructural
    and operational components, including water sources management, water treatment,
    water transport and distribution, sewer/wastewater collection, and rainwater/stormwater
    drainage systems (Loucks & Van Beek, 2017), which have the main goal of providing
    water for human needs reliably, efficiently, and safely, and then returning it
    to the environment with the lowest possible impact (Walski et al., 2003). The
    problem of optimal operation of large-scale urban water networks has been extensively
    investigated in the literature in the last 50 years (Mala-Jetmarova, Sultanova,
    & Savic, 2017), with the main focus on water transport and distribution networks
    and optimal management of sewer and drainage infrastructure, beside smaller-scale
    applications that focus on solving local optimization problems of individual network
    components, such as individual pumps/pumping stations and water treatment processes
    in water/wastewater treatment plants. Taking water transport and distribution
    networks for instance (see Fig. 3 for a schematic representation), an optimal
    control problem is typically formulated as an optimal pump operation and valve
    setting control problem targeting resources and economic savings in energy use
    and related cost, while ensuring that water is conveyed to final users to satisfy
    their water demands. Modelling a water distribution network requires modelling
    its main components, which can be classified into nodes – which include demand
    junctions (where water leaves or enters the network), reservoirs (water sources),
    and tanks (where water is stored) – and links — which include pipes connecting
    different nodes and valves and pumps. Valves and pumps are the actuators in the
    system to be controlled. Accounting for all aforementioned system components,
    a control-oriented model of a water distribution network can be formulated as
    in Wang, Puig, and Cembrano (2017): (10a) (10b) where the dynamic states in vector
    are the water storage levels (heads) of the network tanks at time step , the algebraic
    states in vector are the hydraulic heads in all other nodes of the network, resulting
    from flow balance, is the vector of control inputs (pump operations and valve
    status), and is the vector of non-controllable flows through pipes. is the vector
    of water demand intended as system disturbances ɛ . Pump and valves might vary
    in type and size. For instance, pumps might be with fixed-speed or variable-speed
    drives, valves might be pressure modulating or pressure reducing valves, non-return
    valves, head control, etc., which should be accounted for in modelling such components,
    as their characteristics also constrain the type and range of available controls.

    Fig. 3. Schematic representation of a water distribution network. Adapted from
    the Epanet 2: user manual (Rossman et al., 2000). The above discrete-time model
    includes difference and algebraic equations, based on mass and energy conservation.
    The mass balance should be guaranteed at the network nodes, implying that the
    flow rate of water in node from all its connected pipes is balanced by the actual
    demand in that node in each time step (Rossman et al., 2000): (11) Energy conservation
    is formulated to satisfy the Bernoulli’s principle, while head losses in pipes
    are accounted for via the Hazen–Williams equation. Once the above model is formulated
    for a given water distribution network, the system can be simulated either in
    demand-driven mode, which, under normal conditions, assumes that the pressure
    in the system depends on node demands and, thus, the mass balance and head loss
    equations are solved assuming that node demands are known and satisfied, or in
    pressure-driven mode, which assumes that the delivered demand depends on the available
    pressure in the system and accounts for possible demand shortages. In emergency/anomaly
    situations (e.g., firefighting, power outages, pipe leaks), consumers do not always
    receive their requested demand in a pressure-driven scenario. Several state-of-the-art
    software tools are available to model water distribution networks of various scales.
    Arguably, the most widely used among them is EPANET, developed as open-source
    software by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (Rossman et al.,
    2000). EPANET can perform also water quality simulation beside hydraulic simulations,
    thus allowing for coupled hydraulic and water quality simulation, which increases
    the size of the problem formulated in Eqs. (10) by adding states related to water
    quality parameters, along with the possibility of controlling their concentrations
    (e.g., via chlorine dosage). Yet, EPANET model implementations are not straightforward
    as control-oriented models, since they often include several switches and discrete
    operation conditions that make them not suitable for the direct application of
    gradient-based optimization approaches. Alternative software tools exist to model
    other networks of the urban water cycle such as combined and sanitary sewers and
    other drainage systems, e.g., the US-EPA Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) (Rossman
    et al., 2010). A broad formulation of the system model as indicated in Eq. (10)
    and overall modelling strategy still stands, with water flows being ruled by mass
    and energy conservation laws. However, individual system components to be modelled
    change, with disturbances to be forecasted being most typically rainfall and inflow
    to the system, and controls being basin outflows, gate settings, and, more on
    an infrastructure planning perspective, Low-Impact Development (LID) controls.
    Complementary tools such as the one reported in Riaño-Briceño, Barreiro-Gomez,
    Ramirez-Jaime, Quijano, and Ocampo-Martinez (2016) allow the use of SWMM to design
    control strategies, in particular, applied to drainage systems, with some flexibility
    and considering dynamical models and a more realistic setup including disturbances
    and their forecast models. In some cases, e.g., for large-scale urban water networks,
    it is useful to replace the full model of the system with a reduced model of the
    network that can offer higher computational efficiency (Shamir & Salomons, 2008).
    This is usually done via skeletonization by reducing the number of components
    of the system (e.g., by removing irrelevant pipes and nodes) while retaining a
    high level of similarity between the reduced and full model outputs and performance.
    Alternative approaches instead rely on the development of data-driven surrogate
    models. 2.3. Literature search and classification methods This section describes
    the search methods, keywords and criteria followed for the bibliographic search
    highlighting common points and workflows across water systems, as well as differences
    (e.g., keywords, etc.). Real-time control techniques applied to water systems
    take sometimes different names but can be reduced to an MPC-like approach as long
    as they embed the three main blocks of MPC (see Introduction): (i) the internal
    model of the system, used to simulate the effects of the control actions on the
    system, (ii) the use of forecasts available in real-time, either real, synthetic
    or ‘perfect’ forecasts and (iii) an online optimization that is reiterated over
    a receding horizon. In the water systems’ literature, several studies have adopted
    an MPC-like technique either referring to it with different wordings, like ‘rolling
    horizon control’, ‘receding horizon control’, ‘real-time optimization’, or proposing
    some theoretical modifications to the MPC approach and providing an alternative
    name (e.g., Partial Open-loop Feedback Control). To account for such alternative
    wordings for “Model Predictive Control” and domain-specific differences, we formulated
    customized versions of the literature search string for each of the three water
    system types considered and used them to identify relevant papers in the Web of
    Science platform.3 The resulting search strings are the following: • For water
    reservoirs: (optimal AND water AND reservoir* AND (operation OR control OR management)
    AND (predictive control OR forecast-based OR receding horizon OR rolling horizon
    OR receding-horizon OR rolling-horizon)) • For water channels: (Model predictive
    control OR MPC OR receding horizon OR rolling horizon) AND (water canal* OR water
    channel* OR irrigation OR inland OR inland waterway*) • For urban water networks:
    (optimal AND water AND (drinking OR distribution OR transport OR wastewater OR
    drainage OR grey water OR sewer OR sewage) AND (networks OR systems) AND (operation
    OR control OR management) AND (model predictive control OR predict* control OR
    naive feedback control OR receding horizon OR rolling horizon OR receding-horizon
    OR rolling-horizon)) The search queries are not restricted to the word ‘Model
    Predictive Control’, so the records found include some irrelevant studies. Exclusion
    criteria only regarded (i) article language (only papers written in English were
    considered) and (ii) and article type (only peer-reviewed publications in scientific
    journals were considered). Conference papers were excluded to avoid redundancies
    since some conference publications often present preliminary versions of studies
    subsequently published in full journal papers. We acknowledge that some of the
    most recent advanced developments, that might be present in a few recent peer-reviewed
    conference publications, may not have been covered in this review, but overall
    we do not expect that it would have a significant impact on the identified trends
    and challenges, given the large sample of journal articles included. Manual filtering
    on the resulting records was performed based on paper title and abstract, to discard
    items that were out of scope for this review (i.e., not focusing on MPC or not
    applying it to the water systems of interest), before evaluating the eligibility
    of a restricted set of papers based on their full-text assessment. A smaller set
    of additional relevant papers not retrieved with the search query (7 items) was
    added to the final database from other sources, namely from references in previous
    review papers resulting from the search (see Fig. 4 for details on the sample
    selection). 3. Review results 3.1. MPC for water reservoirs In the last 15 years,
    several studies analysed the potential of forecast-based real-time control techniques
    for water reservoir systems across different real-world problems by leveraging
    the increasing availability and improved quality of hydro-meteorological forecasts.
    The query formulated to retrieve peer-reviewed journal articles on MPC for water
    reservoir systems (see Section 2.3) returned an initial set of 105 papers. After
    screening these manuscripts, we retained 33 publications and added 7 more documents
    (from references in previous reviews on optimal control of reservoirs that were
    found by the query), yielding a total of 40 articles that have been analysed in
    detail (see PRISMA diagram in Fig. 4). As recently highlighted in Giuliani et
    al. (2021), our review confirms that MPC approaches (and analogous approaches
    that could be reduced to MPC) have been applied more commonly only in recent years,
    with the 40 studies reviewed here that have been published from 2008 to 2022 (see
    the temporal distribution in Fig. 5). Download : Download high-res image (586KB)

    1 (Marinaki et al. (1999)) 25 Almost all reviewed papers implement a centralized
    control architecture to determine the optimal releases from one or more reservoirs,
    with only a few applications also dealing with the control of pumps (e.g., Galelli
    et al., 2014, Javan Salehi and Shourian, 2021). Most studies implement a daily
    controller (e.g., Anghileri et al., 2016, Fan et al., 2016, Wan et al., 2016),
    but we found applications working at either sub-hourly (e.g., Breckpot et al.,
    2013, Lin et al., 2020) or hourly (e.g., Delgoda et al., 2013, Karimanzira et
    al., 2016, Lin et al., 2018, Romanowicz et al., 2010, Xu et al., 2020, Zmijewski
    et al., 2016) or up to monthly (e.g., Cuvelier et al., 2018, Kistenmacher and
    Georgakakos, 2015, Zambelli et al., 2011) frequencies. Suppose the forecast frequency
    is not sufficient to timely inform the control action. In that case, the MPC results
    should be seen as a recommendation provided by a decision support system that
    the operator can adjust, potentially taking into account local expert knowledge
    and any operating factors that the MPC optimization could not cover (e.g., Roetz
    & Theobald, 2019). In almost all the reviewed studies (see Table 1), the forecast
    represents the inflow to the reservoir, which is usually generated using a hydrological
    model fed by meteorological forecasts and any other significant information available
    at each control time step (e.g., snowpack and hydrological conditions, including
    the streamflow upstream, being routed using the model). Only two studies (Galelli
    et al., 2015, Galelli et al., 2014) complement the inflow with tide forecasts.
    Moreover, many studies (more than half) use a deterministic forecast and MPC formulation
    (e.g., Anand et al., 2013, Galelli et al., 2015, Giuliani and Castelletti, 2013),
    although the adoption of stochastic formulations is increasing in the last few
    years (e.g., Ahmad and Hussain, 2019, Sahu and McLaughlin, 2018, Uysal, Schwanenberg
    et al., 2018b). These stochastic approaches (see Section 2.1.2 and Table 2) allow
    the explicit probabilistic characterization of the forecast uncertainty by relying
    on ensemble forecasts and, therefore, better hedge against risk (Breckpot et al.,
    2013). The reviewed papers used a wide range of control time steps (see Table
    3) and of forecast horizons (also called lead times in the forecasting literature)
    ranging from a few hours for responding to rapid events such as floods (e.g.,
    Blanco et al., 2010, Galelli et al., 2015, Galelli et al., 2014, Xu et al., 2020)
    to seasonal or longer scales (e.g., Anghileri et al., 2016, Gavahi et al., 2019,
    Raso and Malaterre, 2017, Xu et al., 2015). However, multiple timescales have
    never been incorporated into a seamless multi-timescale system in any case study.
    Despite changes in societal perceptions of water resources generally enlarge the
    number of objectives considered (e.g., Giuliani, Galelli and Soncini-Sessa, 2014,
    Giuliani, Herman et al., 2014, Wild et al., 2019), a large majority of the studies
    we considered formulate a single-objective control problem (e.g., Arsenault and
    Cote, 2019, Breckpot et al., 2013, Sahu and McLaughlin, 2018, Wang, 2010, Xu et
    al., 2015) or an a-priori aggregation of multiple objectives (e.g., Castelletti
    et al., 2008a, Kistenmacher and Georgakakos, 2015, Uysal, Alvarado-Montero et
    al., 2018a), with very few exceptions that consider either 2 or 3 competing objectives
    (e.g., Giuliani and Castelletti, 2013, Lin et al., 2020, Mohanavelu et al., 2022,
    Xu et al., 2020) (see Table 4). The scalability of MPC to multi- and many-objective
    control problems is indeed an important limitation for the application of this
    control strategy to water reservoir systems (Giuliani et al., 2021), which often
    has limited ability in exploring multi-dimensional trade-offs (e.g., Giuliani
    et al., 2016). About half of the reviewed articles (see Table 4) provide a comparison
    between MPC against an alternative, off-line control strategy often designed via
    Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) or against the current operational schemes
    of real-world reservoirs (e.g., Castelletti et al., 2008a, Sahu and McLaughlin,
    2018, Xu et al., 2015). All these studies found that MPC outperforms other strategies.
    This is often attributed to the fact that MPC ensures that the control is adapting
    to extreme events that can be forecasted in the short- to long-term based on current
    observations and other forecast data (e.g., Ahmad and Hussain, 2019, Ficchi et
    al., 2016, Galelli et al., 2014). However, the choice of a reservoir control method
    is expected to depend upon multiple factors, including the system’s characteristics,
    the objectives of the control, the specified constraints, data and forecast availability
    (Macian-Sorribes & Pulido-Velazquez, 2020). So large comparison studies are needed
    to investigate MPC’s applicability, effectiveness, and value in different contexts.
    Only a few studies benchmark MPC against multiple state-of-the-art control methods,
    such as different Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) methods (see Table 4).
    Notably, Mohanavelu et al. (2022) compare six state-of-the-art control methods
    for the operation of a real-world reservoir system in India (i.e., the Pong reservoir).
    They found that MPC outperforms all the other methods, yielding the closest solution
    to the ideal one designed via Deterministic Dynamic Programming (DDP). A limitation
    of their study is that MPC was driven by a single forecast close to perfect forecasts,
    so further studies are needed to extend such comparisons for different case studies
    and use real forecasts with different levels of skill and timescales within the
    MPC. Similarly, Kergus, Formentin, Giuliani, and Castelletti (2022) benchmark
    an MPC-based approach against SDP and the ideal DDP solution with perfect foresight
    for the operation of a reservoir in Vietnam (Hoa Binh). Their MPC-like approach
    (combining hierarchically MPC with an inner parametric data-driven feedback controller)
    uses statistical forecasts with a random noise added on the disturbances. Despite
    the error in the disturbance predictions, the MPC-based approach outperforms SDP
    by obtaining better trade-offs between the two objectives (hydropower and flood
    control) and approaches the ideal solution by DDP. However, as pointed out by
    Kergus et al. (2022), while these results are encouraging for MPC, the robustness
    to prediction errors requires further investigation. Likewise, other six studies
    (Ahmad and Hussain, 2019, Castelletti et al., 2008a, Galelli et al., 2014, Payet-Burin
    et al., 2021, Sahu and McLaughlin, 2018, Wang, 2010) benchmark MPC with SDP reaching
    similar conclusions. MPC approaches outperform the offline benchmark by better
    anticipating the inflow events, especially those out of their typical season,
    even if a simple inflow forecasting model is used (e.g., Castelletti et al., 2008a,
    Wang, 2010). MPC generally leads to better trade-offs between objectives, with
    the performance increasing with increased prediction horizon (e.g., Castelletti
    et al., 2008a, Galelli et al., 2014). MPC can also deal with problems that are
    computationally intractable by SDP due to the number of reservoirs in the system
    (e.g., Wang, 2010), as it overcomes the curses of dimensionality and modelling
    of SDP. A limitation of the current body of literature on MPC for reservoir operation
    is that most studies do not assess the impact of the MPC internal model uncertainty,
    as usually the same models have been used for both the open-loop optimization
    and closed-loop simulation (with the associated update of model states) in almost
    all studies reviewed. A few exceptions exist (Lin et al., 2020, Munier et al.,
    2015). For example, Lin et al. (2020) used two different models: a simplified
    internal model was used in the open-loop optimization, as is usually done in MPC,
    and a more refined and computationally-intensive model was employed to represent
    the real water system in closed-loop, to update water levels and flows. 3.2. MPC
    for open channels An initial set of 193 research journal papers was obtained using
    the query formulated in Section 2.3, of which only 58 were retained after the
    manual screening of titles and abstracts (see PRISMA diagram in Fig. 4). Inspection
    of the time distribution of the final set of papers (depicted in Fig. 5) reveals
    that all papers were published less than twenty years ago (and twenty-six of them
    less than five years ago), which allows identifying a growing interest in the
    topic (see Fig. 5). It is also worth noting that three other review papers were
    returned by the query: although not strictly research papers, they are surveyed
    for completeness. An exhaustive review of modelling and control of open-channel
    irrigation systems is carried out in Conde et al. (2021), and an entire section
    (Section 4.5.3) is devoted to MPC. Different applications of smart agriculture
    are presented in Ding et al. (2018), including the use of MPC for irrigation systems
    (Section 3.1). The developments of an industrial-scale project that culminated
    in the complete automation of a large irrigation system in Australia are discussed
    in Mareels et al. (2005). Although MPC approaches are not explicitly developed
    therein, the same research group has recently employed MPC to control a river
    (Foo, Ooi, & Weyer, 2014) and an irrigation canal (Nasir, Cantoni, Li, & Weyer,
    2021). Control of water canals and rivers aims to satisfy human needs, which are
    expressed in the form of a cost function. Most of the reviewed papers are characterized
    by cost functions built as the weighted sum of individual terms (i.e., the relative
    importance of each term is adjusted using weights), with the minimization of water
    level setpoint tracking errors and operational costs being the most common objectives
    (see Table 4). Additional goals, e.g., simultaneous control of water quantity
    and quality (Aydin et al., 2022, Aydin et al., 2019, Xu et al., 2013), preservation
    of water levels within safe navigation bounds (Horvath et al., 2022, Pour et al.,
    2022, Segovia et al., 2019, Tian et al., 2019, Wagenpfeil et al., 2012) and pressure
    reduction for the pressurized part of the network (Zhu et al., 2020), are also
    considered in the literature. Moreover, Foo et al. (2014) tailor a cost function
    to the needs of their case study, e.g., maintain off-stream storage volume above
    a threshold, release as little water from a lake as possible and keep flows for
    early spring to mid-summer under a threshold to create slack-water pockets. On
    a wider note, joint water and energy management in water canals appears to be
    a topic of increasing interest in the water-energy nexus context (Doan et al.,
    2013, Horvath et al., 2022, Pour et al., 2022, van der Heijden et al., 2022).
    Operational management of water canals is carried out by manipulating the available
    actuators. Inspection of the surveyed papers reveals the use of a wide variety
    of actuators, i.e., gates, weirs, sluices, pumping stations, dams, turbines and
    electro-valves (see Table 3). Control decisions are either actuator flow or position
    setpoints; an assessment of the optimal choice of the input variable is carried
    out in Horvath, Galvis, Gomez Valentin, and Rodellar Benede (2015b). These decisions
    are computed over prediction horizons (the reviewed papers report values ranging
    from one minute to ten days), and are applied with fixed frequencies (ranging
    from once every five seconds to once every six hours) for the whole duration of
    the experiment (ranging from thirty minutes to one year). The effect of these
    decisions on the system is measured using available sensors that capture relevant
    information, e.g., water levels, salinity and concentration of chemical species.
    This information, together with estimates of unmeasurable states (obtained using
    observers), allows adjusting the decisions at the next time step. It is interesting
    to highlight the large variability in terms of time scales across reviewed papers
    (see Table 1, Table 3). These differences can be explained by the different nature
    of the experiments: real case studies, either on a real system (Foo et al., 2014,
    Nasir et al., 2021) or in silico (Kong, Quan et al., 2019, Romera et al., 2013,
    Tian, Aydin et al., 2017a), laboratory canals (Aydin et al., 2017, Figueiredo
    et al., 2013, Horvath et al., 2015a, Horvath et al., 2015b, Lemos et al., 2009,
    van Overloop et al., 2014), canal benchmarks (Rodriguez et al., 2020, Wahlin,
    2004, Wahlin and Clemmens, 2006b) and academic examples (Breckpot et al., 2013,
    Xu et al., 2012, Xu et al., 2011, Xu et al., 2013, Xu and Schwanenberg, 2017)
    are reported . In particular, laboratory canals are characterized by reduced dimensions
    in comparison to the rest of the case studies, which explains the use of smaller
    time scales. It was discussed in Section 2.1 that MPC is a model-based approach
    and that, as such, an internal model is required to predict the effect of control
    actions on the system. Existing open-channel internal models have been presented
    in Section 2.2.2. On the one hand, some of the employed models are directly derived
    from the Saint-Venant equations, e.g., discretizing the system in space and linearizing
    (Aydin et al., 2022, Aydin et al., 2019, Tian et al., 2015, Wagenpfeil et al.,
    2012, Xu et al., 2012). On the other hand, other papers resort to the integrator
    delay (Askari Fard et al., 2022, Avargani et al., 2022, Hashemy Shahdany et al.,
    2017, Kong, Quan et al., 2019, Liu et al., 2023, Rodriguez et al., 2020, Zheng
    et al., 2019), the integrator delay zero (Pour et al., 2022, Romera et al., 2013,
    Segovia et al., 2019) and the integrator resonance (Horvath et al., 2015a, Horvath
    et al., 2015b, van Overloop et al., 2014) models. While a large variety of models
    is employed in the reviewed papers, it can be concluded that the use of the ID
    model is prevalent (in its equivalent state–space form). Finally, a model-free
    strategy is proposed by Ren et al. (2021), whereby control policies are obtained
    via deep reinforcement learning. The performance of MPC is also affected by disturbances.
    Water canals are operated under time-varying environmental conditions, which are
    exogenous inputs that attenuate the effect of control actions and thus complicate
    the attainment of the operational objectives. Therefore, the occurrence of these
    events may have a severe effect on water levels unless properly accounted for
    in the MPC design. Although the type of disturbance considered depends on the
    case study, uncontrolled in- and/or outflow forecasts, e.g., rainfall (Maestre
    et al., 2013, Negenborn et al., 2009, van Overloop et al., 2008, Velarde et al.,
    2019, Xu et al., 2011), surface-groundwater interaction (Aydin et al., 2019, Foo
    et al., 2014) and sea discharges (Tian et al., 2015, van der Heijden et al., 2022,
    van Ekeren et al., 2013), are typically used (see Table 1). In addition to these,
    operational disturbances, e.g., offtake flows for irrigation purposes (Breckpot
    et al., 2013, Hashemy et al., 2013, Kong, Lei et al., 2019, Kong et al., 2021,
    Shahdany et al., 2015, Shahdany et al., 2016, Shahdany et al., 2019, van Overloop,
    Clemmens et al., 2010, van Overloop et al., 2015, Wahlin, 2004, Wahlin and Clemmens,
    2006a, Wahlin and Clemmens, 2006b, Xu, 2017, Zheng et al., 2019), wind effect
    (Wagenpfeil et al., 2012) and lock operations for navigation purposes (Pour et
    al., 2022, Segovia et al., 2019), are also considered. While either perfect or
    no knowledge about operational demands is usually considered (scheduled and unscheduled
    operations, respectively), uncertain meteorological conditions have motivated
    the development of stochastic MPC approaches for water canals (Maestre et al.,
    2013, Nasir et al., 2021, Tian et al., 2019, Tian, Negenborn et al., 2017b, van
    Overloop et al., 2008, Velarde et al., 2019), whereby different disturbance realizations
    with individual occurrence probabilities are considered (see Table 2). In terms
    of the architecture of controllers for water canals, given the characteristics
    of centralized/distributed controllers (as introduced in Section 2.1), distributed
    control architectures appear to be preferable to overcome the computational and
    scalability drawbacks arising from centralized implementations. However, only
    eight papers consider distributed architectures (see Table 3), of which four are
    characterized by a two-layer structure in which the top layer takes care of the
    high-level problem setup: uncertainty realization (Velarde et al., 2019), reduction
    of communication overhead among local controllers (Farhadi & Khodabandehlou, 2016),
    selection of optimal network topology (Fele, Maestre, Hashemy, Munoz de la Pena,
    & Camacho, 2014) and execution of risk mitigation actions (Zafra-Cabeza, Maestre,
    Ridao, Camacho, & Sanchez, 2011). The remaining four papers consider distributed
    single-level architectures (Alvarez et al., 2013, Doan et al., 2013, Maestre et
    al., 2013, Negenborn et al., 2009). The reduced number of papers that employ distributed
    multi-level architectures may be explained by the fact that the choice of control
    architecture depends mostly on the extent to which systems are coupled, communication
    reliability and computational resource availability. Canals have been traditionally
    regulated either manually or using decentralized proportional–integral (PI) controllers
    that adjust the setpoints dictated by a centralized coordinator (Nasir et al.,
    2021, Sadowska et al., 2015, Sadowska et al., 2014), which means that coupling
    effects might not be too relevant for their usual operation. The benchmarking
    of MPC performance against other approaches is rarely included in the literature
    on open-channel control, as shown in Table 4. MPC is only compared to other two
    control approaches, namely LQR (Kong, Lei et al., 2019, Liu et al., 2023, van
    Overloop, Clemmens et al., 2010, Wahlin and Clemmens, 2006a, Zheng et al., 2019)
    and PI(D) (Figueiredo et al., 2013, Foo et al., 2014, Kong, Lei et al., 2019,
    Lemos et al., 2009, Liu et al., 2023, van Overloop et al., 2015, van Overloop
    et al., 2008, Wahlin, 2004, Wahlin and Clemmens, 2006b), whereby the superior
    performance of MPC is demonstrated. Furthermore, although not explicitly reported
    in Table 4, benchmarking MPC against manual control demonstrates that MPC leads
    to better performance and thus improved system operation (Askari Fard et al.,
    2022, Foo et al., 2014). As a final remark, not all papers report information
    regarding, e.g., nature of the forecast, system size (number of states), prediction
    horizon, frequency of decisions and optimization method, in an explicit manner.
    This fact complicates the analysis of the reviewed references. 3.3. MPC for urban
    water networks The query to retrieve peer-reviewed journal articles on MPC developments
    and applications to control urban water networks (see Section 2.3) returned an
    initial set of 521 papers. From this set of papers, 453 were excluded from further
    analysis after manually screening each paper’s title and abstract, 1 was not accessible
    to the authors, and 19 more were excluded based on relevance and fit within the
    scope of this review (see PRISMA diagram in Fig. 4). As a result, a subset of
    48 articles was retained for detailed tagging and classification. This group of
    48 papers corresponds to 9.2% of the initial dataset of papers retrieved with
    the formulated query. Many of the excluded papers were initially obtained as a
    result of the search query because they include the keywords listed in the search
    query in their main text or other parts. However, they were then deemed not relevant
    in relation to the scope of this review primarily either because of their actual
    MPC implementation (they only mentioned MPC or other control schemes but eventually
    only focused on model development), or because of their spatial scale of interest.
    Many studies indeed mentioned urban water systems and networks but eventually
    focused only on optimal control of processes occurring in individual network components
    (e.g., water treatment plants). For the above reasons, many papers initially identified
    in the search were assessed as not eligible for consideration in this review.
    The time distribution of these 48 articles shows that the last 25 years have witnessed
    an increasing interest towards the implementation of MPC schemes to control urban
    water networks. Likely motivated by the increasing amount of (quasi) real-time
    sensor data from distributed infrastructure networks, which act as enablers of
    real-time control schemes (Creaco et al., 2019), more than 45% of the reviewed
    studies ( ) were published in the last 5 years only (see Fig. 5). Integrated urban
    water management requires optimal planning and operations of different network
    systems which make up the urban water cycle, including drinking water networks,
    stormwater, greywater, and wastewater networks. Accordingly, examples of MPC developments
    and applications emerge from the literature on supply-side management of drinking
    water networks and stormwater and wastewater management. In addition, other recent
    publications reviewed the existing literature on control schemes for urban water
    networks. Yet, their scope is rather constrained to only one type of network infrastructure,
    i.e., sewer and drainage systems (Lund et al., 2018, Van Der Werf et al., 2022)
    or water supply and distribution networks (Coelho & Andrade-Campos, 2014), and
    various control schemes are considered. Conversely, the scope of this review is
    only spatially constrained by the boundaries of the integrated urban water system
    and thematically by the focus on MPC-like control. Still, it is inclusive of all
    its sub-components. This review thus compares MPC studies focused on drinking
    water networks, as well as wastewater and sewage networks, to identify the type
    of disturbances, objectives, actuators, and type of MPC in each case, ultimately
    evaluating the benefits brought by MPC and its related challenges. Most of the
    reviewed papers address the problem of optimal control of water distribution and
    transport networks ( ). The typical research goal in these works is to identify
    optimal operations of pumps and valves, i.e., the actuators distributed in a water
    distribution/transport network. The number of actuators in network infrastructure
    systems depends on the considered network’s topological and structural characteristics
    and size. Their number affects the number of control variables in the optimal
    control problem. In our compilation of reviewed papers (see Table 3), control
    variables vary from less than 10 in simplified or small systems (e.g., Housh and
    Salomons, 2019, Rao and Salomons, 2007, Salomons and Housh, 2020a, Salomons and
    Housh, 2020b, Sankar et al., 2015) to more than 120 in larger, real-world systems
    (Cembrano et al., 2011, Ocampo-Martinez et al., 2011). Water distribution systems
    are operated under varying water demand conditions. Forecasts of water demand
    are thus needed as input to the underlying hydraulic or data-driven models used
    in MPC. Water demand forecasts usually span over a period of 24 h, relying on
    the day/night periodicity of water demand patterns, whereas the frequency of decisions
    is in the range of a few minutes (e.g., 5 min as in Liu, Zheng, Wu, and Li (2020))
    and 1 h (Limon et al., 2014, Pascual et al., 2013, Pereira et al., 2016, Wang
    et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2020). Controls in water transport and distribution
    networks are computed in such a way that an economic objective accounting for
    the cost of running the system (mainly due to electricity consumption for water
    pumping and pump start-up costs) is minimized, while water demands in the system
    are satisfied (e.g., Shamir & Salomons, 2008). Additional objectives such as guaranteeing
    safety storage in water tanks, pressure control, or smoothness of the controls
    are also often weighted in the complete objective function (e.g., Grosso et al.,
    2014, Grosso et al., 2016, Martin et al., 2022, Ocampo-Martinez et al., 2012,
    Pour et al., 2019, Pour et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2018). Only
    three recent papers explicitly consider multiple objectives, including one on
    optimal reconfigurations of large-scale systems via backup actuator activation
    formulated as a multi-objective mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem with two
    separate objectives (see Table 3), which was then solved with a lexicographic
    approach (Trapiello, Puig, & Cembrano, 2021). A minority of works also considers
    water quality objectives, typically quantified via chlorine concentration in the
    supplied water (Biscos et al., 2002, Biscos et al., 2003, Muslim et al., 2008).
    The remaining 14 papers deal with optimal management of sewer and drainage infrastructure,
    where pumps and gates should be controlled to guarantee cost-effective and smooth
    operations, reduced peak flow to wastewater treatment plants, flood control, and
    avoid overflow in combined systems (CSOs; Darsono and Labadie, 2007, Dong and
    Yang, 2019, El Ghazouli et al., 2022, Joseph-Duran et al., 2014a, Joseph-Duran
    et al., 2014b, Joseph-Duran et al., 2015, Kändler et al., 2022, Marinaki et al.,
    1999, Puig et al., 2009, Shishegar et al., 2021, Sun et al., 2020, Svensen et
    al., 2021, Wang et al., 2021a, van der Werf et al., 2021). Rainfall is usually
    the uncertain variable to be forecasted (see Table 1), typically with a sub-hourly
    prediction horizon (e.g., 30 mins in Joseph-Duran et al., 2014b, Sun et al., 2020),
    which provides information on the expected inflow to the system to design optimal
    decisions of gates to be applied with an operational frequency of 1–5 min (Joseph-Duran
    et al., 2014b, Joseph-Duran et al., 2015, Marinaki et al., 1999, Sun et al., 2020)
    to a few hours or a day (Dong & Yang, 2019). Further, a limited yet recently growing
    number of articles (not included in this review) develops control schemes based
    on MPC to operate pumps as turbines and harness the excess energy that would be
    otherwise dissipated for electricity production (Levieux et al., 2021, Pirard
    et al., 2022, Stefanizzi et al., 2020, Venturini et al., 2017). While they are
    not included in this review because they are not directly concerned with the optimal
    management of water resources, it is worth mentioning them as recent literature
    is shaping around joint opportunities for water and energy management within the
    broader context of the water-energy nexus. The reviewed papers present a variety
    of applications and case studies, with different formulations of the objective
    function, controls, disturbances and forecasting horizon, system characteristics,
    and overall goals. Hence, results are also often case-specific and hard to generalize.
    However, in most reviewed works, MPC schemes – primarily implemented with a centralized
    architecture – are benchmarked against other control strategies and comparatively
    attain a better performance (i.e., reduced operational costs and violation of
    physical and operational constraints). Historical/current rule-based controls
    are usually taken as baseline reference (e.g., in Bakker et al., 2013, Balla et
    al., 2022, Guo et al., 2022, Salomons et al., 2007, Wang et al., 2020), along
    with local controllers (Puig et al., 2009) and PI controllers (Fiorelli et al.,
    2013, Muslim et al., 2008) in a limited number of cases. A solid alternative for
    either implementing non-centralized control approaches or complementing control
    strategies for the management of UWNs is based on evolutionary game theory (Quijano
    et al., 2017). For the former case, several proposals have been reported towards
    not only designing predictive controllers accounting for the suitable partitioning
    of a large-scale drinking water network (Barreiro-Gomez et al., 2019, Muros et
    al., 2018) but also the synthesis of control strategies entirely based on such
    game theory (Barreiro-Gomez, Ocampo-Martinez, Quijano, and Maestre, 2017, Barreiro-Gomez
    et al., 2016, Obando et al., 2022). Regarding game-theory-based approaches that
    assist a predictive controller, tuning methodologies for multi-objective predictive
    controllers are also reported (Barreiro-Gomez, Ocampo-Martinez & Quijano, 2017).
    Overall, MPC has proven to be effective in attaining substantial cost savings
    in comparison to existing rule-based or set-point controllers in water distribution
    networks, which usually operate based on storage level thresholds. For instance,
    energy cost savings between 8% and 10% were calculated with simulations for a
    summer and winter month in Shamir and Salomons (2008). Other studies considering
    MPC controllers in urban drainage networks found that MPC can reduce the number
    of flooded nodes during an extreme weather event and lower peak flow by more than
    50% in drainage systems subject to heavy rainfall events (Kändler et al., 2022,
    Shishegar et al., 2021). Case-specific results and cost/energy savings referred
    to different baseline values, implementations of the objective functions, and
    MPC parameters, though, do not allow for a direct quantitative comparison of MPC
    performance across studies. Further, several limitations and existing research
    gaps emerge from the analysis of the 48 reviewed papers. Most of the considered
    studies adopt, at least to some extent, a series of simplifications to address
    the challenges related to (i) accounting for uncertainties in disturbance prediction
    and (ii) dealing with the computational burden of simulating potentially large
    real-world networks in model-based approaches. Concerning the first group of challenges,
    only eight studies out of 48 consider the uncertainty in disturbance forecasts
    by implementing a stochastic or combined deterministic and stochastic MPC approach
    (e.g., Grosso et al., 2017, Pedrosa et al., 2022). The majority instead focuses
    on demonstrating the superiority of MPC in comparison to other control strategies
    under a deterministic scenario. This scenario is sometimes built assuming perfect
    disturbance prediction (Marinaki et al., 1999, Tedesco et al., 2016) or simple
    statistics on water demands from past data, while the type of forecast remains
    unclear in many other cases. Concerning the second group of challenges, reducing
    the computational effort required to simulate large real-world networks is addressed
    in the literature with three different types of simplification approaches. First,
    some studies only consider very small networks, usually built ad hoc as artificial
    systems for research purposes, composed of a handful of nodes and just a few actuators
    (e.g., Sankar et al., 2015, Sun et al., 2016). This approach also makes up for
    the lack of data that often limits the possibility of developing studies based
    on real-world urban water networks. Other studies instead simplify the size of
    existing real-world systems by removing irrelevant nodes and links and obtaining
    a skeletonized system (as, for instance, in Shamir & Salomons, 2008). Beside the
    physical properties of the considered system, its operational properties and the
    physical characteristics of its actuators are often simplified, too. For example,
    some work only consider fixed-speed pumps, simple valve models characterized only
    by upper and lower bounds on the flow, and none consider dynamic/time-varying
    energy prices, but a few exceptions. Our review found that approximately 32 studies
    are based on simplified or synthetic case studies, while only 16 rely on full-scale
    real-world systems or systems not explicitly simplified. A third strategy to deal
    with the computational effort required by the simulation of large-scale hydraulic
    networks is the implementation of data-driven surrogate (or meta-) models that
    substitute the high-fidelity hydraulic model with more computationally efficient
    yet still accurate models that can be coupled with optimization. Dong and Yang
    (2019), for instance, implement a long-short-term memory (LSTM) neural network
    for operation scheduling of water diversion and drainage pumping stations in the
    presence of complex hydrometeorological constraints. Many research efforts have
    been recently developed revolving around surrogate models, also pushed by recent
    development in artificial neural networks and deep learning (e.g., Fiedler, Cominola,
    & Lucia, 2020). As many are pretty recent and only appear so far in conference
    proceedings, they might not have been captured by our review. Finally, it must
    be noted that, while it was possible to identify the above trends and challenges,
    one non-negligible finding is that many works do not report sufficient details
    on the type of forecasts, system size (state variables), implemented optimization
    method, benchmark, and in some cases even the actual formulation of the objective
    function. This limits our capabilities to carry out a complete analysis of the
    attributes of such studies and, in general, hampers their full reproducibility.
    4. Discussion While the three types of water systems considered (water reservoirs,
    open channels and urban water networks) feature domain-specific physical characteristics
    and different types of actuators, objectives, and disturbances that should be
    accounted for in a control problem, common advantages/drawbacks of MPC, trends
    and challenges emerge from this review. MPC offers three primary advantages over
    more conventional SDP and ADP methods: (A1) MPC overcomes the so-called ‘curse
    of dimensionality’ of Dynamic Programming, as it avoids the computation of the
    value function, by iterating the optimal control problem over a finite receding
    horizon; as a result, the computation costs of MPC do not increase exponentially
    with problem size (i.e., state and control dimension), which makes MPC a more
    viable approach for large-scale multi-reservoir systems with more than three reservoirs
    (e.g., Ficchi et al., 2016, Kistenmacher and Georgakakos, 2015, Wang, 2010), as
    well as for large OC (e.g., Kong et al., 2021, Rodriguez et al., 2020, Shahdany
    et al., 2019) and UWN (e.g., Martínez et al., 2007, Tedesco et al., 2016, Wang
    et al., 2021b). (A2) MPC overcomes the ‘curse of modeling’ of DP by allowing the
    optimization model to take updated decisions at each time step with a real-time
    receding horizon strategy, making use of existing models and optimization frameworks
    (e.g., Mohanavelu et al., 2022, Nasir et al., 2021, Segovia et al., 2019). (A3)
    MPC can deal with hydro-climatic variability, nonstationarities and uncertainty
    (e.g., Castelletti et al., 2008a, Maestre et al., 2013, Payet-Burin et al., 2021,
    Velarde et al., 2019). By using real-time information and probabilistic forecasts
    in the optimization process, MPC allows water systems operation to adapt to changes
    in the climate or catchment and to mitigate the impacts of extreme hydrological
    events anticipating them, particularly those occurring in unusual periods of the
    year (e.g., Castelletti et al., 2008a). These advantages make MPC a more effective
    control technique and more feasible than DP for large water systems (especially
    large channel and urban water networks), as shown in a few studies benchmarking
    MPC against DP/ADP methods. Although MPC has these advantages over more conventional
    DP and off-line methods, it also has a few drawbacks: (D1) The iterative optimization
    involved in MPC can also lead to intensive computations, especially for large-scale
    water systems with many actuators and a centralized controller. For example, for
    open channels, Ren et al. (2021) discuss how the computation burden associated
    with MPC can be a significant obstacle in large-scale systems with high-dimensional
    state and control spaces, making it impractical to perform online calculations
    at each time step; they call this a ’curse of dimensionality’ for MPC too, though
    this is less prohibitive than for DP. Other authors have also paid attention to
    the trade-off between solution optimality and computation time, and have tested
    different MPC formulations to verify conditions under which optimal control actions
    may be determined within a prescribed real-time control period. For instance,
    Xu et al. (2012) test quadratic-programming-based (QP) and sequential-quadratic-programming-based
    (SQP) MPC, and find out that SQP-MPC achieves better control performance than
    QP-MPC at the expense of highly increased computation times (execution is 30 times
    slower). Alternative approaches to overcome the costs related to centralized MPC
    controllers applied to large-scale systems and to foster scalability have been
    explored also in urban water networks. Tedesco et al. (2016), for instance, test
    the use of distributed approaches (command governor strategies), in which the
    global control system is decomposed and local controllers are used, each responsible
    for the supervision of each subsystem. (D2) The performance of MPC is highly dependent
    on reliable prediction models, which may not be available for large-scale systems
    over long prediction horizons, making MPC-based control approaches ineffective
    in some cases (e.g., Ren et al., 2021). Two main common trends can be identified:
    (T1) an increasing number of studies adopting ML-based models to predict the disturbances
    (e.g., inflows, tides); (T2) an expanding proportion of stochastic MPC applications
    over the last decade (since 2013), though still a minority to deterministic MPC.
    The main challenges currently limiting the scope of MPC studies can be grouped
    into the following four categories, which should serve as main goals to formulate
    a research agenda for the next few years: (C1) lack of benchmarking studies that
    comprehensively compare MPC against other control schemes and assess its performance
    in relation to the characteristics of the physical system; (C2) lack of assessment
    of the uncertainty embedded in the model-based control and simplifications adopted
    in the model structure; (C3) incomplete analysis on the impact of the type of
    forecast, forecast resolution, and length of the prediction horizon; and (C4)
    limited exploration of tradeoffs and truly multi-objective MPC problems, to go
    beyond the single-objective nature of the problem formulation (that is often achieved
    via aggregation of multiple objectives functions appearing in multi-objective
    problems). Related to the first challenge (C1) of evaluating the performance of
    MPC comprehensively and objectively, in most of the reviewed studies, there is
    a lack of consistent benchmarking of MPC with respect to other control methods
    and across systems with different characteristics. Only a few studies compare
    MPC against multiple alternative techniques, and none compare MPC with off-line
    alternatives using available forecasts in real-world settings. Most past studies
    across all types of considered water systems either used only perfect forecasts
    to set the upper-bound performance used as “ideal” Ref. (e.g., Marinaki et al.,
    1999, Uysal, Alvarado-Montero et al., 2018a), or focused on an off-line benchmark
    control scheme without actual forecasts, but rather with historical operations,
    typically based on rule curves or other set-point approaches (e.g., Delgoda et
    al., 2013, Wang et al., 2020, Xu et al., 2015) and Stochastic Dynamic Programming
    (e.g., Galelli et al., 2014, Kergus et al., 2022, Wang, 2010). A comparative analysis
    of the MPC performance in different contexts and in relation to case-specific
    characteristics (e.g., physical features of the system, constraints, objectives,
    etc.) would be important to assess the dependence between such characteristics
    and expected MPC results. However, many different factors are varying across the
    reviewed studies and for different types of systems, both in terms of system characteristics
    and optimization problem parameters. Thus, a direct comparison of existing quantitative
    results would not be meaningful. A fair comparative analysis would instead require
    consistent benchmarking studies comparing the relative performance of MPC with
    respect to the same benchmark control method across studies. We acknowledge that
    the performance of MPC can be affected by the characteristics of the basin, hydrology
    of the open channels, and other factors, which can vary significantly between
    different geographic regions. Therefore, further studies carrying out comparative
    analyses of MPC with consistent settings and with real-world data (beside synthetic
    cases, which are frequent in the reviewed papers) should be considered for water
    reservoirs, urban water networks, and open channels. As for C2, the key element
    of MPC is the use of a model of the system to be controlled, yet models are always
    subject to errors, inaccuracies, and uncertainties. MPC leverages the accuracy
    of the models of the systems to ensure the robustness of the controller with respect
    to uncertainties (e.g., Schwenzer et al., 2021). Many studies reviewed recognize
    this aspect and provide at least some insights into the accuracy of the chosen
    internal models, supporting their choice (e.g., Ficchi et al., 2016, Galelli et
    al., 2014, Giuliani and Castelletti, 2013, Munier et al., 2015). However, some
    studies do not analyse the model’s accuracy in sufficient detail, and few do not
    provide any information on this. Moreover, most of the studies reviewed (more
    than 100 out of 149) do not assess the impact of the MPC internal model uncertainty
    as usually the same models for both the open-loop optimization and closed-loop
    simulation (with an associated update of model states) have been used. This is
    especially the case for water reservoirs and urban water networks. Only for open
    channels, most of the studies ( 30 out of 58, with few studies with unclear information)
    test MPC with a different internal prediction model than the model used for the
    closed-loop simulation. Simplified versions of the Saint-Venant equations are
    usually used as an internal model in the MPC, while the full Saint-Venant equations,
    implemented in software solutions such as SOBEK (e.g., Fele et al., 2014, Hashemy
    Shahdany et al., 2017, Liu et al., 2023, Tian et al., 2019, van Overloop, Clemmens
    et al., 2010, Wahlin and Clemmens, 2006b) and SIC2 (e.g., Alvarez et al., 2013,
    Horvath et al., 2015a, Horvath et al., 2015b, Pour et al., 2022, Segovia et al.,
    2019, van Overloop et al., 2014), are used as closed-loop simulation models. Using
    the same internal model for the closed-loop simulation is likely to lead to an
    overestimation of the MPC performance, but this is the solution adopted by many
    authors for two obvious reasons: (i) computation time reduction, and (ii) lack
    of more (refined) models readily available. For water reservoirs, only a few studies
    (e.g., Lin et al., 2020, Munier et al., 2015) have adopted a more refined and
    computationally-intensive model for the closed-loop simulation, which is essential
    to assess the robustness of the controller. Moreover, many studies, primarily
    on MPC applications in urban water networks, rely on simplified or synthetic systems
    (e.g., Sankar et al., 2015) due to the limited availability of calibrated high-fidelity
    models and the computational requirements of coupled hydraulic and water quality
    simulations of large-scale network systems models. While more computationally-efficient
    alternatives exist, including data-driven surrogate models (see Section 3.3),
    they often come with a tradeoff between computational savings and model accuracy.
    This should also be better quantified, possibly in relation to system size and
    characteristics. Regarding the type of forecasts used in MPC (C3), various forecast
    variables, types and models emerge from the current literature, with differences
    depending on the type of water systems considered. In terms of forecasted variables,
    for water reservoirs, all the studies used either rainfall, inflow or tide forecasts.
    For urban water networks, water demand forecasts are mostly used, with a minority
    of studies also using rainfall/inflow or water levels. On the other hand, a more
    diverse set of forecasts are used for open channels, with more than half using
    water demand forecasts, less than half rainfall/inflow and a few other variables
    (see Table 1). In terms of the type of forecasts, for urban water networks, almost
    all the few studies relying on real (non-perfect) forecasts used statistical or
    ML-based models (e.g., Dong and Yang, 2019, Salvador et al., 2020). For open channels,
    six studies used statistical or ML-based models (e.g., Maestre et al., 2013, Tian,
    Negenborn et al., 2017b), five used process-based models (e.g., Aydin et al.,
    2019, Xu et al., 2013), and a single study used a hybrid approach (van Overloop
    et al., 2008). The picture is more complex for water reservoirs, for which the
    studies adopting real forecasts used more sources and forecasting techniques:
    less than half of them used well-established process-based hydrological models
    fed by operational meteorological forecasts (e.g., Ficchi et al., 2016, Raso et
    al., 2014, Wang et al., 2014) to produce the forecasts used in MPC, while slightly
    more than half used statistical or machine learning-based models that are calibrated
    on past observed data (e.g., Galelli et al., 2015, Gavahi et al., 2019, Giuliani
    and Castelletti, 2013, Pianosi and Soncini-Sessa, 2009). Only a few studies compared
    or integrated these two different techniques (Ahmad and Hussain, 2019, Wei and
    Xun, 2019). Given the recent increase in the availability of both real hydro-meteorological
    forecasts and efficient machine learning models, it is logical to expect benefits
    from more testing of hybrid forecast products in MPC and further applications
    are needed. Along the same lines, also the availability of forecasts at multiple
    timescales has been increasing, from short-range (few days) to seasonal- or long-range
    (up to 6–7 months or a year), and there is growing interest in seamless forecasts
    (e.g., Wetterhall & Di Giuseppe, 2018). However, there is a lack of research integrating
    multiple forecast products across time scales in MPC. Moreover, there is a lack
    of research investigating the dependence of the optimal prediction horizon and
    relative MPC performance on the accuracy of forecasts. The optimal horizon and
    the MPC performance are expected to be intensely dependent on the quality of the
    forecasts (e.g., Payet-Burin et al., 2021, Wei and Xun, 2019), and this dependence
    is not trivial due to the receding horizon and on-line update of the control strategy.
    Finally, a key point for multipurpose water systems is that only a limited number
    of studies explored possible Multi-Objective (MO) MPC frameworks (e.g., Lin et
    al., 2020) typically required to address the tradeoffs across sectors by providing
    a set of Pareto-optimal solutions (C4). The majority of the reviewed papers rather
    compute a weighted sum of the objectives (e.g., Dong and Yang, 2019, Tedesco et
    al., 2016), which aggregates multiple objectives in an individual objective function,
    and some authors reduce the number of objectives by enforcing more constraints
    in the control problem. Further work is needed to explore Pareto-optimal solutions
    from MPC both at each control time step and over a long simulation horizon rolled
    by multiple receding horizons to account for the multi-objective nature of water
    systems’ operation problems and enable tradeoff analysis. Lastly, we noticed that
    the level of detail in reporting model description, optimal control problem formulation
    and explanation of the proposed control/management methodology is heterogeneous
    across the collection of reviewed papers. In many cases, there is no sufficient
    level of detail in the reviewed journal articles to allow for a full and fair
    comparison. A final recommendation is thus to develop a standardized framework
    to report key information on the essential components of future MPC studies (e.g.,
    type of forecasts, system size and state variables, implemented optimization method,
    benchmark methods, objective function, control variables, their number and their
    frequency) to facilitate comparison across studies, ultimately supporting knowledge
    transfer and reproducibility. 5. Conclusions In recent years, Model Predictive
    Control has gained interest in the adaptive management of interconnected water
    resources systems, motivated by its capability of incorporating forecasts of evolving
    disturbances into a real-time optimal control scheme. Our comprehensive review
    of 149 peer-reviewed journal articles published in the last 25 years, selected
    after screening an originally more extensive set of 826 papers and checking them
    for eligibility, confirms an overall increasing adoption of MPC in all considered
    inter-connected sub-domains at the basin to urban scale, i.e., water reservoirs,
    open channels, and urban water networks. Despite the differences across these
    three types of systems, some common advantages, drawbacks, trends and challenges
    were identified in relation to MPC applications. In particular, our review identifies
    four main categories of challenges currently limiting most MPC applications in
    the water domain: (i) lack of systematic benchmarking of MPC with respect to other
    control methods and lack of assessment of the MPC performance in relation to the
    characteristics of the physical system; (ii) lack of assessment of the impact
    of uncertainties on the model-based control; (iii) limited analysis of the impact
    of diverse forecast types, resolutions, and prediction horizons; (iv) under-consideration
    of the multi-objective nature of most water resources systems. We argue that future
    MPC applications in water resources systems should focus on addressing these four
    challenges, as key priorities for future developments. Declaration of Competing

    the optimum yield and profitability. Towards such a futuristic method of cultivation,
    this paper proposes a novel method for monitoring the efficient flow of a small

  description: To analyze and study the key control factors of the risk of vault deformation
    in tunnels excavated at small clear distances, a risk assessment method based
    on a pair-copula Bayesian network (PCBN) model is proposed. Based on an analysis
    of the factors affecting the settlement of the vault of an excavated tunnel, an
    index system for the risk assessment of the vault settlement is established. A
    PCBN model based on a pair-copula function and BN can effectively deal with the
    complex risk system and the correlation problems within the risk system. Using
    the constructed PCBN model, a risk analysis of the dome settlement caused by the
    excavation in the Donghu Tuanshan tunnel in Wuhan is carried out, and the risk
    status of the dome settlement of the tunnel is determined to be basically safe.
    It can be determined from this research that a pair-copula correlation concept
    combined with a BN retains the strength of both concepts, and a safety risk analysis
    method for the settlement of tunnel vaults based on the PCBN model is proposed
    to perform real-time and effective safety risk assessment and provide decision
    support for the shield construction stage. Through a correlation analysis of the
    risk indicators of the risk system, it is determined that the risk indicators
    that have the most significant impact on the deformation of the vault are the
    state of the groundwater, the complexity of the construction environment, the
    soil quality of the tunnel arch bottom, and the soil quality of the tunnel vault.
    These risk indicators are used as key risk indicators for decision-making. Based
    on this method, decision-making suggestions for reducing the risk of vault deformation
    are proposed. Good results are achieved in project implementation, and safety
    management of the vault deformation of a small clear excavated tunnel is provided.

    To analyze and study the key control factors of the risk of vault deformation
    in tunnels excavated at small clear distances, a risk assessment method based
    on a pair-copula Bayesian network (PCBN) model is proposed. Based on an analysis
    of the factors affecting the settlement of the vault of an excavated tunnel, an
    index system for the risk assessment of the vault settlement is established. A
    PCBN model based on a pair-copula function and BN can effectively deal with the
    complex risk system and the correlation problems within the risk system. Using
    the constructed PCBN model, a risk analysis of the dome settlement caused by the
    excavation in the Donghu Tuanshan tunnel in Wuhan is carried out, and the risk
    status of the dome settlement of the tunnel is determined to be basically safe.
    It can be determined from this research that a pair-copula correlation concept
    combined with a BN retains the strength of both concepts, and a safety risk analysis
    method for the settlement of tunnel vaults based on the PCBN model is proposed
    to perform real-time and effective safety risk assessment and provide decision
    support for the shield construction stage. Through a correlation analysis of the
    risk indicators of the risk system, it is determined that the risk indicators
    that have the most significant impact on the deformation of the vault are the
    state of the groundwater, the complexity of the construction environment, the
    soil quality of the tunnel arch bottom, and the soil quality of the tunnel vault.
    These risk indicators are used as key risk indicators for decision-making. Based
    on this method, decision-making suggestions for reducing the risk of vault deformation
    are proposed. Good results are achieved in project implementation, and safety
    management of the vault deformation of a small clear excavated tunnel is provided.

    With rapid economic development, cities and densely populated urbanized areas
    face a very large demand for subway facilities [1]. For the construction of urban
    tunnels, a small clear-distance undercut tunnel is a commonly adopted structural
    form. This form has many advantages and can be used for tunnel excavation under
    relatively specific geological conditions [2]. However, during the process of
    tunnel excavation, the excavation machine easily causes the surface of the vault
    to move during engineering excavation [3], producing changes in the displacement
    of the vault, leading to stress concentration [4]. At the same time, as excavation
    continues, the surrounding shear stress will continue to increase [5]. The stress
    of the nearby soil layer changes with the change in the stress until it reaches
    a new equivalent state with the stress and stabilizes [6]. In addition, during
    the construction process, the buried depth of the tunnel, the size of the excavated
    section [7], the construction method and the lining support method can all affect
    the magnitude of the settlement and deformation of the tunnel vault [8]. Therefore,
    real-time dynamic safety assessment and decision-making for the settlement of
    a vault caused by subway tunnel excavation is important for engineering. To ensure
    that subway construction will not cause damage to urban underground pipelines
    and surrounding buildings, thus affecting the normal life of surrounding residents
    [9], many researchers have performed extensive investigations on the prediction
    of settlement deformation caused by subway construction [10]. A survey of the
    related literature shows that existing research is mainly based on the use of
    empirical formulas, centrifugal tests, and numerical analysis to study the impact
    of dome settlement caused by subway tunnel excavation [11]. The empirical formula
    method is simple and practical and was widely used in early research [12]. For
    example, according to the equivalent layering method, Zhou et al. regarded an
    existing tunnel as an equivalent rock stratum and showed a good fit of the empirical
    formula to the measurement data [13]. Based on the defined longitudinal excavation
    coefficient y, the lateral ground settlement of the dynamic prediction model of
    Jiang et al. was established [14]. Tang proposed a modified Peck formula considering
    geological conditions to predict the surface settlement of a double tunnel and
    compared it with the measured data of other cases [10]. However, an empirical
    formula is highly subjective and is only suitable for a rough estimation of surface
    settlement. Many researchers have developed physical models, such as centrifugal
    models, to study the influence of the settlement of the vault caused by tunnel
    excavation. Lei et al. conducted model tests and numerical simulations to investigate
    the ground deformation caused by passing through overlapping tunnels [15]. Shi
    et al. designed and carried out a three-dimensional centrifuge test to study the
    three-dimensional response of the ground and pipeline during the excavation of
    an underlying tunnel and determined the main influencing factors of the tunnel
    excavation on the ground settlement [16]. Qiu et al. used a numerical simulation
    method to analyze the formation deformation evolution law and predicted the formation
    deformation of the model in combination with actual measurements [17]. However,
    centrifugation experiments are time-consuming and costly. With the rapid development
    of computer technology, various numerical simulation analysis methods, such as
    finite element and finite difference methods, have been widely used for tunnel
    construction due to their advantages in analysis and modeling [18]. Yang used
    a 3D numerical simulation to study the deformation characteristics of strata at
    different stages of tunnel excavation and explored the influencing factors to
    ensure the safety of ground traffic and the smooth progress of the project [19].
    Numerical analysis is often carried out using simplifying assumptions for modeling
    analysis and does not take into account the uncertainty of multisource risk factors,
    which is different from the actual situation of a project, so that safety hazards
    during the construction process may not be identified. It is also difficult to
    realize real-time decision-making and security risk control [20]. 2. Literature
    review In recent years, innovation in the computer field has promoted the application
    of artificial intelligence (AI) to all industries [21], and machine learning (ML)
    technology has been widely used for a wide range of civil engineering problems
    [22]. To solve the problem of sustainable building material selection in uncertain
    environments, an integrated multistandard large group decision-making framework
    was developed [23]. Chen developed a new MCGDM bid evaluation method based on
    ELECTRE III, in which the generalized comparison language expression (gcle) is
    used to evaluate the performance of bidders [24]. Liu et al. proposed the standard
    and evaluation index system of the water seepage level, constructed a sample data
    set from the monitoring records for the construction of a random forest model,
    and obtained good results [25]. Some researchers have used artificial neural networks
    (ANNs) [11] and support vector machines (SVMs) [22] to predict the risk of shield
    tunnel vault settlement [26]. Santos studied the settlement of a concrete-supported
    tunnel of São Paulo Metro Line 2 using an artificial neural network and discussed
    the influence of network training parameters on the quality of the results [27].
    Zhang proposed a combination of a wavelet packet transform and least squares support
    vector machine to improve the accuracy and reliability of the ground settlement
    caused by tunnels [9]. However, traditional machine learning methods, such as
    support vector machines and artificial neural networks [28], are inefficient and
    are not sufficiently accurate for analyzing the likelihood of risks in a dynamic
    environment. For example, the support vector product algorithm is difficult to
    implement for large-scale training samples, and it faces difficulties in solving
    multiclassification problems. Artificial neural networks cannot explain their
    reasoning process and the basis for their conclusions, and their theory and learning
    algorithm need to be further improved. Their applications usually do not consider
    the correlation between different indicators [29]. Correlation analysis is a method
    for feature selection in these machine learning techniques [30]. In addition,
    the variance matrix in the ML techniques changes depending on the correlation
    between the variables. To comprehensively consider the uncertainties of multiple
    risk factors and objectively mine the data related to risk factors, more advanced
    methods, such as Bayesian networks (BNs), have been used [31]. BNs have diagnostic
    and predictive analysis capabilities, so that they are widely used in quantitative
    risk analysis [32]. Compared with other methods, some of the advantages of a BN
    are that the cumulative distribution function can perform probabilistic updates
    when new information is available over time [33], realize real-time reasoning
    between network node factors, and better solve uncertainty problems [34]. Risk
    assessment based on a BN model has been widely used in construction projects [35].
    Wu based a BN on the risk assessment of an urban integrated pipe gallery and verified
    the effectiveness of the method [36]. Wang proposed a combination of numerical
    simulations and a BN to quantitatively analyze the factors that cause stratum
    settlement due to shield tunnel construction and analyzed the main parameters
    that affect stratum settlement [37]. Zhou conducted a risk assessment of directly
    buried underground sewer pipes based on BNs [38]. However, traditional BNs are
    more suitable for analyzing discrete node variables, and it is difficult to achieve
    dynamic evaluation of network nodes. Existing hybrid BNs and dynamic BNs can better
    solve continuous node variables and node dynamic probabilities. However, the assumption
    of Gaussian correlation exists in the description of node correlation, and it
    is difficult to construct a nonnormal correlation structure relationship between
    nodes. Copula theory is a theory based on Sklar’s theorem. It uses marginal functions
    to describe the distribution of random variables and copula functions to describe
    the correlation between variables [39]. With the development of computer technology,
    copula theory has been effectively applied in the fields such as finance [40],
    seismology [41], hydrology [42], and meteorology [43]. Copula theory can more
    reasonably evaluate the reliability of complex coupled systems [44]. Therefore,
    some scholars integrate the copula concept into a BN model to realize the dynamic
    risk evaluation of complex systems. To reduce the uncertainty of the length of
    the railway interruption time [45], Hashemi used a copula BN model to perform
    probabilistic safety analysis on the multiprobability of process facilities [46].
    By combining copula functions and BNs, Yu analyzed multiple environmental risk
    indicators of large reservoirs, providing valuable decision support tool for reservoir
    managers and scientists [10]. Pair-copula is a high-dimensional dependency modeling
    method developed on the basis of copula theory. A rattan structure provides a
    feasible and effective modeling method for high-dimensional copula theory. Kurowicka
    et al. applied the pair-copula concept to BNs and obtained a new pair-copula construction
    method, which was defined as a pair-copula BN model (PCBN) [47]. Based on this
    work, this paper conducts risk analysis and qualitative and quantitative correlation
    analysis using an established PCBN model, realizes real-time assessment of shield
    construction risks and identification of key safety control factors, and provides
    decision support for construction safety management. The main research questions
    are as follows: (1) How can a PCBN model be established to carry out an effective
    safety risk assessment of shield construction risks and provide decision-making
    support for it? (2) How can a risk analysis be conducted for the construction
    of a tunnel excavated with a small clear distance? (3) How can the risk factors
    in the shield construction risk evaluation index system be analyzed? This paper
    proposes a risk analysis method based on a pair-copula BN. Based on the measured
    data of the project, the construction risk of a shield tunnel is modeled. Then,
    based on the constructed PCBN model, risk analysis and node correlation analysis
    are carried out to determine the shield construction risk status and the risk
    factors in the risk system that are more relevant to the settlement of the tunnel
    vault. The contributions of this research are as follows: (a) Through a combination
    of pair-copula theory and a BN, based on the measured data, the most marginal
    distribution of risk indicators and the correlation coefficients between the risk
    indicators are determined, and a small net distance that is more suitable for
    an actual project is constructed. The PCBN model of the risk evaluation of the
    construction of an excavated tunnel can obtain more reliable evaluation results.
    (b) Through correlation analysis, the key factors in the risk system that are
    more relevant to the project construction risk are identified. Based on this,
    decision-making suggestions to reduce the construction risk can be proposed, providing
    a basis for the risk control decision. The rest of this paper is organized as
    follows. Section 2 introduces the relevant basic theory of the PCBN model. Section
    3 introduces the step-by-step process based on the PCBN model. Section 4 analyzes
    specific cases. Section 5 discusses protective measures. Section 6 summarizes
    the paper. 3. Methodology 3.1. Pair-copula theory A copula function can be used
    to characterize the correlation between two random variables [48]. The copula
    method is a commonly used method based on Sklar’s theorem to construct a multivariate
    joint distribution model. Sklar’s theorem states that is the joint distribution
    , , …, of a marginal distribution and that there exists for all real n-dimensional
    copulas, , , …,  [49] that can be expressed using formula (1). (1) It is written
    in the form of a joint density function: (2) Based on this idea, by multiplying
    the pair-copula density function of each edge condition probability density function
    of a variable, the multivariate joint distribution density function of the variable
    can be obtained. The specific form is as follows: (3) In the above formula, represents
    a -dimensional vector, is any one of the vectors and . This means that if is removed
    from and the distribution function is restored with the density function (3) ,
    then formula (4) is the result. (4) where is a binary copula function. A Gaussian
    copula can easily construct the dependency relationship to ensure the accuracy
    of the copula function to the original parameter data [50]. An example is provided
    in Fig. 1, which shows the two-dimensional frequency histogram of the data obtained
    using a Gaussian copula function model for simulation. From the probability density
    function graph, it can be intuitively seen that the Gaussian copula function has
    strong tail clustering and exhibits relatively regular tail symmetry. This shows
    that a Gaussian copula function can capture the correlation between random variables
    well. Download : Download high-res image (543KB) Download : Download full-size

    between complex variables in specific problems through directed acyclic graphs
    [51]. It is a network model based on probability theory with strong uncertain
    knowledge expression and reasoning capabilities for any BN [52]. For random variable
    , the corresponding joint probability distribution can be expressed in the following
    form [53]: (5) In formula (5), is the set of parent nodes of random variable in
    period , and represents the period length [47]. If the random variable is a time
    series and the parent node of is ( , …, ), then formula (5) can be transformed
    into formula (6) [54]. (6) 3.3. PCBN model A pair-copula BN relies on the conditional
    independence between a DAG coded variable and uses the conditional probability
    density parameterized by the copula function to connect the nodes of the network
    for continuous data to accurately control the form of the univariate marginal
    distribution and describe the degree of node dependence [55]. Let D = (V, E) denote
    the DAG corresponding to a BN, V is the vertex set, E is the edge set, and D is
    the moral graph of D. Let P denote an absolute continuous probability measure
    on Rd, where d: . Let be a random variable with probability distribution P. If
    the probability density function of P is f and P satisfies the d-Markov property,
    Sklar’s theorem shows that the probability density distribution function (DDF)
    of P can be uniquely decomposed into a series of univariate marginal distributions
    , , …, and a copula function . Bauer [56] proved that copula function can be further
    decomposed into a series of (conditional) pair-copula functions , pa( ), where
    , pa( ). A BN provides the copula with a new type of PCC model, in which each
    (conditional) pair-copula corresponds to an edge in network structure D, connecting
    a node with its parent node. Therefore, the probability density function f of
    P is finally decomposed into Eq. (7): (7) where . This model is called the PCBN
    model. 3.4. PCBN model of interaction risk during the construction of an excavated
    tunnel This paper proposes a pair-copula Bayesian method that combines copula
    functions and BNs to assess the interaction risk during the construction of an
    excavated tunnel. Fig. 2 shows the overall workflow of the proposed risk assessment
    method. It includes three main stages: (1) PCBN model design; (2) risk analysis;
    and (3) correlation analysis. Download : Download high-res image (374KB) Download

    deformation risk assessment model In this paper, a BN model combined with a pair-copula
    function is used to establish a risk assessment model for the vault deformation
    of a small clear-distance undercut tunnel based on the PCBN model. 1. Data preprocessing
    and fitting (1) Data preprocessing ① Data collection Due to the monitoring method
    and technology, the monitored data are abnormal. To solve this problem, the tunnel
    deformation data obtained from monitoring are normalized to reduce the inaccuracy
    of the analysis results caused by abnormal monitoring data, thereby increasing
    the reliability and accuracy of the PCBN model. ② Normalized processing of measured
    data The monitored deformation data from the tunnel construction process are normalized,
    and a risk assessment of the tunnel vault deformation is carried out using formula
    (8). (8) where SD is the result of normalizing the deformation value monitored
    during tunnel construction; OD is the actual deformation value monitored during
    tunnel construction; MX and MN are the maximum and minimum values of the actual
    deformation value, respectively; and d is the confidence interval of the actual
    value of the deformation monitored during the construction of the tunnel. (2)
    Data distribution law fitting ① Alternative optimal marginal distribution function
    The optimal function among the normal, Weibull, gamma, and exponential functions
    that conform to the distribution law of the measured data is selected. The expressions
    and statistical characteristics of the above four functions are shown in Table
    1. ② Determine the optimal distribution function Table 1. Expression and statistical
    characteristics. Function type Normal Weibull Gamma Exponential Expression Variance
    Mean The quality of the risk index evaluation is closely related to the evaluation
    criteria. Due to their simple evaluation and high evaluation effectiveness, the
    Akaike information criterion and Bayes information criterion are the most commonly
    used methods in related scientific research. To ensure the scientific rationality
    of the risk index distribution function and the accuracy of the PCBN model, the
    risk index distribution function in the PCBN model is determined by comparing
    the selection results of the Akaike and Bayes information criteria [57], the measured
    risk index data are adjusted, and the distribution function of the optimal risk
    index limit minimizes the baseline value of the Akaike and Bayesian information.
    The calculation process is shown in formulas (9)–(11): (9) (10) (11) where represents
    the number of the measured data features of the risk index, and represents the
    number of optimal functions. In this paper, is set to 1. 2. Structural design
    of the BN (1) Construction of the tunnel vault deformation risk assessment map:
    Combining the tunnel deformation research results and related monitoring data,
    directional connecting lines are used to connect the parent and child nodes that
    cause the tunnel vault deformation risk indicators to form a directed and acyclic
    risk assessment network; (2) Calculation of the correlation between the indicators:
    According to the corresponding indicator measurement value, formula (12) is used
    to calculate the Spearman correlation coefficient between the risk indicators.
    (12) where is the dimension of all indicator measurement values, and is the ranking
    difference in risk indicator measurement values. 3. Model verification To verify
    the suitability of the pair copula model, it is necessary to verify the fit of
    the constructed pair copula network model. The K-S, A-D and RMSE methods are used
    to calculate the degree of fit of the edge distribution of a node in the copula-Bayes
    network. Formula (13) describes the statistics of the K-S method: (13) where is
    the optimal distribution function of the risk index and is the fitted distribution
    function of the measured value. is substituted into formula (14) to calculate
    the statistical characteristics of the distribution function and test whether
    the sample obeys the selected optimal distribution. (14) Formula (15) expresses
    the root mean square error value (RMSE) of the sample value with total sample
    size and monitoring value : (15) 4. Risk assessment The standardized measurement
    data of the risk indicators are input into the established PCBN model, the risk
    distribution function that meets the qualitative rules is calculated, the digital
    characteristics of the function are calculated and compared with the risk level
    interval, and finally, the vault deformation risk level is determined. 3.4.2.
    Correlation analysis Because previous methods cannot accurately analyze the relationship
    between risk factors, their simulation results are distorted. A pair-copula model
    is used in this paper that can effectively capture the correlation between the
    parameters. Combining BN theory, the accuracy correlation was accurately identified
    and reconstructed. Based on 12 risk indicators in the constructed PCBN model,
    vault deformation was evaluated for risk, and percentile spider graph and other
    analytical methods were used to analyze the common risk factors related to the
    magnitude of the vault deformation in the risk system, and the correlation ranking
    of each index obtained can be used to guide an operation team to focus on the
    more important risk factors. 1. Percentile spider graph Percentile spider graph
    [2] reflects the relationship between various risk indicators and the deformation
    of the vault during tunnel construction and reflects the interrelationship between
    the various factors that affect the deformation of the tunnel vault. 2. Scatter
    chart In this paper, joint distribution scatter diagrams of the risks Ci affecting
    the safety of tunnel construction and the vault deformation risk T during tunnel
    construction are used to determine the risks affecting the safety of tunnel construction
    and the Ci-T correlation of vault deformation during tunnel construction. Through
    the distribution law of the scatter diagram of each risk index and the fitted
    straight line, the largest risk factor affecting the deformation of the tunnel
    vault can be determined. 3. Correlation coefficient Pearson’s digital characteristics
    were used to evaluate the linear correlation between each risk index Ci and the
    vault deformation risk T and to measure whether the relationship was negative
    and significant [58]. A regression coefficient can be used to measure the degree
    of interpretation between two indicators. To address the problem of the nonlinear
    correlation in an unsafe system, Spearman’s coefficient is selected to determine
    whether there exists a linear correlation between the risk index Ci affecting
    the safety of tunnel construction and the vault deformation risk of tunnel construction
    and to determine the sign and significance of the relationship [59]. (1) Pearson
    correlation coefficient [58], [60] The following formula represents the linear
    correlation coefficient of two random variables : (3.24) where is the variance
    of two random variables and expresses the covariance of two random variables .
    (2) Regression coefficient The Pearson correlation coefficient can express the
    linear correlation of two random variables , and the regression coefficient can
    calculate the linear correlation rate of two random variables . The following
    formula represents the calculation expression of the regression coefficient a
    of variable to dependent variable . (3.25) (3) Spearman correlation coefficient
    [59] The Spearman correlation coefficient is usually used to characterize the
    nonlinear correlation between two random variables . The expression for the calculation
    of the Spearman correlation coefficient is shown in the following formula. (3.26)
    where ( , ), ( , ), and ( , ) represent three different independent and identically
    distributed random variables, respectively. The positive and negative correlation
    coefficients of the Spearman rank correlation coefficient are consistent with
    the connection direction of and . In addition, when , it indicates that variable
    is independent of variable . 4. Case study 4.1. Project overview The East Lake
    Passage Project is a key project in Wuhan and is an important part of the regional
    transportation network connecting Hankou and Wuchang. The passage starts from
    the main line viaduct (Hongmiao Interchange) of the Shuidong Section of the Second
    Ring Line, ends at the intersection of Yujiahu Road and Yujiahubei Road, and traverses
    the Donghu Scenic Area. Its length is approximately 9.86 km. The tunnel section
    includes 6.88 km of the East Lake section and a 1.22-km-long Tuanshan section.
    The Tuanshan undercut tunnel is designed as a two-way six-lane tunnel, and the
    distance between the two tunnels is between 10.6 and 16.7 m, which is a small
    clear-distance undercut tunnel, and the maximum tunnel depth is 50 m. In addition,
    the geological conditions along the Tuanshan Tunnel are complex and changeable.
    The V-grade surrounding rock along the entire line accounts for approximately
    70% of the total length of the tunnel. Most of the rocks distributed at the site
    are soluble carbonate rocks. The lake is rich in groundwater and has large reserves
    of karst water. Tunnel excavation is prone to major disasters such as water inrush
    and collapse. Fig. 3 shows the effect of the implementation of Tuanshan’s small

    association model. 4.2. PCBN model construction 1. Establishment of a risk indicator
    system Research and analysis show that aspects of the surrounding rock and soil
    quality, tunnel design [2], construction level and organization management are
    the main factors affecting the deformation of tunnel construction vaults [61].
    Surrounding rock geology X1: the disturbance due to tunnel construction on the
    stress field of the surrounding rock geology cannot be restored to the original
    state in a short time [62], so that the soil stress released during excavation
    will inevitably change the initial geological stress state [63]. The soil quality
    (C1, C2) of the arch top differs strongly from that of the arch bottom, and all
    soil parameters may change in different sections. In addition, the erosion effect
    of the groundwater state (C3) on a tunnel structure will damage the lining concrete,
    particularly the weak parts such as construction joints, thus posing a serious
    threat to the overall quality. Tunnel design X2: since the actual stress distribution
    in the underground surrounding rock state and disturbed soil cannot be accurately
    predicted, it is necessary to adapt the original design plan to ensure the feasibility
    and safety of the construction plan [64]. The stress status of the structure and
    the deformation of the ground surface are affected by the burial depth of the
    tunnel (C4), and the internal force of the structure increases with increasing
    burial depth, threatening the safety of the structure under force [65]. The influence
    of the slope coefficient (C5) on the stress field of the soil is more complicated,
    because it makes the soil uplift or subside to different degrees [2]. In addition,
    choosing a proper cover span ratio (C6) is beneficial for reducing surface deformation
    and stabilizing the safety state of the tunnel structure [10]. Construction level
    X3: The construction method (C7), support construction (C8), and tunneling speed
    (C9) are several common influencing factors that characterize the construction
    level [66]. Different construction methods have different construction characteristics.
    Choosing appropriate construction methods according to the actual situation of
    a specific project is beneficial to reducing ground settlement. Excavation and
    support construction is a key part of preventing tunnel collapse and water leakage.
    Choosing a suitable excavation speed for the project’s working conditions is conducive
    to the formation of the overall stress state in the early stage, as well as for
    improving the safety of the structure [2]. Organizational management (X4): many
    specialties and a large number of personnel are involved in underground engineering
    construction. Establishing an efficient organization and management system is
    an important part of safe construction [67]. The complexity of the construction
    environment (C10) is closely related to engineering risks and has an important
    effect on the status of personnel, construction materials, and construction machinery.
    Since an actual operation process often encounters various emergencies, the experience
    level (C11) of the construction team is highly important for the safety of the
    project. The maturity of construction technology (C12) is a summary of an organization’s
    experience in successfully applying various construction methods to engineering
    cases and is an important factor ensuring the smooth progress of tunnel construction.
    2. PCBN model design and verification In this paper, a long-distance tunnel with
    a small clear distance is taken as an example. In Section 4.2, an evaluation index
    system for the settlement of the tunnel vault was constructed, and the 12 identified
    risk factors were used as the 12 nodes of the BN DAG graph. Combined with expert
    experience and relevant literature data, the DAG chart of risk evaluation is constructed,
    as shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 shows the correlation coefficients between the indicators
    calculated based on the measured data of the 12 indicators comprising the PCBN
    model of the vault deformation risk. The monitoring data are normalized according
    to formula (9), and the AIC and BIC values of each risk indicator for the four
    candidate distributions are calculated according to formulas (10)–(12). According
    to the minimum AIC and BIC value principle, the optimal marginal distribution
    function is determined, and the specific calculation and recognition results are
    shown in Table 2. At the same time, the K-S, A-D and RMSE methods are used to
    test the goodness of fit of the fitted results of the marginal distribution of
    each risk index according to the formula. The significance level is set to . If
    the statistical P value is greater than the significance level, the assumed marginal
    distribution is fitted. By contrast, the assumed marginal distribution is not
    fitted. The final results of the test statistics and P are shown in Table 2. 3.

    on the constructed PCBN model, the subsurface excavated tunnel vault settlement
    risk status can be divided into five risk levels, and the vault settlement risk
    level is mapped to [0, 1] by combining engineering practice and expert experience.
    The intervals correspond to safe, safer, basic safe, generally dangerous, and
    dangerous in order, as shown in Table 3. The average value of the vault deformation
    risk of the small clear-distance excavated tunnel is 0.457, the calculated value
    of the dispersion coefficient is 0.0971, the final maximum value of the vault
    deformation risk is 0.5541, and the minimum value is 0.3599. Combining the calculation
    records and Table 3, it is observed that the vault deformation risk of 0.5541
    corresponds to vault safety level IV, and the vault deformation risk of 0.3599
    corresponds to vault safety level III. It is observed from the safety state classification
    that the vault deformation safety state of the tunnel construction project is
    between the basically safe state and the more dangerous state. To comprehensively
    evaluate the deformation risk of tunnel vault construction, the high-risk factors
    affecting tunnel vault construction are then analyzed to form a comprehensive
    and systematic vault deformation risk system to achieve effective management and
    control of tunnel vault engineering. Table 3. Vault deformation risk grade standard.

    Correlation analysis of indicators 1. Percent spider graph analysis A percentile
    cobweb chart is an effective method for the analysis of the relationship between
    the vault settlement risk value and the influencing factors Xi. In the cobweb
    chart, the abscissa represents each influencing factor, and the ordinate is the
    percentile value point of each factor. Fig. 5 is a percentile spider diagram under
    five risk levels, from which it is observed that the high-probability value and
    low-probability value of the vault deformation risk during the construction of
    the small clear-distance tunnel are related to the tunnel vault and arch bottom.
    Soil quality (C1, C2), groundwater state (C3) and construction environment complexity
    (C10) are related. To further determine the correlation between the vault deformation
    risk during the tunnel construction process and the various factors of the tunnel
    vault, a percentile spider graph of the joint distribution of the parameters under
    conditionalization is used for analysis, and the results are shown in Fig. 6,
    in which the high and low probability values of are conditioned. The high-probability
    value is represented by the blue sample line, and the low-probability value is
    represented by the black sample line. When the risk value is high, C1, C2, C3,
    and C10 values are also high, and are concentrated at the top of the spider graph;
    when the risk value is low, C1, C2, C3, and C10 values are also low, and are concentrated
    at the bottom of the spider graph. It is determined that the risk value has a
    fairly high level of correlation with C1, C2, C3, and C10. Therefore, the above
    indicators are used as the decisive indicators for the risk of tunnel vault deformation.

    of the joint distribution of the parameters under conditionalization. Using the
    updated parameters of the PCBN model of tunnel crown settlement constructed above,
    the joint distribution scatter diagram and fitting curve of each risk index (CI)
    affecting the safety of tunnel construction and the crown settlement risk during
    tunnel construction are drawn to observe the dependency relationship of each risk
    index in the capture risk system, as shown in Fig. 7(a)–(m). According to the
    relevant theory, if the scatter points of the parameter distribution are distributed
    at an oblique 45°angle on the plane formed by X-Y or the slope of the straight
    line fitted by the scatter diagram is larger, it indicates a greater correlation
    between the parameters. Fig. 7(a)–(m) show that the relationships between vault
    settlement risk and risk factors during the construction of small-spacing tunnels
    in the background project differ. Compared with other risk factors, the scattered
    points formed by the vault settlement risk and the groundwater state (C3) factor
    during the construction of the small spacing tunnel are more concentrated, and
    the slope of the fitted straight line is close to 1 (the angle of the line with
    the -axis is 45°), indicating that the vault settlement risk during the tunnel
    construction process is closely related to the groundwater state. The scattered
    distribution formed by the arch crown settlement risk during tunnel construction
    and the “soil at the bottom of the tunnel (C2)” presents a clear oval distribution
    with an incline angle of 45°, demonstrating a strong correlation. The scattered
    distribution of vault settlement risk and “soil quality of tunnel vault (C1)”
    and “complexity of construction environment (C10)” during tunnel construction
    is not as dense as that of vault settlement risk and “soil quality of tunnel bottom
    (C2)” and “groundwater state (C3)” during tunnel construction, but the slope of
    the fitting curve exceeds 45°. This shows that the vault settlement risk in the
    process of tunnel construction is highly correlated with “soil quality of tunnel
    vault (C1)” and “complexity of construction environment (C10)”, but not with “tunnel
    buried depth (C4)”, “longitudinal spacing of tunnel face (C5)”, “tunnel coverage
    ratio (C6)”, “construction method (C7)”, “support and reinforcement method and
    time (C8)”, and “advancing speed of working face (C9)”. The slopes of the fitting
    curves for “construction team experience level (C11)” and “construction technology
    maturity (C12)” are lower than 45°, and in particular, the slopes of the data
    for vault settlement risk plotted versus “tunnel longitudinal spacing (C5)”, “construction
    method (C7)” and “working face advancing speed (C9)” approach 0, showing weak
    correlation. Therefore, according to the scatter diagram analysis of various indicators,
    in this project, the soil quality of the tunnel crown (C1), the soil quality of
    the tunnel bottom (C2), the state of groundwater (C3), and the complexity of the
    construction environment (C10) are the decision-making indicators for reducing
    t-risk, which is consistent with the conclusions obtained from the spider’s Web
    diagram. Download : Download high-res image (3MB) Download : Download full-size

    respect to . Based on the PCBN model constructed in this paper for the vault deformation
    risk of the excavated tunnel, in the calculation of the vault deformation risk
    system, the 12 risk indicators affecting the safety of tunnel construction are
    related using the Pearson correlation coefficient and the regression of the vault
    deformation risk during the tunnel construction process. The calculated values
    of the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Spearman correlation coefficient
    are shown in Fig. 8. The Pearson correlation coefficient is used to measure the
    development trend of the degree of linear correlation between the risk index (Ci)
    and the vault deformation risk by calculating a regression coefficient among the
    risk factors. To obtain the linear correlation slope among the factors, the Spearman
    correlation coefficient among the risk factors is calculated to measure the nonlinear
    correlation between the risk index (Ci) and the vault deformation risk . Table
    4 shows the categories of the significance of correlation based on the correlation
    coefficient used in this article. According to the analysis of the linear and
    nonlinear correlation, C3, C10, and C2 are the most critical risk indicators of
    the risk system. Table 4 and Fig. 8 show that the Pearson coefficients and regression
    coefficients of the top three absolute values are analyzed. Among the 12 indicators
    that affect the risk of tunnel construction vault deformation, the Pearson coefficient
    values of C3, C2 and C10 are 0.7297, 0.5707, and 0.5668, respectively, and are
    all significantly positively correlated. In addition, the maximum value of slope
    a is 5.9080 for C3, indicating that C3 has the greatest correlation with the vault
    deformation risk T. At the same time, the relationship between the main causes
    of vault deformation in tunnel engineering may also be nonlinear. By observing
    and comparing Table 4 and Fig. 8, it is observed that the correlation coefficients
    of the three largest Spearman rank correlation coefficients are C3 and C10, C2,
    with the values of 0.7299, 0.5711, and 0.5672, respectively, all in the range
    of 0.5 to 1, showing significant nonlinear correlation. In summary, C3, C10, and
    C2 are the key risk indicators of the safety system of tunnel construction vault
    deformation. 4. Tail correlation analysis Table 4. The relationship between the

    upper tail correlation estimation diagram. In tunnel engineering, when the risk
    value of vault settlement is large, the upper tail correlation of the risk index
    measures the impact of the changes in 12 risk indexes in the tunnel construction
    risk system on the risk value of the vault structure. A higher upper tail correlation
    corresponds to a higher risk of tunnel vault formation. In tunnel engineering,
    changing the risk index will cause significant changes in the risk value of the
    arch crown structure. Since the change risk of each risk index affecting the safety
    of tunnel construction at a higher value is far greater than its risk in other
    value ranges, the upper tail correlation index between each risk index affecting
    the safety of tunnel construction and the risk of vault settlement during tunnel
    construction has a strong correlation with the risk management of vault settlement
    caused by tunnel construction. To determine the maximum upper tail phase value
    of each risk index, with the change in the value of the vault settlement factor
    (CI) affecting the tunnel construction process, the change in the upper tail phase
    value of each risk index (CI) affecting the safety of tunnel construction and
    the vault settlement risk during tunnel construction are fit. The corresponding
    upper tail correlation estimation diagrams of each risk index (CI) affecting the
    safety of tunnel construction and the vault settlement risk during tunnel construction
    are drawn, as shown in Fig. 9(a)–(m), respectively. According to Fig. 9, despite
    the differences in the upper tail correlation coefficient between each risk index
    (CI) affecting the safety of tunnel construction and the crown settlement risk
    during tunnel construction, the same change trends are observed; that is, the
    value of the crown settlement factor (CI) during tunnel construction is positively
    correlated with the upper tail correlation coefficient, but there are differences
    in the growth range and growth mode. In particular, the crown settlement risk
    during tunnel construction increases nearly linearly with the soil quality of
    the tunnel crown (C1), the soil quality of the tunnel bottom (C2), the tunnel
    buried depth (C4) and the tunnel coverage ratio (C6), while other indicators show
    a non-linear increase. Moreover, the vault settlement risk during tunnel construction
    and the soil quality (C1) of the tunnel vault, the soil quality (C2) of the tunnel
    bottom, the groundwater state (C3) and the complexity of the construction environment
    (C10) show very pronounced increasing trends. These results show that in practical
    engineering, when the vault settlement risk t of the underground tunnel is high,
    the risk indicators are the soil quality (C1) of the tunnel vault, the soil quality
    (C2) of the tunnel bottom, and the groundwater state (C3). The increase in the
    complexity of the construction environment (C10) will lead to a significant increase
    in the risk of vault settlement during tunnel construction. Conversely, the reduction
    in the risk indicators soil quality of the tunnel vault (C1), soil quality of
    the tunnel bottom (C2), groundwater state (C3) and complexity of the construction
    environment (C10) will lead to a significant reduction in the risk of vault settlement
    during tunnel construction. Fig. 9 shows that among the risk indicators with a
    larger increasing trend, namely the soil quality of the tunnel crown (C1), the
    soil quality of the tunnel bottom (C2), the groundwater state (C3) and the complexity
    of the construction environment (C10), the maximum result of the upper tail correlation
    coefficient is the maximum value of the upper tail correlation curve in Fig. 9(k),
    that is, the upper tail correlation between the crown settlement risk during tunnel
    construction and the complexity of the construction environment (C10). The second
    largest results are presented in Fig. 9(a)–(c), the maximum values of the upper
    tail correlation curves, that is, the upper tail correlations between the crown
    settlement risk during tunnel construction and the soil quality of the tunnel
    crown (C1), the soil quality of the tunnel bottom (C2), and the groundwater state
    C3. This shows that when the crown settlement risk t in the process of tunnel
    construction is high, reducing the soil quality of the tunnel crown (C1), soil
    quality of the tunnel bottom (C2), groundwater state (C3) and complexity of the
    construction environment (C10) sequentially can effectively control the risk t
    caused by tunnel crown settlement in the process of tunnel construction. In the
    process of tunnel construction, combined with the measured values of on-site tunnel
    deformation monitoring, when it is found that the risk value of vault settlement
    is large, priority should be given to the risk of reducing the construction environment
    complexity (C10), which is the index with the greatest dependence on the top and
    tail of the vault settlement risk t in the process of tunnel construction, to
    effectively reduce the risk of vault settlement. If the risk of construction environment
    complexity (C10) of the project is low, the risk of groundwater state (C3), soil
    quality of the tunnel crown (C1) and soil quality of the tunnel bottom (C2) should
    be reduced to reduce the risk of tunnel crown settlement. Download : Download

    under different types of data. 5. Discussion 5.1. Ci-t correlation under different
    types of data By determining the best fitting marginal distribution, the PCBN
    model can effectively capture the correlation between the variables in the risk
    analysis of actual tunnel crown settlement. Compared with discrete data, continuous
    data can better reflect the characteristics and laws of data. The difference in
    the marginal distribution types of variables will affect the construction of the
    PCBN model and then will affect the results of risk analysis. This case uses the
    normal, Weibull, gamma and exponential distributions as alternative distribution
    functions to fit the characteristics of 12 risk factors. Now, 12 risk factors
    are considered as discrete data. By comparing the correlation between and each
    risk factor CI under two different types of data, as shown in Fig. 10, the following
    conclusions can be obtained. Different marginal distribution types of the variables
    will affect the specific value of the correlation coefficient that determines
    the accuracy of the model. However, from the qualitative point of view, the dependencies
    between the variables have not changed significantly. The Spearman correlation
    coefficient in Fig. 10 is used to show the correlation strength between the variables.
    For both discrete data and continuous data, the overall trend of the change of
    the correlation coefficient among the variables is roughly the same. However,
    the correlation value of the discrete data variable is slightly higher than that
    of the continuous data variable, indicating that the model established by the
    discrete data distribution variable slightly overestimates the relevant risk intensity.
    Therefore, it is necessary to verify the marginal distribution type of each variable
    in the PCBN model in order to more accurately measure the correlation between
    the variables and more effectively provide support for the risk analysis of tunnel
    crown settlement. 5.2. Risk analysis results and control measures (1) Based on
    the spider web diagram, scatter diagram, correlation coefficient and upper tail
    correlation analysis results, it is shown that the risk indicators that are highly
    correlated with the vault settlement risk are the key risk indicators in the vault
    settlement risk system of underground excavation tunnels, namely, the soil quality
    of the tunnel vault (C1), the soil quality of the tunnel bottom C2, the groundwater
    state (C3), and the complexity of the construction environment (C10). According
    to the calculated correlation coefficients, the order of correlation is groundwater
    state (C3), complexity of construction environment (C10), soil quality at the
    bottom of the tunnel (C2), and soil quality at the top of the tunnel (C1); 1)
    According to the upper tail correlation analysis results, the order of correlation
    is the complexity of the construction environment (C10), the state of groundwater
    (C3), the soil quality of the tunnel vault (C1), and the soil quality of the tunnel
    bottom (C2). 2) Based on the analysis and suggestions of PCBN, the goal of effectively
    reducing the risk of tunnel vault settlement in the process of tunnel construction
    is achieved by controlling the risk of vault settlement more effectively when
    such risk is high. Effective drainage measures (as shown in Fig. 11) can be adopted
    to reduce the risk caused by groundwater. The stratum with poor geological conditions
    should be reinforced by small conduit grouting (as shown in Fig. 12). For large-span
    and small-spacing tunnels, to reduce the excessive settlement of the arch crown,
    a temporary inverted arch and temporary steel arch of the middle diaphragm should
    be added during the tunnel excavation in order to reduce construction safety risks
    (as shown in Fig. 13). When the left and right tunnels are constructed simultaneously,
    to reduce the settlement risk due to the mutual influence of the tunnels in the
    process of simultaneous excavation, the excavations of the left and right tunnels
    must be at least 50 m apart (as shown in Fig. 14). After the initial lining of
    the tunnel is completed, the construction of the tunnel invert and secondary lining
    must be carried out promptly to achieve the stability of the tunnel excavation
    section structure and ensure that the construction risk of the tunnel vault workshop
    is minimized (as shown in Fig. 15, Fig. 16). The adoption of this series of measures
    has effectively reduced the risk of vault settlement of small spacing tunnels
    and has achieved good results. Download : Download high-res image (272KB) Download

    To address vault deformation that has a strong impact on the safety risk of undercut
    tunnel construction, this paper adopts a Bayesian model combined with a copular
    function to establish a risk index system, designs a Bayesian-copula model (PCBN),
    and performs model analysis in three steps. The highest deformation risk is evaluated.
    Then, the proposed PCBN model is applied to a small clear-distance undercut tunnel
    project in Tuanshan Donghu, Wuhan, and effective assessment and decision-making
    of the vault deformation risk are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the
    method. The conclusions of this case study are as follows: (1) The optimal marginal
    distribution and numerical characteristics of each risk indicator are determined
    using the measured data based on the copula function, the correlation coefficient
    characteristics of each risk indicator and the vault deformation risk are calculated,
    and then the BN is used according to the correlation to enable intelligent decision-making
    regarding the risk of tunnel construction vault deformation. (2) After the construction
    of the PCBN model, the vault deformation risk and risk indicators are analyzed
    based on a cobweb diagram, scatter diagram, and the correlation coefficients,
    and the key risk indicators that are more strongly related to the vault deformation
    risk are found to include groundwater, the soil quality of the vault and the bottom
    of the arch, and the complexity of the construction environment. (3) In view of
    the key risk factors, it is recommended to adopt effective waterproofing and drainage
    measures to reduce the risk of groundwater and reduce the complexity of the tunnel
    construction environment to reduce the risk of vault deformation. Based on the
    PCBN model analysis and the actual project situation, the proposed targeted suggestions
    achieved good results with project implementation. It must be pointed out that
    the research described in this article has certain limitations. Although some
    multifaceted characteristic parameters have been collected, they are still not
    comprehensive in terms of personnel, machinery and equipment, and materials. This
    affects the construction of the PCBN model, and other risk factors need to be
    considered in the future to establish a more complete indicator system. In addition,
    the case used in this paper is for Wuhan geology, whereas many different geological
    conditions are encountered in the subway tunnels built in China, such as the karst
    cave landform of Guizhou Metro Line 3. The total number of samples used in this
    paper is limited, and the research results will be limited by the number of samples.
    Therefore, it is necessary to consider other risk factors and establish a more
    complete index system in the future. In the future, this method page will be applied
    to tunnel construction safety risk assessment for additional different geological
    types. CRediT authorship contribution statement Xianguo Wu: Methodology, Investigation,

  description: Water has always been a driver of human civilization. The first human
    civilizations thrived in places with an abundance of water, typically nearby large
    rivers as the Tigris–Euphrates, Yang Che and Nile. The invention and construction
    of hydraulic infrastructure came only later, in prehistoric times, triggered by
    the expansion of humanity in water-scarce areas. The ancient Greeks invented impressive
    hydraulic works and small-scale structures, some of which, such as cisterns, were
    still fully operational until the 20th century. We present a model that explains
    the use of cisterns in the water-scarce area of West Mani, which allows us to
    assess the potential of this traditional rainfall harvesting practice to support
    the modern water supply needs. To assess the system’s reliability, we employ a
    long-term simulation of a typical cistern system, using synthetic rainfall series
    from a stochastic model, and assuming variable water demand on a monthly scale.
    We show that a proper restoration of the cisterns could be sustainable as a complementary
    water supply source, decreasing the area’s drinking water cost and increasing
    the locals’ resilience against water shortages. In addition, we highlight the
    links between the area’s hydroclimate and its history and discuss the cultural
    merits of reviving and preserving this centuries-long practice.

    The first human civilizations thrived in places with an abundance of water, typically
    nearby large rivers as the Tigris–Euphrates, Yang Che and Nile. The invention
    and construction of hydraulic infrastructure came only later, in prehistoric times,
    triggered by the expansion of humanity in water-scarce areas. The ancient Greeks
    invented impressive hydraulic works and small-scale structures, some of which,
    such as cisterns, were still fully operational until the 20th century. We present
    a model that explains the use of cisterns in the water-scarce area of West Mani,
    which allows us to assess the potential of this traditional rainfall harvesting
    practice to support the modern water supply needs. To assess the system’s reliability,
    we employ a long-term simulation of a typical cistern system, using synthetic
    rainfall series from a stochastic model, and assuming variable water demand on
    a monthly scale. We show that a proper restoration of the cisterns could be sustainable
    as a complementary water supply source, decreasing the area’s drinking water cost
    and increasing the locals’ resilience against water shortages. In addition, we

    Water, as one of the three critical elements in the water–energy–food (WEF) nexus,
    has always been a driving force of human civilization [1,2]. The importance of
    the WEF nexus for social stability and social cohesion was recently highlighted
    by Sargentis et al. [3] The authors show that although every part of the nexus
    contributes to increased life expectancy (a prerequisite for societal prosperity),
    it suffices for one of the nexus’ parts to be missing to produce social instability
    and crisis. This explains why since antiquity human civilizations strived to improve
    living conditions depending on all three aspects of the WEF, achieving great progress
    from standards that we would now consider as extreme poverty [3]. Some of the
    related technological advances, such as the agricultural revolution, were global,
    while others (e.g., hydraulic infrastructure) covered mostly local needs. In every
    case, however, the optimization of the WEF nexus was the running paradigm for
    societies’ growth [4,5,6,7,8,9]. The area of West Mani is located in the southern
    part of Greece in the Peloponnese and comprises the northwestern part of the Mani
    region, also known as Outer/Messinian Mani (Figure 1a). The region has a high
    rate of precipitation mainly in the mountainous areas. Rainfall is mostly observed
    during the autumn and winter months, from September to March, while there is significant
    decrease in the summer. The geological background is extremely permeable as it
    consists mainly of karstic limestone (Figure 1b), which is typical of the Taygetos
    mountain [10]. Therefore, only few springs are traced, while the groundwater table
    is too low to be efficiently exploited by wells, and groundwater mostly outflows
    to submarine springs. Still, the area has an advantageous location and excellent
    climatic conditions for human prosperity, and thus, despite the limited surface
    water resources, it has a long history of inhabitance since the archaic era [11].
    Figure 1. (a) Location of West Mani in Greece; (b) hydrological cycle where water
    is lost by the permeable geological background in West Mani; (c,d) views of abandoned
    cisterns in the Lagadas region. Due to the extremely permeable background and
    the mountainous topography, the surface water resources have always been scarce,
    forcing locals to find ways to harness and store rainwater. Generally, central
    and eastern Greece suffers from limited water availability and, since prehistory,
    Greeks have developed hydraulic technology and water management practices to tackle
    this issue [12,13,14,15,16,17]. For instance, methods like cisterns (in modern
    Greek στέρνες; Figure 1c) [18] or a process of groundwater capture (in Greek called
    υδρομάστευση) [19] have been used since antiquity for the water supply of the
    urban areas and villages. However, in the present-day, the majority of the cisterns
    have been either abandoned or are not functional (e.g., Figure 1c). The cistern
    is an underground tank with volumes between a typical range of 5 and 55 m3 [20]
    that stores rainwater collected on the roofs of house complexes [21]. Different
    typologies of a cistern can be found in the wider area of Messinia across the
    centuries (e.g., ancient Greek, Byzantine, Ottoman, Frankish) [22], but here,
    we refer to the domestic-scale cistern, usually an underground structure that
    was in wide use during the 19th century in the area West Mani [22,23]. A cross-section
    of a traditional tower-house complex with a cistern, illustrating the function
    of the latter, is presented in Figure 2. This small-scale infrastructure was the
    basic water source for the local society [24] until the last century [25]. Figure
    2. Cross-section of a typical traditional tower-house complex with its cistern
    in West Mani. In order to model the cisterns’ function as a water supply, we present
    in Section 2 a long-term simulation of the cistern system based on a stochastic
    model of monthly rainfall, reproducing the area’s rainfall key statistical properties.
    In Section 3, we estimate the reliability of the water supply system and identify
    the systems’ failures, whereas in Section 4, preceding the conclusions, we discuss
    and highlight the cultural heritage of the area and its links to the water availability
    characteristics. 2. Simulating at-Site Monthly Rainfall Using a Stochastic Approach
    The cistern’s function relies on the rainfall process, which due to limited at-site
    data, and in order to account for the enriched variability of climatic conditions,
    herein is modeled via a stochastic approach. The closest meteorological station
    of Kardamyli [26] in West Mani has only 8 years of rainfall data (2014–2021),
    which are considered generally insufficient for the estimation of rainfall’s long-term
    stochastic properties. Therefore, we employ the second closest available meteorological
    station of Kalamata, the rainfall time series of which span 68 years (1951–2018)
    of data recorded at approximately the same altitude (13 m) [27]. We find a good
    agreement between the monthly averages of the two stations (Figure 3), and therefore,
    we employ Kalamata’s station for the rest of the analysis, by assuming a similar
    rainfall regime between the two regions. Figure 3. Monthly average of rainfall
    depths in Kardamyli and Kalamata stations. An important stochastic property of
    various natural processes is their large long-term variability, known as Hurst–Kolmogorov
    (HK) dynamics, or else long-range dependence or long-term persistence (LTP) [28].
    This behavior of natural systems was first identified in nature by H.E. Hurst
    in 1951, while working at the river Nile, although its mathematical description
    is attributed to A.N. Kolmogorov, who developed it while studying turbulence in
    1940. Koutsoyiannis named this behavior Hurst–Kolmogorov dynamics (HK) to give
    credit to both pioneering scientists [29]. Interestingly, this behavior has been
    identified in key hydrological-cycle processes at a global scale through the analysis
    of thousands of stations [30]. Although in HK dynamics the marginal distribution
    of the process may be arbitrary, the most commonly used distribution is the Gaussian
    one, which results in the well-known fractional Gaussian noise described by Mandelbrot
    and van Ness [31], i.e., the power-law decay of variance as a function of scale
    𝛾(𝑘) [32]. The HK behavior is quantified by the Hurst parameter H (0 < H < 1).
    In the simplest case, the variance 𝛾(𝑘)  of the process at timescale k, known
    as the climacogram, is given by 𝛾(𝑘)= 𝜆 (𝑘/𝛥) 2(1−𝐻) (1) where 𝛥 is a characteristic
    timescale and 𝜆 is the variance at this timescale. For 0 < H < 0.5 the HK process
    exhibits an anti-persistent behavior, H = 0.5 corresponds to the white noise process,
    and for 0.5 < H < 1 the process exhibits LTP (i.e., a clustering behavior). In
    order to account for a natural behavior deviating from a simple white-noise process
    (i.e., independence among successive values of the process), we simulate the rainfall
    using a stochastic model reproducing the HK dynamics. To this aim, we first estimate
    the H parameter through the climacogram and find that the HK behavior is apparent
    at the largest scales, as expected (Figure 4). The H parameter, considering the
    range of scales k = 36–81, is estimated H = 0.6, while considering the range k
    = 48–81 it increases to H = 0.7. It is noted that there seems to be a small drop
    of the variance expanding from the small scales to around 3 years, a known behaviour
    documented in rainfall stochastic analyses in the literature [33]. Figure 4. Climacogram
    of the standardized monthly rainfall series and estimated H parameters based on
    the yearly (k = 12–81) series (green), series of scales k = 36–81 (blue) and of
    scales k = 48–81 (red). Based on these analyses, we employ the value of H = 0.65,
    also considering that it is a value in accordance with global analyses of rainfall
    [34]. To model the marginal distribution of the monthly rainfall we use the gamma
    distribution, which showed a good agreement with the empirical data (Figure 5a).
    Both the marginal distribution and the identified dependence structure are reproduced
    through a stochastic synthesis algorithm, and particularly through the symmetric-moving-average
    (SMA) scheme [35], an established method to simulate hydrological processes as
    rainfall. We note, however, that more sophisticated schemes exist if one aims
    for greater accuracy and capturing of finer-scale behaviors [36]. Rainfall seasonality
    is preserved through a linear standardization procedure, i.e., subtracting from
    each month its monthly mean and dividing by its monthly standard deviation, and
    at the end, is recovered by the reverse procedure. Figure 5b shows the synthetic
    timeseries sharing the above stochastic properties with the historical [37]. Figure
    5. (a) Empirical (red) vs. gamma (blue) cumulative distribution functions for
    monthly rainfall at Kalamata. (b) Historic (68 years; red) vs. synthetic (500
    years; blue) monthly rainfall time series for the station of Kalamata. 3. A Toy
    Model of the Cistern Since ancient times, people developed a practical understanding
    of nature’s long-term variability and identified the need to store their water
    resources when there was abundance thereof, in order to use them when there was
    scarcity [38,39,40,41]. The first written reference of this concept was recorded
    in the Bible, where Joseph advised the Pharaoh to store the food in wealthy years,
    as he predicted that dry years would come [42]. This is the reason why LTP is
    also known as the Joseph effect [43]. In our model, we assume that ten people
    live in a traditional house complex. The annual water demand is assumed fixed
    for a given simulation, while the monthly demand is periodically varying, increasing
    in the summer months and decreasing in the winter months (Figure 6a). The inflows
    to the cistern are collected at the roofs of the house complex, comprising an
    area of around 100 m2. We assume that a percentage of the rainwater as high as
    90% enters into the cistern. The lower threshold for drinking water supply for
    the modern standard of living is assumed at 5 L per capita per day, i.e., 1.5
    m3 per house complex (10 people) per month. We also assume a maximum capacity
    of the cistern to be 20 m3. Figure 6. (a) Percentage of the annual demand for
    each month; (b) the volume function of the cistern based on average rainfall inflows.
    The water storage and withdrawal processes are modeled by the following equations:
    𝑆      𝑇 =max(0,min(𝐾, 𝑆      𝑇−1 + 𝑥 ̲ 𝑇 − 𝑅        𝑇 ) (2) 𝑅
          𝑇 =max(0,min( 𝑎 𝑇 𝐷,  𝑆      𝑇−1 + 𝑥 ̲ 𝑇 ) (3) where T denotes
    time; 𝑆      𝑇 is the storage in the cistern; 𝑥 ̲ 𝑇 is the rainfall inflow;
    𝑅       𝑇 is the water withdrawal (consumption) dependent on the annual
    demand 𝐷 and 𝑎 𝑇 is a set of 12 coefficients periodically varying with time (Figure
    6a); and K is the storage capacity, here assumed 20 m3 [43]. An example of the
    average monthly function of one cistern’s storage volume with an annual demand
    of 𝐷=36  m 3 is presented in Figure 6b. We define and study the probability of
    two different types of failure for the system: (a) the cistern’s soft failure,
    defined as the probability of not meeting the entirety of the users’ demand per
    month, and (b) the cistern’s hard failure, defined as the probability of not meeting
    the minimum of the users’ monthly demand for survival (here, estimated as 1.5
    m3). Based on the above, we analyze the system’s performance for three different
    scenarios of annual demand 𝐷 : for 𝐷=36  m 3 the average consumption is 3 m3 per
    month, the system’s soft failure is 0.08%, while its hard failure is 0.02% (Figure
    7); for 𝐷=54  m 3 the average consumption is 4.4 m3 per month, the system’s soft
    failure is 3.17%, while its hard failure is 0.88% (Figure 8); for 𝐷=72  m 3 the
    average consumption is 5.6 m3 per month, the system’s soft failure is 9.8%, while
    its hard failure is 3.13% (Figure 9). Figure 7. An example of a simulation with
    annual demand 𝐷=36  m 3 , corresponding to average monthly consumption of 3  m
    3 and with a hard failure estimated as 0.02%. Figure 8. An example of a simulation
    with annual demand 𝐷=54  m 3 , corresponding to average monthly consumption of
    4.4  m 3 and with a hard failure estimated as 0.88%. Figure 9. An example of a
    simulation with annual demand 𝐷=72  m 3 , corresponding to average monthly consumption
    of 5.6  m 3 and with a hard failure estimated as 3.13%. It is evident that the
    system’s reliability is very sensitive to changes in demand, which, of course,
    is an expected attribute of small-scale infrastructure systems [44]. It is therefore
    clear that neither the modern way of living nor future growth could be supported
    by such a system alone. Yet despite the sharp increase in both hard and soft failure
    for increasing demand, the hard failure rate remains at acceptable levels for
    all three cases. The latter suggests that the cisterns’ revival as a complementary
    backup water system could be a sustainable strategy for the future. It could also
    positively contribute to the survival and growth of the local communities, by
    reducing the drinking water cost (now covered by the purchase of bottled water)
    while increasing the locals’ resilience against possible failures of the central
    water-supply system [45]. Nonetheless, the architecture of cisterns is well-suited
    to the local landscape, while their historic and cultural elements, which are
    discussed next, highilight and promote the cultural heritage of the area. 4. Discussion
    Water is the most precious resource for human life, and its availability shapes
    both the way of living and the cultural traits of local communities. The availability
    of water resources in West Mani has been extremely limited and documented as such
    in various historical archives; e.g., Adamakopoulos notes [46]: “The bare landscape
    and barren lands of Mani, would be less harsh to humans if this place had even
    sporadically, a spring or a stream. Made of the same permeable limestone, the
    mountains of Mani cursed people to beg for the mercy of the sky. Apart from Avia
    and a part of the Kardamili area, many villages of Exo (Outer) Mani and whole
    Mesa (Inner) Mani, lived with the anticipation of the rain and the measurement
    of the level of the cistern.” (translated from the Greek original) Indeed, until
    the 19th century the cistern was the basic source of drinking water in the Mani
    Peninsula and also supported the development of domestic-scale livestock and agriculture
    [22,23,47]. However, some other small-scale water infrastructure can also be found
    in the area, such as drinking water fountains utilizing natural springs of very
    small flows and small stone-lined ponds, which harvested rainwater for irrigation
    purposes [21]. Still, water scarcity remained pronounced in the area and contributed,
    among other adverse factors, to cultivating a renowned fierce character of the
    inhabitants and a “fighting” culture, even among themselves [48]. Not surprisingly,
    inhabitants of West Mani played a key role in starting the Greek Revolution in
    1821 [24,47,49,50]. The previous analyses show that a cistern could support the
    drinking water needs for about 10 people with a simple way of living. However,
    the consumption of water in preindustrial eras was mostly dominated by drinking
    water consumption, which (depending on the season) is about 2–5 L per day [51].
    In modern times, this daily average consumption is greatly increased, as a modern
    way of living requires a minimum of 50–150 L per day [52]. Considering that the
    area of West Mani has evolved into an attractive tourist destination and a lot
    of tourist infrastructures have installed water pools, we assume that the daily
    consumption per capita can be estimated to be at least 250–350 L. In the last
    50 years, modern borehole infrastructures have been installed in the area in order
    to cover the water needs by extracting groundwater, albeit with low water quality
    [53]. As a result, inhabitants and tourists are still advised to drink only bottled
    water, which typically costs about 1 €/L. Other technical solutions that have
    been proposed are not expected to result in better water quality and mostly aim
    to only partially address the problem of limited quantity [54,55]. In this light,
    a proper restoration of the cisterns [56] could give an important supply of drinking
    water to the locals. It is important to note that, according to the model, after
    a proper restoration, a cistern of 20 m3 could provide as much as 36,000 L of
    drinking water per year. At the same time, it is worth noting that the cistern,
    as a domestic-scale underground water tank, is a low-cost construction, fully
    integrated into the local landscape. From a cultural perspective, the cisterns
    constitute an important element of West Mani’s traditional architecture [57],
    which is highly valued by modern-day visitors [58]. They also point to an essential
    part of the local history, representing the striving for water from antiquity
    to the 20th century. A restoration thereof, apart from contributing to the water
    supply an important source of drinking water, could reconnect the locals to a
    more sustainable way of living, improving their resilience under future water
    shortages. Restored cisterns could act as a modern reminder of the adversely dry
    climate and the human struggle for survival in the area, both of which shape the
    area’s unique cultural heritage. 5. Conclusions We evaluate the water supply operation
    of the traditional rainwater harvesting practice of cisterns in West Mani, one
    of Greece’s areas with a pronounced water shortage. A simple water management
    assessment using rainfall stochastic simulation and a toy model for the cistern
    operation shows that even though cisterns alone cannot support the modern way
    of living, their function could still efficiently complement the existing water
    supply system, even if it is re-evaluated with economic criteria. Indeed, the
    cisterns could be an important low-cost and backup source of drinking water that
    would reduce the drinking water cost in the area. At the same time, the cisterns’
    operation as a domestic practice would cultivate the locals’ awareness of the
    limited water resources and their dynamics, also increasing their resilience under
    future water shortages. From a historical investigation, it becomes apparent that
    the cistern was a crucial means for survival of the local societies against water
    shortage, which formulated the culture and ethos of the area’s inhabitants. In
    fact, major events of the history of Greece can be linked to this quest for water
    in West Mani. Therefore, cisterns, aside from a sustainable practice of water
    supply, are shown to be an important element of West Mani’s unique cultural heritage.

  description: Soft computing (SC) methods have increasingly been used to solve complex
    hydraulic engineering problems, especially those characterized by high uncertainty.
    SC approaches have previously proved to be an accurate tool for predicting the
    aeration efficiency coefficient (E20) in hydraulic structures such as weirs and

    (SVR) algorithm and three of its hybrid versions, support vector regression–firefly
    algorithm (SVR-FA), support vector regression–grasshopper optimization algorithm
    (SVR-GOA), and support vector regression–artificial bee colony (SVR-ABC), is assessed
    for the prediction of E20 in stepped cascades. Mutual information theory is used
    to construct input variable combinations for prediction, including the parameters
    unit discharge (q), the total number of steps (N), step height (h), chute overall
    length (L), and chute inclination (α). Entropy indicators, such as maximum likelihood,
    Jeffrey, Laplace, Schurmann–Grassberger, and minimax, are computed to quantify
    the epistemic uncertainty associated with the models. Four indices—correlation
    coefficient (R), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), root mean square error (RMSE),
    and mean absolute error (MAE)—are employed for evaluating the models’ prediction
    performance. The models’ outputs reveal that the SVR-FA model (with R=0.947,NSE=0.888,RMSE=0.048andMAE=0.027
    in testing phase) has the best performance among all the models considered. The
    input variable combination, including q, N, h, and L, provides the best predictions
    with the SVR, SVR-FA, and SVR-GOA models. From the uncertainty analysis, the SVR-FA
    model shows the closest entropy values to the observed ones (3.630 vs. 3.628 for
    the “classic” entropy method and 3.647 vs. 3.643 on average for the Bayesian entropy
    method). This study proves that SC algorithms can be highly accurate in simulating
    aeration efficiency in stepped cascades and provide a valid alternative to the
    traditional empirical equation.

    14 June 2023 1 Introduction Stepped cascades have many applications in river engineering,
    as dam structures or aeration cascades. They generally are efficient aeration
    structures based on air bubble entrainment, large residence time, and significant
    turbulent mixing (Toombes and Chanson 2020), with aeration being a physical process
    (Baylar et al. 2007c) that brings water and air in close contact to increase the
    amount of Dissolved Oxygen (DO) (Izadi et al. 2021). Aeration cascades in waterways
    (Baylar et al. 2009) are common in water treatment (Baylar et al. 2007c; Hanbay
    et al. 2009a) for re-oxygenation and chlorine elimination (Baylar et al. 2010),
    denitrification and volatile organic compound removal (Baylar et al. 2007c), and
    volatile organic compounds stripping (Toombes and Chanson 2005). Stepped cascades
    have been used for a long time, at least for the last 3500 years, since in Roman
    settlements, stepped cascades were used to prevent erosion and damage to dams
    (Chanson 2000). In relatively recent times, this kind of structure has been progressively
    abandoned (Felder and Chanson 2009) until the 1980s, with the development of new
    and efficient construction techniques that boosted the use of these structures
    (Jiang et al. 2018, Salmasi et al. 2021). As energy dissipators, stepped cascades
    have multiple advantages: reduction in the required depth and size of the stilling
    basins (Peyras et al. 1992), significant energy loss rate, and compatibility with
    roller-compacted concrete (RCC) dams (Sengun et al. 2021). The flow regime on
    stepped cascades is classified into three types: nappe flow, transition flow,
    and skimming flow (Salmasi et al. 2021). Nappe flow is characterized by a series
    of free-falling nappes plunging from one step to the next and is typical of low
    discharges (Toombes and Chanson 2008). As the flow rate increases, the nappe impact
    near the steps disappears, creating a situation similar to stagnation. This regime,
    called transition flow, is characterized by significant aeration, water splashing,
    and chaotic appearance, with the flow characteristics varying from step to step.
    For even larger discharge, skimming flow is established: The nappe impact caused
    by the spillway disappears completely, and the water flows as a stream over the
    pseudo-bottom. Many studies were carried out to investigate various aspects of
    aeration and stepped cascades, most of them via experiments. Gameson (1957) was
    the first to research aeration by stepped cascades and the use of weirs to accelerate
    the aeration process; (Tebbutt 1972) measured the aeration efficiency in a laboratory
    stepped cascade; (Essery et al. 1978) proposed a formulation to predict the aeration
    efficiency of cascades for discharges between 1.5 L per second and 22 L per second,
    with step heights between 0.025 and 0.5 m; (Toombes and Chanson 2005) studied
    the oxygenation on a stepped cascade with low chute slope and for high discharges
    between 19 and 300 L per second. In recent years, different research groups (Baylar
    et al. 2007a, 2006; b, c; Baylar and Emiroglu 2003; Emiroglu and Baylar 2003;
    Hanbay et al. 2009b, 2009a) have performed a number of water aeration experiments
    on laboratory stepped cascades. Although these research groups expressed oxygenation
    with various correlations, it should be noted that these correlations are purely
    empirical, which may therefore ignore the effect of some important parameters
    and may be applicable for a limited number of conditions (Khdhiri et al. 2014).
    In recent years, advances have been made in developing and applying soft computing
    (SC) methods in engineering. These methods have been utilized in previous studies
    of hydraulic structures and have shown high performance in simulating discharge
    coefficient in a stepped morning glory spillway (Haghbin et al. 2022), scouring
    depth (Sharafati et al. 2020), and aeration efficiency in a Parshall flume (Sangeeta
    et al. 2021). Among the latest contributions to the field, (Sammen et al. 2020)
    compared three versions of artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms hybridized
    with Harris hawks optimization (HHO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and genetic
    algorithm (GA) to simulate the ski-jump scouring depth downstream of a spillway.
    These three hybrid algorithms were then evaluated based on several performance
    metrics, and the ANN-HHO model was ranked as the best among the models considered.
    (Sihag et al. 2021) forecasted the aeration efficiency in Parshall and Venturi
    flumes using various SC algorithms such as random forest (RF), tree-based M5P,
    group method of data handling (GMDH), and multivariate adaptive regression splines
    (MARS). Their results showed the MARS model to be the better predictor. So far,
    just a few researchers have applied SC methods for stepped cascades and have focused
    mainly on energy dissipation (Jiang et al. 2018; Salmasi et al. 2021). One of
    the most popular SC algorithms is support vector regression (SVR), which was developed
    based on the work by (Cortes and Vapnik 1995) to model and control complex engineering
    systems (Panahi et al. 2020). SVR provides a nonlinear mapping function that maps
    the training dataset in a high-dimensional feature space and identifies the connections
    between input and output (Panahi et al. 2020). This algorithm has been adopted
    as a predictive tool in various applications, such as in meteorological drought
    (Malik et al. 2021), solar energy (Lima et al. 2022), and flood susceptibility
    (Saha et al. 2021), proving to be an efficient forecasting technique. In some
    cases, the SVR model was outperformed by other SC algorithms such as ANNs, GAs,
    MARS, and RF (Al-Musaylh et al. 2018; Chen 2007; İskenderoğlu et al. 2020; Mirarabi
    et al. 2019). While the standalone SVR limitations in prediction performance are
    evident, the recent use of SVR hybridization with other optimization algorithms
    has shown promise. To the authors’ knowledge, there are very few previous studies
    that evaluated the application of hybrid SC algorithms in hydraulic engineering,
    especially in energy dissipation. The present study aims to bridge this scientific
    gap, applying for the first time several hybrid SVR models—artificial bee colony
    (ABC), grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), and firefly algorithm (FA)—to
    predict the aeration efficiency in stepped cascades. An additional element of
    novelty of this paper is the use of mutual information theory to preprocess the
    data and structure the best combination of input variables for prediction. The
    results are assessed based on several statistical and graphical evaluators, and
    the associated uncertainty is evaluated using “classic” and Bayesian types of
    entropy indicators. Overall, this study shows that SC algorithms are a valid alternative
    to empirical formulations and numerical simulations for the prediction of aeration
    efficiency in stepped cascades and possibly in other applications in hydraulic
    engineering. 2 Material and methods 2.1 Support vector regression Support vector
    regression (SVR) is one of the supervised machine learning algorithms developed
    by (Vapnik et al. 1997) for classification and regression tasks. With SVR, training
    data are used to obtain a predictive model to test against testing data. One of
    the key parameters in SVR models is the structural risk minimization (SRM), which
    determines the relationship between input and output variables (Rastogi and Sharma
    2021), and is calculated as follows: $$ y = k\\left( z \\right) = v\\emptyset
    \\left( z \\right) + c $$ (1) where k denotes the kernel function, \\(z\\) is
    the input data, v is a weight factor, \\(c\\) is a constant, and \\(\\varnothing
    \\left(z\\right)\\) represents the feature function. The following equations are
    used to define v and \\(c:\\) $$ {\\text{Minimize}}:\\left[ {\\frac{1}{2}\\left|
    {\\left| v \\right|} \\right|^{2} + P\\mathop \\sum \\limits_{b = 1}^{n} \\left(
    {\\vartheta_{b} + \\vartheta^{*}_{b} } \\right)} \\right] $$ (2) $$ \\begin{gathered}
    {\\text{Subject to}}:\\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}c} {y_{b} - \\left( {v\\emptyset
    \\left( {z_{b} } \\right) + c_{b} } \\right) \\le \\varepsilon + \\vartheta_{b}
    } \\\\ {\\left( {v\\emptyset \\left( {z_{b} } \\right) + c_{b} } \\right) - y_{b}
    \\le \\varepsilon + \\vartheta^{*}_{b} } \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right. \\hfill
    \\\\ \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad \\vartheta_{b} ,\\vartheta^{*}_{b}
    \\ge 0 \\hfill \\\\ \\end{gathered} $$ (3) where \\(P\\) is the penalty factor,
    \\({\\vartheta }_{b} \\mathrm{and} {{\\vartheta }^{*}}_{b}\\) are the loose variables,
    and \\(\\varepsilon \\) is the optimized performance of the model (Su et al. 2018;
    Wang et al. 2012). The following equation is used to solve the optimization problem:
    $$ \\begin{gathered} L\\left( {v,c,\\vartheta_{b} ,\\vartheta^{*}_{b} , B_{b}
    , B^{*}_{b} , \\delta_{b} , \\delta^{*}_{b} } \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left| v
    \\right|^{2} \\hfill \\\\ + P\\mathop \\sum \\limits_{b = 1}^{1} \\left( {\\vartheta_{b}
    + \\vartheta^{*}_{b} - \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{b = 1}^{1} B_{b} \\left( {\\vartheta_{b}
    + \\varepsilon - y_{b} + v\\emptyset \\left( {zz_{b} } \\right) + c} \\right)}
    \\right. \\hfill \\\\ - \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{b = 1}^{1} B^{*}_{b} \\left(
    {\\vartheta^{*}_{b} + \\varepsilon + y_{b} - v\\emptyset \\left( {z_{b} z} \\right)
    - c} \\right) \\hfill \\\\ \\left. { - \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{b = 1}^{1} \\left(
    {\\delta_{b} \\vartheta_{b} + \\delta^{*}_{b} \\vartheta^{*}_{b} } \\right)} \\right)
    \\hfill \\\\ \\end{gathered} $$ (4) where \\({B}_{b}, {{B}^{*}}_{b}, {\\delta
    }_{b}, \\mathrm{and} {{\\delta }^{*}}_{b}\\) are the Lagrange multipliers, and
    \\(L\\) is the Lagrangian function. So, SVR can be calculated as follows: $$ k\\left(
    z \\right) = \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{b = 1}^{1} (B_{b} - B^{*}_{b} )m\\left(
    {z.z_{b} } \\right) + c $$ (5) where the kernel function is expressed as follows:
    $$ m\\left( {z,z_{b} } \\right) = \\left\\langle {\\emptyset \\left( z \\right).\\emptyset
    \\left( {z_{b} } \\right)} \\right\\rangle $$ (6) 2.2 Firefly algorithm The firefly
    algorithm (FA) is an optimization technique inspired by the characteristics of
    fireflies in nature. This algorithm was developed by (Yang 2010a, b) and is based
    on a metaheuristic approach that uses a specific repetitive generation procedure
    to solve optimization problems (Johari et al. 2013). The FA originated from formulating
    the fireflies’ flashing demeanor and attraction based on their bioluminescence
    (Wu et al. 2020; Yang 2010a, b). The algorithm was structured based on the following
    assumptions: 1. The attraction process between the fireflies is not biased by
    sexuality and is considered unisexual. 2. The attraction level directly relates
    to the firefly brightness, so subsequently will become lesser with increasing
    distance between the two species. 3. If the level of bioluminescence is considered
    to be equal in two fireflies, their movement will be random. Each firefly has
    a light intensity \\(I\\) that is calculated as follows: $$ I = I_{0} e^{{ - \\gamma
    r_{{{\\text{ij}}}}^{2} }} $$ (7) where \\(r\\) represents the distance of the
    observer from the source, \\({I}_{0}\\) is the firefly brightness intensity at
    \\(r=0\\), \\(\\gamma \\) is the light absorption coefficient, and \\({r}_{\\mathrm{ij}}\\)
    is the Euclidean distance between the firefly individuals \\(i\\) and \\(j\\)
    that is calculated as follows: $$ r_{{ij}} = \\left\\| {x_{i} - x_{j} } \\right\\|
    = \\sqrt {\\sum\\limits_{{d = 1}}^{D} {\\left( {x_{{id}} - x_{{jd}} } \\right)^{2}
    } } $$ (8) where \\({x}_{id}\\) is the \\(d-\\mathrm{th}\\) component of the spatial
    coordinate \\({x}_{i}\\) of the \\(i-\\mathrm{th}\\) firefly and \\(D\\) is the
    total number of dimensions. The attractiveness \\(\\beta \\) is calculated as
    follows: $$ \\beta = \\beta_{0} e^{{ - \\gamma r_{{{\\text{ij}}}}^{2} }} $$ (9)
    where \\({\\beta }_{0}\\) is the attractiveness at \\(r=0\\). The position update
    of firefly \\(i\\), moving toward firefly \\(j\\), is computed as follows: $$
    x_{{{\\text{id}}}} \\left( {t + 1} \\right) = x_{{{\\text{id}}}} \\left( t \\right)
    + \\beta \\left( {x_{{{\\text{jd}}}} \\left( t \\right) - x_{{{\\text{id}}}} \\left(
    t \\right)} \\right) + \\alpha \\varepsilon $$ (10) where \\({x}_{\\mathrm{id}}\\)
    and \\({x}_{\\mathrm{jd}}\\) are the positions of firefly \\(i\\) and \\(j\\)
    in the \\(d\\) dimension, \\(\\alpha \\) is the step size factor, and \\(\\varepsilon
    \\) is a random number with uniform distribution in the range [− 0.5, 0.5]. 2.3
    Grasshopper optimization algorithm The grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA)
    was developed by (Saremi et al. 2017) and is a recently developed nature-inspired,
    population-based technique that mimics the behavior of grasshopper swarms. Grasshoppers
    are harmful pests that endanger agricultural production. Their life consists of
    two consecutive periods, known as “nymph” and “maturity,” respectively. The former
    phase is characterized by small and gradual movement, while the latter is characterized
    by long and fast motion. The movement in these two phases determines diversification
    and intensification in GOA (Ewees et al. 2020; Meraihi et al. 2021). One major
    assumption of the algorithm is that the gravity force does not affect the movement
    of grasshoppers, which leads to a faster speed of results convergence (Qin et
    al. 2021). The position of the \\(i-\\mathrm{th}\\) grasshopper \\({Y}_{\\mathrm{i}}\\)
    is expressed as follows: $$ Y_{{\\text{i}}} = {\\text{So}}_{{\\text{i}}} + {\\text{Gr}}_{{\\text{i}}}
    + {\\text{Aw}}_{{\\text{i}}} $$ (11) and the random swarm behavior is computed
    as follows: $$ Y_{{\\text{i}}} = r_{1} *{\\text{So}}_{{\\text{i}}} + r_{2} *{\\text{Gr}}_{{\\text{i}}}
    + r_{3} *{\\text{Aw}}_{{\\text{i}}} $$ (12) where \\({r}_{1}\\), \\({r}_{2}\\),
    and \\({r}_{3}\\) are random numbers between 0 and 1, \\({\\mathrm{Gr}}_{\\mathrm{i}}\\)
    is the gravitational force on the \\(i-\\mathrm{th}\\) grasshopper, \\({\\mathrm{Aw}}_{i}\\)
    is the advection of wind, and \\({\\mathrm{So}}_{\\mathrm{i}}\\) is defined as
    follows: $$ So_{i} = \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{{\\begin{array}{*{20}c} {j = 1}
    \\\\ {i \\ne j} \\\\ \\end{array} }}^{n} sf\\left( {D_{ij} } \\right)\\widehat{{D_{ij}
    }} $$ (13) where \\({D}_{ij}\\) is the distance value between the \\(i-\\mathrm{th}\\)
    and the \\(j-\\mathrm{th}\\) grasshopper, \\(sf\\) is a mathematical function
    to determine the power of social organizations, and \\(\\widehat{{D}_{ij}}\\)
    is a unity vector from the \\(i-\\mathrm{th}\\) grasshopper to the \\(j-\\mathrm{th}\\)
    grasshopper. The \\(sf\\) function is expressed as follows: $$ sf\\left( r \\right)
    = Ie^{ - r/\\ln } - e^{ - r} $$ (14) where \\(I\\) is the attraction intensity,
    \\(r\\) is a random number between 0 and 1, and \\(\\mathrm{ln}\\) is the attractive
    length scale. The \\({\\mathrm{Gr}}_{\\mathrm{i}}\\) and \\({\\mathrm{Aw}}_{\\mathrm{i}}\\)
    components are calculated as follows: $$ {\\text{Gr}}_{{\\text{i}}} = - \\widehat{{{\\text{ge}}_{{{\\text{gr}}}}
    }} $$ (15) $$ {\\text{Aw}}_{{\\text{i}}} = \\widehat{{{\\text{de}}_{{\\text{w}}}
    }} $$ (16) where \\(g\\) is the gravitational constant, \\(\\widehat{{e}_{\\mathrm{gr}}}\\)
    is the unit vector toward the center of the earth, \\(d\\) is a constant value
    and \\(\\widehat{{e}_{\\mathrm{w}}}\\) is the unit vector in the direction of
    the wind. So $$ Y_{i} = \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{{\\begin{array}{*{20}c} {j =
    1} \\\\ {i \\ne j} \\\\ \\end{array} }}^{n} sf\\left( {\\left| {Y_{j} - Y_{i}
    } \\right|} \\right)\\left( {\\left| {Y_{j} - Y_{i} } \\right|/D_{ij} } \\right)
    - gr\\widehat{{e_{gr} }} + d\\widehat{{e_{w} }} $$ (17) $$ Y_{i}^{d} = cz*\\left\\{
    {\\mathop \\sum \\limits_{{\\begin{array}{*{20}c} {j = 1} \\\\ {i \\ne j} \\\\
    \\end{array} }}^{n} cz\\left( {\\left| {ul_{d} - ll_{d} } \\right|/2} \\right)sf\\left(
    {\\left| {Y_{j}^{d} - Y_{i}^{d} } \\right|} \\right)\\left( {\\left| {Y_{j} -
    Y_{i} } \\right|/D_{ij} } \\right)} \\right\\} + \\widehat{{T_{d} }} $$ (18) where
    \\(n\\) is the number of grasshoppers, \\(u{l}_{d}\\) and \\(l{l}_{d}\\) are the
    upper and lower limits in the \\(D-th\\) dimension, \\(\\widehat{{T}_{d}}\\) is
    the value of the target (current best solution) in the \\(D-th\\) dimension, and
    the coefficient \\(cz\\) decreases the comfort zone proportional to the number
    of iterations. The calculation of \\(cz\\) is as follows: $$ {\\text{cz}} = {\\text{cz}}_{\\max
    } - \\left( {t \\times \\left( {\\left( {{\\text{cz}}_{\\max } - {\\text{cz}}_{\\min
    } } \\right)/t_{\\max } } \\right)} \\right) $$ (19) where \\({\\mathrm{cz}}_{\\mathrm{max}}\\)
    is the maximum value, \\({\\mathrm{cz}}_{\\mathrm{min}}\\) is the minimum value,
    \\(t\\) is the current iteration, and \\({t}_{\\mathrm{max}}\\) is the maximum
    number of iterations. 2.4 Artificial bee colony The artificial bee colony (ABC)
    algorithm is inspired by the honeybee swarm intelligent conduct. The ABC algorithm
    was introduced by (Teodorovic et al. 2006) to train neural networks. In the algorithm,
    the location of a food source (FS) represents a problem’s possible solution, and
    the amount of nectar in that specific source indicates the appropriateness of
    that solution. The value of employed bees (EBs) equals the number of FSs, and
    the EBs initially search for a food source. When found, they evaluate its fitness.
    FSs with a low amount of nectar are eliminated, and the FS search procedure is
    repeated until the set criteria are satisfied. In the initial phase, the population
    of food sources is generated within boundaries that are delineated by \\({x}_{j}^{\\mathrm{min}}\\)
    and \\({x}_{j}^{\\mathrm{max}}\\), where \\({x}_{j}^{\\mathrm{min}}\\) is the
    lower bound in the \\(j\\mathrm{th}\\) dimension and \\({x}_{j}^{\\mathrm{max}}\\)
    is the upper bound in the same dimension. $$ \\begin{gathered} x_{i}^{j} = x_{j}^{\\min
    } + r_{i}^{j} \\times \\left( {x_{j}^{\\max } - x_{j}^{\\min } } \\right) \\hfill
    \\\\ \\quad \\quad \\quad i = 1,2, \\ldots , N \\hfill \\\\ \\quad \\quad \\quad
    j = 1,2, \\ldots ,D \\hfill \\\\ \\end{gathered} $$ (20) where \\(x\\) is the
    food source position, \\(i\\) is the food source index, \\(N\\) is the number
    of food sources, \\(D\\) is the dimensionality of the optimization problem, and
    \\({r}_{i}^{j}\\) represents a uniform distribution of real numbers in the range
    [0,1]. In the employed phase, each employed bee is allocated to one food source
    in the entire search space $$ \\begin{gathered} cx_{s,d} = x_{s,d} + \\varphi
    \\left( {x_{s,d} - x_{t,d} } \\right) \\hfill \\\\ \\quad \\quad \\quad \\quad
    t \\ne s \\hfill \\\\ \\quad \\quad \\quad t \\in \\left\\{ {1,2, \\ldots , N}
    \\right\\} \\hfill \\\\ \\quad \\quad \\quad d \\in \\left\\{ {1,2, \\ldots ,D}
    \\right\\} \\hfill \\\\ \\end{gathered} $$ (21) where \\(cx\\) is the candidate
    position, \\(s\\) is the selected bee index, \\(t\\) is the target bee index,
    \\(N\\) is the employed bees’ number, and \\(\\varphi \\) is a uniformly distributed
    number in the range [− 1,1]. In the onlooker phase, the onlooker bees search for
    new food sources. The probability of being selected for a food source depends
    on the fitness value, which can be calculated as follows: $$ p_{{\\text{s}}} =
    {\\text{fit}}_{{\\text{s}}} /\\sum {\\text{fit}}_{{\\text{s}}} $$ (22) where \\({p}_{s}\\)
    is the selection probability for the food source and \\({fit}_{s}\\) is the corresponding
    fitness value, which is calculated as follows: $$ {\\text{fit}}_{{\\text{s}}}
    = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}c} {\\frac{1}{{fv\\left( {x_{s} } \\right) +
    1}} , fv\\left( {x_{{\\text{s}}} } \\right) \\ge 0} \\\\ {1 + \\left| {fv\\left(
    {x_{s} } \\right)} \\right|, fv\\left( {x_{{\\text{s}}} } \\right) < 0} \\\\ \\end{array}
    } \\right\\} $$ (23) where \\(fv\\) is the function value of the objective function
    and \\({\\mathrm{fit}}_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) is designed for minimization. In the scouting
    phase, the counter of food sources is checked. If the counter with the highest
    value is larger than the predefined parameter limit, the corresponding food source
    is considered exhausted, and the associated employed bee becomes a scout bee to
    make a new food source through the \\({x}_{\\mathrm{ij}}\\) equation (Zhou et
    al. 2021). 2.5 Hybrid SVR models Optimizing the SVR model parameters—regularization
    parameter C, error margin \\(\\varepsilon ,\\) and RBF kernel parameter \\(\\sigma
    \\)—is not straightforward, especially for highly nonlinearity problems. The conceptual
    flowchart for optimizing the SVR model parameters is shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Flowchart
    of the SVR model hybridization Full size image This study uses the FA, GOA, and
    ABC algorithm to optimize the SVR model parameters. The resulting models are identified
    in this paper as SVR-FA, SVR-GOA, and SVR-ABC. Table 1 reports the value of the
    relative optimization parameters. Table 1 Optimization parameters Full size table
    2.6 Laboratory data for aeration efficiency evaluation The DO is a key parameter
    in the aquatic ecosystem that has a direct impact on the life of aquatic species,
    especially when DO concertation decreases to less than 5 \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{l}}\\)
    (Asadollah et al. 2021). Turbulent conditions and bubble formation directly influence
    the DO and its spatial gradients in water (Sangeeta et al. 2021). Where the oxygen
    concentration varies between an upstream and a downstream section, a mathematical
    expression for oxygen aeration efficiency (E) can be introduced as follows (Gulliver
    et al. 1998): $$ E = \\frac{{C_{{\\text{D}}} - C_{{\\text{U}}} }}{{C_{{\\text{S}}}
    - C_{{\\text{U}}} }} $$ (24) In the above relation, \\({C}_{\\mathrm{D}}\\) denotes
    the DO concentration in the downstream section, \\({C}_{\\mathrm{U}}\\) is concentration
    section in the upstream section, and \\({C}_{\\mathrm{S}}\\) is the saturated
    concentration. The current study focuses on the aeration efficiency in stepped
    cascades. Here E depends on the flow and geometric parameters. The following general
    expression (Baylar et al. 2006) is considered: $$ E_{20} = \\, f\\left( {q, \\,
    h, \\, L, \\, N,\\alpha } \\right) $$ (25) where E20 is the aeration efficiency
    at 20 \\(^\\circ{\\rm C} \\) and q, h, L, N, and α denote unit discharge (discharge
    per unit width), step height, total length of the steps (chute length), total
    number of steps, and chute inclination angle, respectively. A dataset with 126
    laboratory tests collected in a previous study (Baylar et al. 2006) is considered
    here. Figure 2 shows a generic sketch of a laboratory setup to measure aeration
    efficiency. The laboratory experiments were carried out in a rectangular flume
    with dimensions \\(0.30 \\mathrm{m} \\mathrm{wide}\\times 0.50 \\mathrm{m} \\mathrm{depth}\\times
    5.0 \\mathrm{m} \\mathrm{length}\\). Three types of step height (0.05, 0.10, and
    0.15 m) and different values of unit discharge, varying between \\(16.67 \\frac{\\mathrm{litres}}{\\mathrm{second}}
    and 166.67 \\frac{\\mathrm{litres}}{\\mathrm{second}}\\) were considered, with
    nappe, transition, or skimming flow conditions. In this study, the dataset was
    divided into a training dataset (70% of the data) and a testing dataset (30%).
    Table 2 shows the input variable ranges for both training and testing stages,
    including maximum (Max) and minimum (Min) values as well as average (mean), standard
    deviation (STD), and skewness (SKW) values. Fig. 2 Generic sketch of a laboratory
    experimental setup to measure aeration efficiency in a stepped cascade Full size
    image Table 2 Input variable ranges for training and testing phases Full size
    table 2.7 Input variable combinations To predict the aeration efficiency, a combination
    of input variables selected among those introduced earlier (q, h, L, N, and \\(\\alpha
    \\)) must be identified. To establish proper combinations, it is essential to
    rank the input variables in terms of their relevance to the output variable (E20)
    by quantifying its degree of dependency on each input variable. This was carried
    out in this study using mutual information theory, a widely used approach for
    quantifying the flow of information among variables that originated from entropy
    theory (Singh 2016; Nourani et al. 2017; Sang et al. 2018). To quantify the flow
    of information between each parameter and the aeration efficiency, the mutual
    information between input parameter X and output Y is calculated as $$ I\\left(
    {X,Y} \\right) = H\\left( X \\right) - H(X|Y) $$ (26) where \\(I\\left( {X,Y}
    \\right) {\\text{represents the conditional entropy for }}Y{\\text{ given }}X.\\)
    H(X) denotes the Shannon entropy of the variable X, which quantifies the amount
    of inherent uncertainty in the variable X (Nourani et al. 2017) and is determined
    as follows: $$ H\\left( X \\right) = - \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{N} P\\left(
    {X_{i} } \\right)\\log P\\left( {X_{i} } \\right) $$ (27) where \\(P\\left( {X_{i}
    } \\right)\\) represents the probability values associated with the values \\({\\text{X}}_{{\\text{i}}}\\).
    The following relation gives the term H(X|Y): $$ H\\left( {X|Y} \\right) = - \\mathop
    \\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{N} \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{j = 1}^{M} P\\left( {X_{i}
    ,Y_{j} } \\right)\\log P\\left( {X_{i} |Y_{j} } \\right) $$ (28) where \\(P\\left(
    {X_{i} |Y_{j} } \\right),N, \\)\\(\\mathrm{and} M\\) are the conditional probability
    of Y fitted on X, number of input (X), and number of output (Y) parameters, respectively.
    2.8 Uncertainty analysis The aleatory uncertainty is due to the inherent randomness
    in physical phenomena. In contrast, epistemic uncertainty is the uncertainty in
    modeling the physical processes associated with the “idealization on which models
    rely.” Several types of entropy indicators, one “classic”— maximum likelihood
    (ML)—and the other four of Bayesian type—Jeffrey, Laplace, Schurmann–Grassberger
    (SG), and minimax—were used to determine which of the models include the same
    amount of information of the observed dataset. The Bayesian type indicators employ
    Dirichlet-based probabilities with prior and posterior stages (Archer et al. 2013;
    Hutter and Zaffalon 2002). The mathematical expressions of prior and posterior
    stages of the Dirichlet-based probabilities are expressed as follows: $$ \\begin{gathered}
    {\\text{Dir}}\\left( \\alpha \\right) \\triangleq {\\text{Dir}}\\left( {\\alpha_{1}
    ,\\alpha_{2} , \\ldots ,a_{K} } \\right) = \\frac{{\\Gamma \\left( {K\\alpha }
    \\right)}}{{\\Gamma (\\alpha )^{K} }}\\mathop \\prod \\limits_{i = 1}^{K} \\pi_{i}^{\\alpha
    - 1} \\hfill \\\\ {\\text{Dir}}\\left( \\alpha \\right) \\triangleq {\\text{Dir}}\\left(
    {\\alpha_{1} + n_{1} , \\ldots ,\\alpha + n_{K} } \\right) = \\Gamma \\left( {Ka
    + N} \\right) = \\mathop \\prod \\limits_{i = 1}^{K} \\frac{{\\pi_{i}^{{n_{i +
    \\alpha - 1} }} }}{{\\Gamma \\left( {a + n_{i} } \\right)}} \\hfill \\\\ \\end{gathered}
    $$ (29) where \\(\\alpha , K, \\pi_{i} , N, \\;{\\text{and}}\\;n_{{\\text{K}}}\\)
    denote the Dirichlet concentration coefficient, the number of identified bins
    in the fitted distribution over parameters, the calculated probability that one
    of the dataset input parameters X is placed in the ith bin, the number of total
    dataset input parameters, and the number of input parameters that are saved in
    the ith bin. The main difference between the aforementioned Bayesian entropy indicators
    is associated with the value of the parameter \\(\\alpha \\) in the Dirichlet
    priors. The \\(\\alpha \\) value equal 0, 0.5, and 1 for ML, Jeffrey, and Laplace
    methods, respectively. The following equations are used to compute the value of
    \\(\\alpha \\) for SG and minimax methods, respectively: $$ \\frac{1}{{{\\text{Size}}\\;{\\text{of}}\\;{\\text{vector}}\\;{\\text{of}}\\;{\\text{generated}}\\;{\\text{results}}}}
    $$ (30) $$ \\sqrt {\\frac{{{\\text{Sum}}\\;{\\text{of}}\\;{\\text{generated}}\\;{\\text{results}}}}{{{\\text{Size}}\\;{\\text{of}}\\;{\\text{vector}}\\;{\\text{of}}\\;{\\text{generated}}\\;{\\text{results}}}}}
    $$ (31) 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Input variable combinations Table 3 shows
    the mutual information between the input variables considered and the aeration
    efficiency. The parameters step height (h), and chute length (L) are the most
    relevant to the aeration efficiency, while the chute inclination angle (α) is
    the least relevant. Table 3 Mutual Information or degree of dependency between
    input variables and output Full size table Using the results in Table 3, five
    input variable combinations for aeration efficiency prediction were constructed
    (Table 4) in such a manner that moving from the C1 combination to the C5 combination;
    the least relevant parameters are progressively eliminated from the set of inputs.
    Table 4 Input variable combinations for aeration efficiency prediction Full size
    table 3.2 Model prediction performance In this study, the prediction performance
    of standalone and hybridized SVR models was evaluated using four indices: root
    mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency
    (NSE), and correlation coefficient (R). These four indices have been widely employed
    in the literature for predictions using SC algorithms (Asadollah et al. 2022;
    Ehteram et al. 2021; Mokhtari et al. 2022; Sharafati et al. 2021). The prediction
    performance based on these metrics for both training and testing phases is shown
    in Tables 5 and 6, respectively. Regarding the NSE, its value ranges from \\(-\\infty
    \\) to 1.0 (best value); values below zero indicate unacceptable accuracy, so
    they have been noted as zero in the tables (Gupta and Kling 2011). Table 5 Results
    of standalone SVR and SVR using FA, GOA, and ABC optimization algorithms for the
    training phase Full size table Table 6 Results of standalone SVR and SVR using
    FA, GOA and ABC optimization algorithms for the testing phase Full size table
    Tables 5 and 6 show the SVR-FA model and the standalone SVR model, respectively,
    show the highest and lowest prediction performance for both testing and training
    phases. Also, the C2 input variable combination for SVR-FA and SVR-GOA, and the
    C1 combination, for SVR-ABC and standalone SVR provide the most accurate aeration
    efficiency predictions. Combinations C4 and C5, characterized by the few parameters,
    produce the weakest predictions. A few graphical performance plots were produced
    to identify the model providing the most accurate predictions. Figure 3 shows
    a radar chart of the normalized performance indices R, RMSE, MAE, and NSE (the
    scale of their values was modified to between 0 and 1, with 1 corresponding to
    the best performing model). For the testing phase, the best performing model with
    the closest pattern to the square boundary is the SVR-FA-C1 model, which significantly
    outperforms the other models. In the testing phase, the SVR-GOA-C2 model performance
    significantly improves compared to its training phase performance; however, the
    SVR-FA-C2 model remains the most accurate model. The standalone SVR was a model
    with the lowest performance in both phases and achieved the normalized value of
    0 for all four indices. To make a better comparison in Fig. 3, the results of
    the SVR model were eliminated. Fig. 3 Radar plot of aeration efficiency prediction
    performance indices for a training phase and b testing phase Full size image Figures
    4 and 5 show the performance of the four models, for their best input variable
    combination, in terms of observed versus predicted aeration efficiency value for
    training and testing phases, respectively. The aeration efficiency values predicted
    by the hybrid SVR models are very close to the observed ones, while the standalone
    SVR poorly reproduces the observed data. The value of the coefficient of determination
    R2, quantifying the similarity between predicted and observed data, is the highest
    for the SVR-FA-C2 model \\(\\left({R}_{\\mathrm{Training}}^{2}=0.978. {R}_{\\mathrm{Testing}}^{2}=0.899\\right)\\).

    phases, which considers RMSE, R, and normalized standard deviation. In the diagram,
    the model that better reproduces the observed values is the closest to the point
    labeled “observed,” characterized by RMSE = 0, R = 1, and normalized standard
    deviation = 1; in this case, all three hybrid SVR models plot very close to the
    “observed” point (as opposed to the standalone SVR model), with SVR-FA-C2 again
    being the nearest. Fig. 6 Taylor diagram of aeration efficiency prediction performance

    with empirical formulations As shown above, the proposed SVR-FA-C2 model is an
    excellent predictive model. It is compared here with two empirical, experiment-derived
    formulations from the literature. These are the expression by (Baylar et al. 2007c)
    $$ E_{20} = 1 - \\exp \\left[ { - 5.730 \\times q^{ - 0.035} \\times \\left( {\\cos
    \\alpha } \\right)^{12.042} \\times \\left( {\\sin \\alpha } \\right)^{1.594}
    } \\right] $$ (32) and (Essery et al. 1978) $$ E_{20} = 1 - \\exp \\left( { -
    \\frac{H}{{\\sqrt {gh} }}\\left( {0.427 + 0.31\\left( {\\frac{{y_{{\\text{c}}}
    }}{h}} \\right)} \\right)} \\right) $$ (33) In the above equation, \\(y_{{\\text{c}}}

    the total height of the cascade (product of N and h) and \\(g\\) is the acceleration
    of gravity. The predictions by the empirical equations were compared with those
    provided by the SVR-FA-C2 model for the testing dataset, using the R, RMSE, MAE,
    and NSE indices. The results in Table 7 show that the SVR-FA-C2 model significantly
    outperforms the previously derived empirical formulations from the literature.

    model and previously developed empirical formulations Full size table 3.4 Uncertainty
    analysis The uncertainty associated with the models employed for aeration efficiency
    prediction (standalone SVR, SVR-ABC, SVR-GOA, and SVR-FA) was calculated, for
    their best input variable combination, using the R software and the Entropy Package.
    As discussed earlier, different methods—maximum likelihood, Jeffrey, Laplace,
    SG, and minimax—were used to compute entropy (Table 8 and Fig. 7). The results
    show that the entropy indicators for the predictions provided by the hybrid models
    are in line with the observed data, especially for the SVR-FA model, unlike the
    predictions by the standalone SVR model. For instance, in the training stage,
    the calculated difference between epistemic uncertainties of observed data and
    generated data from the best predictor (SVR-FA) using the aforementioned entropies
    is 0.039, 0.01, 0.004, 0.0038, and 0.029%, respectively. The calculated difference
    of epistemic uncertainties for the weakest model (standalone SVR) are 0.765, 0.213,
    0.099, 0.728, and 0.578%. For the testing stage, the percent differences are 0.0567,
    0.0192, 0.009, 0.053, and 0.0398% for the SVR-FA model and 0.868, 0.243, 0.113,
    0.793, and 0.580% for the standalone SVR model. This further confirms the generally
    better performance of the hybrid SVR models than the standalone SVR model. Table

    image 3.5 Comparison with previous studies Regarding the split of 70%/30% of the
    set of 126 laboratory tests for the training and testing phases, respectively,
    this proportion was appropriate for regression and classification purposes (Nguyen
    et al. 2021; Vrigazova 2021). Using the five selected parameters for predicting
    E20—unit discharge, the total number of steps, step height, overall length, and
    chute inclination—is consistent with previous studies (see Sects. 2.6 and 3.3).
    The application of mutual information theory to identify input variable combinations
    is also in line with other investigations showing it to be an excellent detector
    of correlation, especially for datasets characterized by a high level of nonlinearity
    (Baboukani et al. 2021; Laarne et al. 2021) and applying it for prediction of
    river sinuosity, drought, and landslides (Haghbin et al. 2021; Li et al. 2022;
    Ma et al. 2022). The finding of FA as the best optimization algorithm among those
    considered in this study is similar to that of other scholars showing it to be
    better performing than other algorithms such as particle swarm optimization (PSO)
    and real-coded genetic algorithm (RGA) (Dash et al. 2020; Su et al. 2017; Yang
    2009). The methods presented in this paper could be replicated using other datasets;
    other techniques for preprocessing and input sensitivity analysis, such as the
    Gamma test, could be compared with mutual information theory; and alternative
    machine learning approaches based on boosting and bagging algorithms or metaheuristic
    techniques such as bat algorithm, or cuckoo search could be employed to predict
    aeration efficiency. 4 Conclusion In this paper, the “classic” standalone support
    vector regression (SVR) algorithm and its hybrid versions coupled with different
    evolutionary optimization algorithms (artificial bee colony (ABC), grasshopper
    optimization algorithm (GOA), and firefly algorithm (FA)) were employed to predict
    aeration efficiency (E20) in stepped cascades. Five different parameters, namely
    unit discharge (q), step height (h), chute slope (angle α), chute length (L),
    and total number of steps (N), were obtained from laboratory experiments conducted
    by (Baylar et al. 2006), were considered as inputs of the predictive algorithms.
    To analyze the level of dependency of the predictive variable (E20) on the different
    inputs, mutual information theory was used, which showed that E20 has the highest
    degree of dependency on step height and chute length, while the lowest correlation
    is with the chute inclination angle. Five different input variable combinations
    were considered based on this “preprocessing” stage. The results revealed that
    the prediction performance of the SVR-FA-C2 model (\\({R}_{\\mathrm{training}}=0.988,
    {\\mathrm{MAE}}_{\\mathrm{training}}=0.018, {R}_{\\mathrm{testing}}=0.947, { \\mathrm{MAE}}_{\\mathrm{testing}}=0.0270)\\),
    where C2 means that the input variables used are q, h, L, and N, was significantly
    better than that of the standalone SVR model (\\({R}_{\\mathrm{training}}=0.741,
    {\\mathrm{MAE}}_{\\mathrm{trainint}}=0.129, {R}_{\\mathrm{testing}}=0.738, {\\mathrm{MAE}}_{\\mathrm{testing}}=0.126\\)).
    However, based on a single experimental dataset, the findings of this study suggest
    that hybrid SVR models, in which the SVR parameters are optimized through evolutionary
    algorithms, significantly outperform the classic SVR model, as well as previously
    developed empirical equations when predicting E20. To the authors’ knowledge,
    the current study is the first that specifically focuses on the application of
    several hybrid algorithms for E20 prediction in stepped cascades and shows them
    to be a viable, time-efficient, and cost-effective alternative for future applications.

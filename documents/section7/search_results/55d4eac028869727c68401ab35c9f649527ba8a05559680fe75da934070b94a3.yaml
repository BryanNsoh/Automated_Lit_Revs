    sensorsData-driven decision makingResource efficiency 1. Introduction Bamboo,
    a versatile and rapidly renewable resource, has played an essential role in human
    civilization for centuries (Bystriakova et al., 2004). The Food and Agriculture
    Organization (FAO) estimates that 2.5 billion people, or 40% of the world''s population,
    rely on bamboo for economic livelihood. Additionally, bamboo serves as a traditional
    housing material for at least one billion individuals. It is distributed across
    the globe in the form of grass with a remarkable range of 1707species from 128
    genera, each with unique characteristics and water requirements, which holds a
    key to sustainable development and resource conservation (Liese and Köhl, 2015,
    Sawarkar et al., 2023). In this context, water management emerges as a critical
    factor in nurturing bamboo ecosystems, ensuring their vitality, and harnessing
    their full potential. Bamboo encompasses a diverse array of species, with each
    exhibiting distinct growth patterns, sizes, and habitat preferences (Ramakrishnan
    et al., 2020). From the towering giants of the Bambusa genus to the delicate,
    clumping forms of Chusquea, bamboo thrives in diverse environments across the
    globe (M. Chen et al., 2021). These variations in species contribute to the plant''s
    adaptability and resilience, making it an invaluable natural resource for land
    restoration (Liese and Köhl, 2015, Sawarkar et al., 2023). Water, the lifeblood
    of bamboo and all living organisms, assumes different levels of significance for
    various bamboo species (Páscoa et al., 2020). Some species exhibit remarkable
    drought tolerance and can thrive with minimal water resources, while others demand
    a more abundant water supply to achieve their full potential (Liese & Köhl, 2015).
    Understanding these unique water requirements is fundamental to the sustainable
    management of bamboo forests and plantations (Yuan et al., 2017). Effective water
    management in bamboo ecosystems is not only essential for the health and vigour
    of the plants but also holds broader implications for ecosystem services, environmental
    sustainability, and human well-being (Emamverdian et al., 2020, Ramakrishnan et
    al., 2020). Water management practices that balance the needs of bamboo with those
    of the surrounding environment can help mitigate soil erosion, maintain water
    quality, and provide habitat for diverse flora and fauna (Liese & Köhl, 2015).
    Moreover, bamboo''s capacity for rapid growth and carbon sequestration positions
    it as a valuable ally in the fight against climate change (Ashour et al., 2023).
    This introduction sets the stage for a deeper exploration of bamboo, its various
    species, their specific water requirements, and the crucial role of water management
    in harnessing the potential of this remarkable resource (M. Chen et al., 2021).
    As the world grapples with the increasing challenges of water scarcity and environmental
    conservation, efficient water management becomes paramount in bamboo cultivation,
    echoing the broader principles of responsible resource utilization (D. Chen et
    al., 2014). This paper explores the transformative potential of AquaBamboo, an
    innovative precision irrigation system meticulously designed to cater to the specific
    water needs of bamboo, ultimately advancing its sustainable growth and ecological
    significance (Schöning et al., 2023). Historical records emphasize the dire consequences
    of water scarcity on agriculture, underlining the urgency of seeking innovative
    solutions (Ntaliani et al., 2008). Traditional irrigation methods, while functional,
    fall short when applied to bamboo (Erenstein, 2002). They are often marred by
    indiscriminate water application, resulting in uneven moisture distribution, wastage
    of this precious resource, and potential stress on bamboo crops, thereby affecting
    yields (Gupta, 2022). Furthermore, the reliance on fixed irrigation schedules
    and the absence of real-time data integration exacerbates these limitations (D.
    Chen et al., 2014). This lack of adaptability hinders the precise delivery of
    water tailored to varying soil conditions and the unique requirements of bamboo
    species, compounding inefficiencies and compromising the health of the bamboo
    (Cheng et al., 2022). These challenges not only undermine bamboo productivity
    but also strain water resources and contribute to environmental degradation (Surya
    & Aroquiaraj, 2018). In the pursuit of harnessing bamboo''s full potential, precise
    water management emerges as a critical factor. The AquaBamboo Precision Irrigation
    system, born out of a necessity to address the nuanced water requirements of bamboo,
    has undergone a remarkable evolutionary journey. Originating from insights gained
    through seminal studies such as (Abioye et al., 2020, França et al., 2023, Gendron
    et al., 2018, Kamienski et al., 2019, Sishodia et al., 2020, Tiwari et al., 2019).
    AquaBamboo''s technological prowess forms the backbone of its effectiveness in
    bamboo water management. The system incorporates a comprehensive hardware and
    software configuration. This integrated approach empowers AquaBamboo with the
    dynamic capability to respond to ever-changing environmental conditions. Notably,
    the incorporation of IoT sensors, weather stations, and advanced analytics positions
    AquaBamboo at the forefront of precision irrigation technology. These technological
    elements synergize to collect real-time data on crucial environmental factors
    such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation. What distinguishes
    AquaBamboo from traditional irrigation methods and existing facilities is its
    ability to transcend the complexities associated with bamboo plantations. In contrast
    to generic irrigation approaches, AquaBamboo is tailored to the specific needs
    of bamboo, acknowledging the variability in environmental factors within mountainous
    bamboo plantations. In response to these challenges, AquaBamboo emerges as a groundbreaking
    innovation in the realm of precision bamboo agriculture (Khorraminia et al., 2019,
    Sawarkar et al., 2021). With a primary mission to optimize bamboo water utilization,
    AquaBamboo integrates cutting-edge technologies, including Internet of Things
    (IoT) sensors and advanced analytics, to provide a holistic solution rooted in
    the principles of sustainable bamboo cultivation (D. Chen et al., 2014). Its dynamic
    adaptation to changing environmental factors, data-driven decision-making, and
    precise water delivery underscore its potential to revolutionize bamboo agriculture''s
    relationship with water resources (do Amaral et al., 2023, Jæger and Mishra, 2020).
    This research sets out to elucidate the distinctive features and advantages of
    AquaBamboo, comparing it with existing precision irrigation solutions (Pelé et
    al., 2022). By drawing insights from a comprehensive analysis of relevant literature,
    including studies by (Camargo Garcia, J.C., Trinh, 2020; Parthiban & Seenivasan,
    2017), this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of AquaBamboo''s
    significance in reshaping the landscape of precision bamboo agriculture, as highlighted
    in the works of (Khorraminia et al., 2019). In examining AquaBamboo''s integration
    of real-time data, adaptive irrigation strategies, and resource efficiency, this
    review paper aims to underscore the transformative potential of precision irrigation
    specifically tailored for bamboo cultivation (Chatterjee & Bhowmik, 2023). The
    subsequent sections will delve deeper into AquaBamboo''s architecture, its numerous
    advantages, and the profound implications it holds for the sustainable management
    of water resources in the context of bamboo agriculture (Jæger & Mishra, 2020).
    Through this exploration, we endeavor to shed light on how AquaBamboo can contribute
    to both increased bamboo productivity and the preservation of ecological balance,
    advancing the principles of responsible bamboo water management in the modern
    era (Isukuru et al., 2023, Khorraminia et al., 2019). 2. Literature review Precision

    farmers (Yen et al., 2021). Through web or mobile applications, farmers gain access
    to real-time data visualizations, enabling them to monitor the system''s performance.
    Additionally, they can make necessary adjustments to the irrigation schedule based
    on real-time observations. This user-friendly interface puts the power of precision
    irrigation into the hands of bamboo cultivators, promoting active management and
    control. The system architecture diagram visually represents the flow of data
    and interactions among AquaBamboo''s components. It illustrates how the bamboo-specific
    IoT sensors feed crucial data into the control system, where advanced analytics
    and algorithms make informed decisions. These decisions then translate into precise
    water delivery through the specialized irrigation infrastructure, ultimately optimizing
    water management tailored explicitly for bamboo cultivation. AquaBamboo system
    architecture embodies a holistic and bamboo-specific approach to precision irrigation.
    It seamlessly combines real-time data collection, advanced analytics, and precise
    water delivery, revolutionizing water management practices for sustainable bamboo
    growth in alignment with the principles of responsible resource utilization. 3.5.
    Performance Evaluation 3.5.1. Precision water management principles for sustainable
    bamboo growth The incorporation of a comprehensive hardware and software configuration
    empowers AquaBamboo with the dynamic capability to respond to ever-changing environmental
    conditions and optimize water usage for the sustainable growth of bamboo (Sawarkar
    et al., 2023, Sawarkar et al., 2023, Yadav and Mathur, 2021) This integrated approach
    addresses the shortcomings of traditional irrigation methods, positioning AquaBamboo
    as a promising solution for advancing sustainable precision agriculture. Penman-monteith
    equation for bamboo evapotranspiration (ET): The Penman-Monteith equation, a foundational
    tool in precision irrigation (Fao et al., 2015), is adept at estimating evapotranspiration,
    which encompasses the collective water loss due to bamboo transpiration and soil
    evaporation. This equation accounts for crucial environmental factors, including

    the area of the bamboo cultivation field (m²). These fundamental equations are
    at the core of precision irrigation systems like AquaBamboo, enabling the determination
    of the optimal amount of water needed for bamboo based on a comprehensive understanding
    of various environmental factors (Rao et al., 2022). Parameters such as and A
    are fine-tuned to match the bamboo species and local conditions. Advanced bamboo-specific
    crop water requirement calculation: AquaBamboo takes precision to the next level
    by employing a sophisticated model for calculating bamboo-specific evapotranspiration
    ( . This model considers a range of influencing parameters: Where: represents
    bamboo-specific evapotranspiration (mm/day), accounting for water transpiration
    by bamboo and evaporation from soil and crop surfaces. is the bamboo-specific
    crop coefficient, indicating bamboo''s water usage concerning reference evapotranspiration
    ). is the reference evapotranspiration, representing water loss from a well-watered
    grass reference crop under standard conditions. are reduction factors due to mulching
    or ground cover, soil water stress, and salinity stress, respectively (Fao et
    al., 2015). AquaBamboo''s data-driven irrigation approach aligns seamlessly with
    this intricate model. By collecting real-time data from IoT sensors, which encompass
    critical parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, AquaBamboo
    determines to reflect the specific state of the bamboo and its immediate environment
    (Nkeuwa et al., 2022). Additionally, acts as a benchmark for gauging bamboo water
    requirements. AquaBamboo continuously calculates through the integration of weather
    data and sophisticated analytics, allowing it to adapt to dynamic weather patterns
    and ensure precise irrigation. Moreover, the reduction factors ( ) are influenced
    by various variables, all of which AquaBamboo incorporates into its decision-making
    process (Tiwari et al., 2019). Real-time soil moisture data helps assess soil
    water stress ( ), guiding precise irrigation interventions. The system''s adaptability
    to changing weather conditions and its ability to tailor irrigation schedules
    to bamboo needs contribute to mitigating salinity stress ( ). 3.5.2. Equation:
    Precision Irrigation in Action The equation I = k * D represents the core principle
    behind precision irrigation, where \"I\" denotes the irrigation amount required,
    \"D\" signifies the soil moisture deficit, and \"k\" represents the irrigation
    efficiency factor (Nkeuwa et al., 2022). Precision irrigation is a critical practice
    in modern agriculture, aimed at optimizing water usage for healthy crop growth.
    • I (Irrigation amount): This variable quantifies the amount of water needed for
    irrigation, calculated by multiplying the soil moisture deficit (D) by the irrigation
    efficiency factor (k). • D (Soil moisture deficit): Soil moisture deficit signifies
    the shortfall in soil water content compared to the ideal level required for healthy
    plant growth. It considers factors such as evaporation, plant water uptake, and
    precipitation. • k (Irrigation efficiency factor): The irrigation efficiency factor
    reflects the system''s effectiveness in delivering water to the root zone. It
    takes into account various factors like system losses and distribution efficiency.
    In the context of AquaBamboo and precision bamboo agriculture (Nkeuwa et al.,
    2022), this equation plays a pivotal role. By continuously monitoring soil moisture
    levels through IoT sensors (Cabarcas et al., 2019), AquaBamboo accurately calculates
    the soil moisture deficit and determines the precise amount of water needed to
    optimize soil moisture levels for bamboo growth. The efficiency constant (k) embodies
    AquaBamboo''s capacity to maximize water usage efficiency, ensuring that each
    unit of water applied contributes effectively to bamboo hydration and growth while
    minimizing wastage In essence, AquaBamboo''s data-driven approach seamlessly harmonizes
    with the complexity of the advanced bamboo-specific crop water requirement model.
    This alignment empowers AquaBamboo to optimize water delivery with unparalleled
    precision, thereby enhancing bamboo health and yield while contributing significantly
    to sustainable water management practices (Rao et al., 2022). The Fig. 3 illustrates
    the AquaBamboo data-driven precision irrigation system. It commences with IoT
    sensors collecting real-time bamboo-specific data, including soil moisture, temperature,
    and other critical parameters (A) (Camargo Garcia, J.C., Trinh, 2020). This data
    is then transmitted to the Control System (B), where it is integrated and amalgamated
    for analysis (C) (Yousaf et al., 2023). The Control System performs data analysis
    (D), utilizing advanced algorithms to derive actionable insights from the collected
    data. Download : Download high-res image (75KB) Download : Download full-size

    analyzed insights, informed irrigation decisions are made (E) (Nkeuwa et al.,
    2022). These decisions thoughtfully factor in bamboo water requirements, dynamically
    evolving weather conditions, and other relevant variables. Subsequently, the Control
    System translates these decisions into specific instructions to regulate the Irrigation
    Infrastructure (F) (Yen et al., 2021). This infrastructure meticulously manages
    the delivery of water (G) (Yen et al., 2021), ensuring that each bamboo plant
    receives the precise amount of water tailored to its unique needs. This intricate
    and interconnected system, from data collection to precise water delivery, embodies
    the core principles of AquaBamboo''s data-driven precision irrigation, facilitating
    not only efficient but also adaptive bamboo water management (Tiwari et al., 2019).

    Precision Irrigation The empirical implementation of AquaBamboo across diverse
    scenarios has unveiled its remarkable potential to revolutionize bamboo agriculture.
    By harnessing real-time data and intelligent decision-making, AquaBamboo consistently
    demonstrates its capacity to optimize water usage, elevate crop health, and significantly
    increase yields. AquaBamboo unequivocally demonstrated its ability to minimize
    water wastage while ensuring optimal bamboo hydration (Camargo Garcia, J.C., Trinh,
    2020). Through the continuous monitoring of soil moisture levels facilitated by
    its network of IoT sensors (Cabarcas et al., 2019), AquaBamboo dynamically adjusted
    irrigation schedules and water distribution. The results were striking: a substantial
    reduction in water consumption without any compromise in bamboo crop health (Xu
    et al., 2022). AquaBamboo''s precision in tailoring irrigation interventions to
    the actual needs of bamboo plants emerged as a game-changing solution, particularly
    in regions facing water scarcity challenges (Abioye et al., 2020). Furthermore,
    AquaBamboo''s data-driven approach translated into remarkable improvements in
    bamboo crop health and yield (Sawarkar, Shrimankar, Kumar, et al., 2023). The
    system''s analytics provided critical insights into bamboo plant responses to
    varying water levels, empowering farmers to fine-tune irrigation strategies (Kleinhenz
    & Midmore, 2001). This precision resulted in healthier bamboo plants with well-established
    root systems, leading to a significant overall increase in bamboo yield (Tiwari
    et al., 2019). Additionally, AquaBamboo''s adaptability allowed for swift responses
    to sudden weather shifts, shielding bamboo crops from water stress during unexpected
    dry spells (Prasad Nirala et al., 1996). The success of AquaBamboo can be attributed
    to the harmonious synergy of data integration, advanced analytics, and responsive
    irrigation (Boursianis et al., 2021). Through continuous data collection and analysis
    (Lin et al., 2019), the system adeptly identified patterns and trends, enabling
    it to predict optimal irrigation schedules. This predictive capability ensured
    that bamboo crops received water precisely when needed, fostering accelerated
    growth rates and higher overall yields (Ranieri et al., 2020). In Fig. 4 (insights
    based on (Camargo Garcia, J.C., Trinh, 2020)), we visually depict the fundamental
    contrast between two distinct bamboo irrigation approaches: Traditional Irrigation
    and AquaBamboo''s Data-Driven Approach. This graphical representation employs
    two columns to illustrate the flow of water distribution for each method. • Traditional
    Irrigation (Left Column): This conventional approach relies on a uniform irrigation
    schedule, often leading to inefficient water distribution (Field, 2021). Uneven
    moisture levels across the bamboo field result in over-watering in some areas
    and under-watering in others, failing to address specific water requirements of
    different bamboo types and soil conditions. • AquaBamboo''s Data-Driven Approach
    (Right Column): AquaBamboo''s innovative methodology leverages real-time data
    collection to guide precise water delivery (Field, 2021). It considers factors
    such as soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and the unique needs of different
    bamboo varieties. By integrating IoT sensors and advanced analytics (Field, 2021),
    AquaBamboo ensures water is delivered precisely where and when it is needed the
    most. This targeted approach optimizes water usage, prevents over-watering or
    under-watering, and significantly enhances bamboo health and growth. Download

    vs. Tradition: Transforming Bamboo agriculture. In summary, this diagram effectively
    highlights the fundamental distinctions between traditional and data-driven bamboo
    irrigation methods (Xu et al., 2022). It visually portrays how AquaBamboo''s approach
    overcomes the limitations of uniform irrigation by utilizing real-time data for
    tailored water distribution, resulting in more efficient water utilization and
    improved bamboo outcomes (Tiwari et al., 2019). Fig. 5 (insights based on (Kleinhenz
    & Midmore, 2001)) visually portrays the correlation between soil moisture levels
    and both crop health scores (measured on a scale of 0–100) and crop yield (measured
    in kilograms). The x-axis represents soil moisture levels as a percentage, while
    the left y-axis quantifies crop health scores, and the right y-axis represents
    crop yield. As soil moisture levels increase, both crop health scores and crop
    yield exhibit a positive trend (Abioye et al., 2020). This correlation underscores
    the significance of maintaining optimal soil moisture levels for optimal bamboo
    crop performance. AquaBamboo''s precise water management, driven by real-time
    data, contributes to this positive correlation by ensuring that bamboo plants
    receive the right amount of water at the right time, leading to improved health
    and higher yields (Boursianis et al., 2021). Download : Download high-res image

    Versions Notes Abstract Addressing the critical challenges of resource inefficiency
    and environmental impact in the agrifood sector, this study explores the integration
    of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies with IOTA’s Tangle, a Distributed Ledger
    Technology (DLT). This integration aims to enhance sustainable agricultural practices,
    using rice cultivation as a case study of high relevance and reapplicability given

    agricultural practices. Keywords: agrifood sector; internet of things (IoT); distributed
    ledger technologies (DLT); IOTA tangle; rice cultivation; sustainability; real-time
    data recording; environmental footprint 1. Introduction The agrifood sector, a
    cornerstone of the global economy, sustains billions by providing food and livelihoods.
    Yet, it grapples with multifaceted challenges, from climate change and environmental
    degradation to population growth, food security, and consumer trust. Addressing
    these requires sustainable, efficient agricultural practices that optimize resource
    use, curtail waste, and elevate productivity and quality. The Internet of Things
    (IoT) is emerging at the forefront of solutions. This network of interconnected
    devices, equipped with sensors, actuators, and communication protocols, offers
    real-time monitoring and control over parameters like crop growth, soil health,
    water consumption, pest management, and greenhouse gas emissions. Beyond monitoring,
    IoT enhances traceability and transparency throughout the food supply chain, bolstering
    food safety and consumer trust. However, the integration of IoT in agriculture
    is not without challenges, especially concerning data management: Data Security:
    Ensuring data integrity and safeguarding against malicious tampering is paramount.
    Data Privacy: Stakeholders’ rights and preferences necessitate stringent measures
    against unauthorized data access or disclosure. Data Scalability: As farms grow
    and technology adoption surges, systems must accommodate an increasing influx
    of data from sensors and devices. Data Interoperability: Seamless data exchange
    is crucial, especially when devices and systems employ diverse formats and standards.
    Data Cost: Efficient data transmission and storage are vital, particularly for
    frequent or low-value transactions. Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) and
    the IoT can address these challenges by offering a decentralized, immutable, and
    transparent platform for data management. However, while the blockchain, i.e.,
    the most widely used form of DLT, has revolutionized data storage through cryptographically
    linked blocks, it is necessary to address scalability, transaction fees, energy
    consumption, and more limitations in the data-intensive IoT universe. IOTA offers
    a fresh perspective on DLT with its Tangle, a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure.
    Unlike blockchains, the Tangle permits feeless transactions, validated by nodes
    as they initiate new transactions [1,2]. This structure provides enhanced scalability,
    reduced energy consumption, quantum resistance, and the capability for offline
    transactions and microtransactions. Rather than replacing traditional blockchain
    systems, IOTA complements them, especially for the high-frequency data transactions
    inherent to the IoT. With projections indicating that, by 2030, approximately
    125 billion IoT devices will be interconnected [3], the sheer volume of data generated
    necessitates robust management, distribution, and storage solutions. While DLT
    offers a promising avenue, our study narrows its focus on IOTA’s Tangle, a DLT
    uniquely equipped to handle the vast data streams from IoT devices, given its
    scalable, fast, and feeless micro-data transaction capabilities. With this backdrop,
    our central research inquiry is both theoretical and pragmatic: Is it possible
    to devise a web application that seamlessly integrates Tangle IOTA with IoT-enabled
    sensors? These sensors, designed for monitoring sustainability metrics in agriculture,
    would empower operators in the agrifood sector with real-time insights, enabling
    timely interventions. To explore this, we have embarked on a Proof-of-Concept
    test focusing on data from rice cultivation. Our Proof-of-Concept focuses on rice
    cultivation, chosen due to its significant freshwater usage, which is the highest
    among all crops. Additionally, rice’s global prevalence and status as the world’s
    primary food crop make it a pertinent subject for our study [4]. We developed
    an analytical dashboard to demonstrate that using technologies such as IoT and
    IOTA optimizes product quality, product processing efficiency, cost, and production
    time. In summary, when we fully control production with devices and sensors (IoT),
    receiving data even from remote locations with the support of IOTA, it is possible
    to reduce the release of CO 2 by having control over irrigation and the right
    portion of water (more water equals more CO 2 and more waste). In addition, it
    is possible to track the product 24 h a day, receiving recorded data on IOTA almost
    through streaming. Finally, the process is very green, reducing electricity consumption.
    2. Background and Related Works In this section, we first provide a general background
    on distributed ledger technology (DLT), including both blockchains and tangles
    like IOTA. Then, we discuss related work on (i) traditional monitoring systems
    in agriculture, (ii) the use of the blockchain applied to agriculture, and (iii)
    the use of IOTA Tangle technology applied to agriculture. 2.1. Background DLT
    has become a transformative force in information technology, reshaping organizational
    collaboration and operation [5,6]. It employs a ledger system where multiple nodes
    can read and write data, maintaining a state based on consensus, which varies
    with the network’s decentralization level. DLTs are characterized mainly by their
    ledger structure: chain-based systems like blockchain and DAG-based systems like
    IOTA’s Tangle. Chain-based DLTs utilize a linear series of blocks, securing records
    through cryptographic hashing and consensus mechanisms like proof of work or stake.
    These blockchains differ in their access protocols and validator addition methods,
    affecting interaction levels with network components. In contrast, DAG-based DLTs
    allow parallel transaction processing, offering potentially higher scalability
    than chain-based systems. With independent transaction confirmation and no need
    for a single global consensus, DAG structures provide a more dynamic and scalable
    consensus approach. This contrasts with chain-based systems, where all transactions
    require network-wide confirmation, leading to potential bottlenecks in transaction
    processing and scalability. 2.2. Related Work 2.2.1. Traditional Monitoring Systems
    in Agriculture Historically, agricultural monitoring has evolved through various
    traditional systems. Key studies in this field have explored different approaches:
    Wang et al. developed a low-cost, real-time remote environmental monitoring system
    combining wireless equipment and mobile phones that was powered by solar energy.
    This system was effective in collecting real-time information and fulfilling online
    acquisition needs [7]. Dan et al. implemented a Greenhouse Environment Monitoring
    System using ZigBee technology, wireless sensors, and control nodes. This system
    focused on controlling environmental data for enhanced greenhouse management [8].
    Hashim et al. reviewed using an Arduino device for temperature and soil moisture
    control, managed via an Android smartphone. This study contributed to designing
    smart monitoring systems using an embedded micro-web server and IP connectivity,
    aiming to aid the agriculture sector in achieving quality production [9]. Karim
    et al. developed an application for precision farming based on a wireless sensor
    network and IoT cloud. This application focused on optimizing irrigation and monitoring
    microclimatic conditions to improve water usage efficiency in farming [10]. 2.2.2.
    Blockchain Technology and Sustainable Agriculture Blockchain technology has significantly
    impacted the concepts of trust and efficiency in sustainable agricultural development.
    This change became prominent as agrifood companies accessed knowledge banks and
    digital resources [11]. Blockchain, alongside the Internet of Things (IoT), is
    pivotal in advancing sustainable and precision agriculture, which leverages technology
    to enhance agricultural efficiency [12]. Lin et al. proposed an ICT e-agriculture
    system model based on the blockchain for local and regional use. They also developed
    a validation tool for the technical and social requirements of these systems [11].
    Patil et al. focused on using IoT for remote monitoring and automation in agriculture.
    They provided an architecture integrating blockchain technology for smart greenhouse
    farms, offering a security framework that combines blockchain with IoT devices
    for enhanced security and communication in smart farming [13]. Munir et al. implemented
    an intelligent Smart Watering System (SWS) based on an Android application for
    smart water consumption in crops. The system, equipped with affordable sensors,
    uses blockchain and Fuzzy Logic approaches for data security and intelligent decision-making,
    enabling real-time monitoring and periodic irrigation [14]. Baralla et al. developed
    a blockchain-oriented platform to authenticate food origin data. This platform
    aims to enhance supply chain transparency, promote local smart food tourism, and
    boost local economies, emphasizing the importance of food as a “business card”
    for tourist sites [15]. Iqbal and Butt proposed an IoT-based system for crop protection
    at all stages, focusing on deterring animal attacks using sensors and a Repelling
    and Notifying System (RNS). The system records incidents in a centralized Farm
    Management System (FMS), integrated with an agricultural blockchain for shared
    ledger functionalities, enhancing meta-information sharing [12]. Cocco et al.
    implemented a system offering visibility to food processes and certifications,
    using Self Sovereign Identity, blockchain, and the InterPlanetary File System.
    This system aims to safeguard data storage and access, ensuring the eligibility,
    transparency, and traceability of certifications [16]. 2.2.3. IOTA Applied in
    Agriculture IOTA’s integration into agriculture showcases innovative projects
    combining IoT, AI, and DLT: Flores et al. developed the Interplanetary Precision
    Agriculture (IPA) project, which harnesses IoT, AI, and DLT. The project utilizes
    various technologies, including an autonomous rover (Magrito) for crop performance
    data, Precision Habitat PRO for environmental control, a bluetooth scale for weight
    data, and a farm management system for data aggregation. The collected data are
    sent to the IOTA Tangle network to ensure immutability and interoperability. This
    aims to enhance cultivation processes both on Earth and in extraterrestrial environments,
    addressing issues of centralization and data silos in supply chains. The overarching
    goal is to establish a sustainable food supply and minimize the environmental
    footprint of agricultural practices [17]. Lamtzidis et al. introduced a distributed
    ledger-based system focused on securing IoT data integrity. They utilized IOTA’s
    Tangle ledger for the secure processing and storage of aggregated field data,
    transitioning from a cloud-centric to a node-centric architecture. In this setup,
    each Super node maintains its data in a distributed and decentralized database,
    with the backend functioning as both a data consumer and resource provider. This
    modular approach has made significant contributions to open-source communities
    in blockchain and IoT, presenting a more secure and decentralized method for managing
    IoT data [18]. 3. Design of the Study The primary objective of this paper is to
    demonstrate how integrating IoT and IOTA technologies can optimize product quality,
    processing efficiency, cost, and production time in agriculture. By utilizing
    IoT devices and sensors, and leveraging IOTA for data management, we aim to achieve
    significant reductions in CO 2 emissions through precise irrigation control and
    water management. This approach also allows for continuous product tracking and
    reduces electricity consumption, contributing to a more sustainable agricultural
    process. Our methodology involves creating a prototype that simulates a rice production
    process. This setup includes seedlings equipped with sensors to monitor and regulate
    water levels within a specified range. This prototype demonstrates efficient data
    transmission, production control, and system functionality. The study heavily
    focuses on the impact of IoT in agriculture. IoT technology, encompassing remote
    sensors, cloud and edge computing, unmanned vehicles, and data analytics [19],
    is revolutionizing agricultural practices. It allows for effective monitoring
    of crucial factors like humidity, air temperature, and soil quality, thus enhancing
    crop yields, irrigation efficiency, and accurate harvest forecasting (https://www.appsforagri.com/en/news/impact-of-iot-in-the-agriculture/,
    accessed on 7 October 2023). Moreover, the IoT’s integration into agriculture
    significantly reduces environmental impacts by lowering water and energy usage,
    greenhouse gas emissions, and fertilizer runoff. Financially, it increases farmers’
    profitability and competitiveness by opening up new markets and services [20].
    This study extends the IoT’s capabilities in agriculture by incorporating IOTA’s
    DLT, which is particularly suited for high-frequency IoT scenarios. IOTA offers
    benefits such as feeless transactions, data integrity, scalability, and interoperability,
    making it ideal for a secure and transparent network of IoT devices in the agricultural
    sector. Our methodology places a strong emphasis on optimizing resource utilization,
    with a particular focus on water efficiency. By integrating IOTA’s advanced DLT
    capabilities with intelligent irrigation systems, we aim to significantly enhance
    the precision and effectiveness of water usage in agriculture. Drawing insights
    from Mboyerwa et al.’s [21] research, this integration is expected to drastically
    reduce resource consumption. Notably, it can lead to halving water usage, decreasing
    nitrogen consumption by 25%, and reducing methane emissions by 50% to 70%. These
    substantial reductions are primarily achieved through the optimized control of
    field flooding durations, which effectively slows down the activity of methane-producing
    microorganisms. The integration of IOTA plays a critical role in this process.
    Its technology enables a secure, transparent, and highly efficient network of
    IoT devices. This network facilitates the real-time collection, processing, and
    analysis of vast amounts of agricultural data. Consequently, it allows for more
    precise irrigation decisions, ensuring water is used more effectively and sustainably.
    The real-time data processing and feeless transactions offered by IOTA enhance
    the system’s responsiveness and accuracy, leading to a more intelligent and environmentally
    friendly approach to irrigation. This not only optimizes resource usage but also
    contributes to the broader goals of sustainable and precision agriculture. The
    study employs a multi-faceted technological approach, simulating a data-intensive
    paddy farm environment. By integrating IOTA, we enhance data management, introduce
    robust authorization systems, and streamline data transmission. The design covers
    three domains: Local: Involves structuring, programming, and assembling a Raspberry
    Pi and its sensors. Remote: Facilitates internet connectivity and links to an
    online platform. Cloud-based server: Serves as the primary project hub. Technologically,
    the study utilizes Raspberry Pi devices and sensors, EMQX (MQTT), VPN and Ubuntu,
    Docker, IOTA, and MongoDB (ATLAS). The programming spans across Python, NodeJs,
    Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 3.1. IOTA IOTA stands out as a pioneering DLT tailored
    for the IoT landscape. Distinct from conventional blockchain systems, IOTA employs
    the Tangle, a unique architecture that addresses the scalability and transaction
    cost challenges inherent to blockchains. It positions IOTA as an optimal choice
    for the real-time processing of vast data streams from IoT sensors in sustainable
    agriculture. The IOTA network is underpinned by nodes’ individual instances of
    the IOTA software. These nodes validate and record transactions, and in the context
    of sustainable agriculture, they could process data received from IoT sensors,
    monitoring parameters like soil moisture, temperature, and pH levels. To ensure
    efficient operation, nodes had to use a robust but affordable environment with
    at least a 4-core processor, 8GB RAM, SSD storage, and a public IP address. Each
    node offers different features across multiple ports, facilitating peer-to-peer
    communication with HTTP and MQTT protocol, allowing for resilient data communication
    in every agricultural scenario. IOTA nodes can manifest as Mainnet, Testnet, or
    Devnet nodes. While Mainnet nodes handle real-world IOTA transactions, including
    actual sensor data, Testnet and Devnet nodes serve developmental and testing purposes,
    enabling developers to refine applications before Mainnet deployment. There are
    two primary IOTA node software options: Hornet and Bee. Hornet, crafted in Go,
    is resource-efficient, aligning with IoT applications where resources might be
    limited. Conversely, Bee, developed in Rust, emphasizes modularity and performance.
    Given its resource efficiency, Hornet is preferred for most agricultural IoT scenarios.
    Hornet’s implementation can leverage various avenues, including APT Repository,
    Docker image, binary files, or source construction. The Docker image, renowned
    for its portability, is particularly favored. The ability of Docker to effortlessly
    deploy and scale applications aligns with agricultural contexts, where the number
    of IoT sensors can fluctuate based on farm dimensions and requirements. Node security
    is paramount, necessitating measures like safeguarding login accounts, sealing
    unused ports, disabling remote consensus algorithm execution, and deploying a
    reverse proxy for augmented security. The Docker image gohornet/hornet (https://hub.docker.com/r/iotaledger/hornet,
    accessed on 7 October 2023) is utilized for Hornet implementation, with the repository
    cloned locally. Configuration files (i.e., config.json and peering.json) facilitate
    settings customization and node synchronization storage. The database of IOTA
    mandates a mainnetdb folder creation, with the use of authentication hashes ensuring
    data access exclusivity. The Docker image also initiates a server, loading a dashboard
    for node and data monitoring essential for overseeing and troubleshooting the
    IoT sensor network in agriculture. 3.2. Raspberry Pi 4 In this rice production
    study, we use the Raspberry Pi 4, a capable computer equipped with an ARMv8 quad-core
    1.5 GHz 64-bit CPU, dual-band wireless LAN, Bluetooth 5.0, and 1-2-4 GB RAM. It
    offers a GPIO port with 40 pins, 26 being GPIO pins, and various ports like USB,
    micro-HDMI, Ethernet, and more, including support for 4K video. The GPIO socket
    includes 40 pins, bridging the Raspberry Pi and external devices, where 26 of
    these are GPIO pins; the rest are power or ground pins. They are labeled in both
    physical and BCM numbering for convenience. Raspbian, a version of Linux designed
    for Raspberry Pi, serves as the operating system. It is installed via NOOBS, with
    a browser, email program, LibreOffice, Minecraft, and a command-line tool (raspi-config)
    for configuration management. Sensors Various sensors monitor and control environmental
    conditions, including humidity, temperature, flame detection, rain, pressure,
    and soil moisture: The DHT11 is a temperature and humidity sensor with a digital
    output, allowing communication with a Raspberry Pi up to 20 m away. It provides
    stable measurements with a maximum temperature accuracy variation of 2 °C and
    humidity accuracy variation of 1 percent. The flame detection sensor can detect
    infrared emissions from a flame and convert them into an electrical signal readable
    by any microcontroller. It has a reading angle 60° and features both an analog
    and a digital output. The rain sensor detects the presence and concentration of
    water. An LED indicates its operation and features with an analog output to calculate
    the amount of water present. The pressure sensor measures atmospheric pressure,
    temperature, and altitude. It can measure an atmospheric pressure level ranging
    from 300 to 1100 hPa and a temperature range from −40 °C to +85 °C. The soil moisture
    sensor detects soil moisture and the presence or absence of water. It has a digital
    output that indicates the level of humidity. This study uses two such sensors
    to monitor the optimal water levels for rice field irrigation. The first sensor
    measures the minimum water level needed for healthy rice growth, while the second
    sensor identifies the maximum water level to prevent wastage and crop damage.
    3.3. Sensor–Raspberry Pi communication The communication between sensors and computers
    is ensured by a Python script, which sets the sensors with the correct configuration
    for reading. It cyclically checks each sensor, recalling its state or value and
    storing the results in temporary variables. These variables are part of a JSON-like
    object that requires further conversion to become a standard JSON object. The
    script establishes a remote connection on the EMQX API, an MQTT web tool, and
    proceeds with publishing through the publish function. Since Python lacks the
    module allowing Raspberry Pi to communicate with the web tool, it must be installed
    and imported. To avoid saturating the Raspberry Pi’s resources, time intervals
    are established between the data acquisition of one sensor and the next. A pause
    of 2 s has been set before another sensor is analyzed to minimize data and information
    loss. The dialogue between the two technologies is summarized in Figure 1. Figure
    1. Sensor–Raspberry Pi communication. 3.4. MQTT and EMQX This project uses EMQX,
    a web socket implementation of MQTT, to facilitate remote IoT data collection.
    EMQX is an open-source MQTT IoT message broker built on the Erlang/OTP platform,
    renowned for its soft real-time capabilities, low latency, and distributed development
    features. MQTT is a lightweight message exchange protocol centered around a publication–subscription
    model. EMQX is accessible via browser and is designed for mass client access,
    providing fast and low-latency message routing between large physical network
    devices. It can host large-scale MQTT client connections, with a single server
    node supporting 2 million connections. It is also extensible, supporting custom
    plug-ins for authentication and other features. It fully supports IoT protocols,
    including MQTT, MQTT-SN, soap, LwM2M, and other proprietary TCP/UDP-based protocols.
    The connection configuration is used to set up links through any API that will
    serve as a bridge to dialogue your code with the MQTT platform. Required fields
    for EMQX connection configuration encompass “Name”, “Client ID”, “Host”, and the
    listening port. EMQX Broker provides many configuration elements and supports
    global and local configurations, allowing multi-protocol and port utilization.
    Auto Reconnect and Clean session functions are used to perform automatic reconnection
    when the broker goes offline and to start a session after a disconnection. The
    project creates various “topics” or subjects by creating a new subscription. The
    Topic must have a title and a subtitle, which are necessary if there is a need
    to filter the data. They are used to categorize the topic according to the path
    to which it belongs. This logic is useful when you want to retrieve information
    to access it; you need to know and refer to the precise path, otherwise, you cannot
    link to the topic. Data simulation within the project is accomplished with data
    input in JSON or TXT format allowing for textual data and key-value schema object
    notation. JSON data were sent via the Raspberry device at 2-s intervals, and it
    is possible to say that no visible latency or message loss was encountered. Figure
    2 displays the most important functionalities of this tool. Through the functionality
    called “New Connection”, it is possible to create a new mandatory initial connection
    or it can be used to create additional parallel connections, leading to Step 2,
    i.e., the connection configuration. This part will also serve as a setting for
    the links through any API that will serve as a bridge to dialogue your code with
    the MQTT platform. Figure 2. EMQX: MQTT Websocket Toolkit. In detail, Table 1
    shows the port numbers devoted to exposing services, dealing with sockets, the
    default WS (web socket) or WSS (web socket secured with SSL). The latter is a
    security protocol based on modern public key cryptographic algorithms, i.e., TLS/SSL.
    It can ensure transmission security in the computer communication network, providing
    the benefits of strong certification, thus ensuring confidentiality and completeness.
    Table 1. Protocol port. 3.5. IOTA Dashboard The IOTA environment provides a dashboard
    designed as a user interface that supplies real-time insights and control over
    the IOTA Tangle. In sustainable rice cultivation, IoT devices can be deployed
    across rice fields to monitor various parameters such as soil moisture, temperature,
    pH level, and more. These devices can transmit data to the IOTA Tangle, which
    can be accessed and analyzed in real-time through the IOTA dashboard. The IOTA
    dashboard enables one to view the IOTA DLT state. In detail, it provides an Analytics
    tab, which makes available parameters about the node, network, and resources,
    including information about the Tangle network, node details, memory usage, and
    cache data. Moreover, users can search for messages sent to the node, for instance,
    measurement from the IoT devices deployed in the rice fields monitoring by using
    the Explorer tab. In addition, the IOTA dashboard comes with a Visualizer tab
    responsible for providing a visual representation of the live evolution of the
    Tangle network, offering a real-time view of data transmission. Network management
    is eased by noting the information displayed in the Peers tab, and finally, plugin
    add-ons are allowed in the Plugins tab. Through the IOTA dashboard, farmers, researchers,
    and decision-makers can gain valuable insights into the conditions of the rice
    fields, enabling them to make informed decisions that promote sustainable cultivation
    practices. This case study will explore how the IOTA dashboard can be used in
    promoting sustainability in rice cultivation. The analytics tab is composed of
    four sub-tabs, namely Tangle, Node, Memory, and Caches. As depicted in Figure
    3, the Tangle subsection supplies several valuable metrics, such as known messages,
    new messages, received messages, messages sent, message requests received, sent
    message requests, heartbeats received, heartbeats sent, milestone request received,
    sent milestone request, and deleted packets. Figure 3. IOTA dashboard: analytics.
    Between these analytics, it is possible to note a heartbeat signal. Heartbeat
    is a periodic signal that hardware or software produces, and it is used both to
    show proper operation and synchronize nodes. It is one of the mission-critical
    systems’ most widely used techniques to provide high availability and fault tolerance
    of network services by detecting network or node system failures. Other sections
    provide information regarding memory usage and cache state. The Node section is
    in charge of providing insights on messages sent per milestone, which define a
    temporal interval defining the time needed to pass until the network coordinator
    executes the message validation. The state and the throughput of the network are
    viewable in the network graph, as depicted in Figure 4, which represents the construction
    of a Tangle or a DAG graph, i.e., the distributed registry in which are stored
    all transitions. In the sidebar of Figure 4, there are the following Tangle properties:
    (i) messages that indicates the number of messages sent; (ii) MPS, i.e., the number
    of messages sent to the network per second; (iii) TIPS, i.e., the number of unapproved
    transactions; (iv) referenced, i.e., the percentage of transactions referenced
    by other transactions; (v) conflicting, i.e., the percentage of transactions with
    conflicts; and (vi) solid, i.e., transactions with their history. Figure 4. Tangle
    graph. In Figure 5, it is possible to see one of the requirements for interacting
    with the IOTA network. The choices depend on the technologies one chooses to use,
    but also on whether one wants to use one’s own node (direct access) or rely on
    third-party nodes. Figure 5. Dependencies and requirements of IOTA. Constructing
    a personal node for network access is the optimal choice. The entire infrastructure
    can be raised using an editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) or any other editor or
    IDE. Once Docker is configured and operational, the installation of either Hornet
    or Bee is enabled allowing for crafting nodes. Upon completion, the node may be
    launched via Docker. After configuring the network settings, the dashboard is
    accessible, enabling the owned node viewing as well as interaction with other
    nodes and also providing insights regarding the IOTA network. MongoDB Atlas Atlas
    uses MongoDB as a database, taking advantage of its scalability and flexibility
    and of its useful indexes and queries for data processing. Data originating from
    the Raspberry Pi are sent through EMQX and are written into the Atlas database.
    To establish a database on MongoDB Atlas for agricultural monitoring, follow these
    steps: register on the Atlas website, choose a cluster, create the database, and
    configure the connection string. MongoDB stores data records as BSON documents
    in collections, similar to tables in relational databases. The document model
    based on MongoDB is clear, easy to use, and supports various languages through
    its included drivers. The Atlas interface provides an overview of the data flow
    and allows the transformation of agricultural data into charts, as shown in Figure
    6, which displays two charts, one tracking the temperature and humidity data over
    time based on the hour, the other counting the amount of data each sensor has
    sent compared to the other sensors. Figure 6. Atlas data charts. By selecting
    the desired database, it is possible to choose the chart and then select the data
    of interest to be represented in the graph, setting a title and some properties.
    This chart is saved in the dashboard, and every time new data are received, they
    are written into the database, automatically updating the various charts based
    on the corresponding fields. There are approximately nine chart options, with
    an average of two subcategories for each. In Figure 7, it is possible to see the
    number of times a certain temperature is detected. For example, 23 degrees has
    been detected 25 times, while 24 degrees has been detected only 5 times. The chart
    on the right displays the total count of temperature data. In this case, both
    the humidity and barometer sensors detect the temperature. By adding the two values
    shown in the second chart in Figure 3, which are 26 and 27, a percentage of 53%
    is obtained. Figure 7. Temperature. These visualizations can be made visible to
    specific users, such as farmers or sustainability experts, or even made public
    through an off-site link. This feature enhances the accessibility of critical
    sustainability information, even outside of Atlas, promoting transparency and
    informed decision-making in agricultural practice. Hence, integrating MongoDB
    and Atlas in an IOTA-based deployment offers a robust solution for monitoring
    and analyzing sustainability parameters in agriculture. The flexibility in storage
    options, ease of setup, and data visualization capabilities make it a valuable
    tool in modern agricultural practices. Figure 8 depicts the architecture of the
    proposed model and the logical flows running through the system components. Briefly,
    data gathered by the IoT Sensors flow through EMQX to the Raspberry Pi, which
    acts as a gateway to send data to the HTTP Application Server. The node Application
    Server manages such data communicating with the IOTA network passing through the
    deployed node, as well as with the Atlas interfaces, thus enabling data monitoring
    via the analytical dashboard. Figure 8. Architecture of the system. 4. Results
    To monitor sustainability parameters in agriculture, MongoDB Atlas has been integrated
    into the IOTA-based deployment. The setup process has involved registering on
    the Atlas website, selecting a cluster, creating the database, and configuring
    the connection string. The Atlas interface allows the transformation of data into
    charts, which are automatically updated with new data. To this aim, data from
    devices like Raspberry Pis are sent through EMQX to a Node.Js script by leveraging
    APIs, and received data are stored in the MongoDB Cloud of Atlas. Moreover, we
    implemented a connection established with the local IOTA node (Hornet Mainnet)
    to propagate the data in the IOTA Tangle. The created Node.js server takes care
    of receiving, processing, and translating the data into services for the graphical
    interface. A lightweight Node.js server is created to receive, process, and translate
    the data into services for the graphical interface. The server listens on a customizable
    port, providing services to those who connect to that port. Aiming to achieve
    real-time insights, we developed an analytical dashboard, which is responsible
    for making viewable the received data. These are divided into several sections,
    each describing a different analysis aspect, as depicted in Figure 9. The sections
    include notifications, derived data, graphs, a table, alerts, and a map. The data
    in the table include count, id, date, time, message, temperature, humidity, pressure,
    altitude, latitude, longitude, status, and sensor name. Two soil sensors have
    been installed, one for notifying when the soil’s water level is insufficient
    and the other for alerting when there is excess water. Figure 9. Analytical dashboard.
    Hereafter, we illustrate the various sections of the analytical dashboard displayed
    in Figure 9. Section 1 showcases a menu that remains visible while scrolling the
    page. It counts both incoming data and highlights any data that requires attention.
    These particular data points are also tallied in the alerts. Section 2 illustrates
    data derived from analytical operations performed on raw sensor data. Starting
    from the left, we have the average humidity, obtained by summing up the humidity
    data points and dividing them by the number of humidity data points. Next, the
    minimum and maximum humidity values are reported by comparing the previously stored
    data with the subsequent data. Depending on the result, the old data may be overwritten.
    As in the case of humidity, it is possible that there are no fluctuations in either
    an upward or downward trend, resulting in the “Min” and “Max” values being equal.
    “Average Temperature”, “Min”, and “Max” values are calculated in the same manner.
    In Section 3, the “HUMIDITY” box displays the humidity data received from the
    temperature sensor. Specifically, the x-axis represents the time the data are
    received, and the y-axis represents the temperature data, which remain constant
    at 65% in this case. Regarding the “TEMPERATURE” box, the same procedure described
    in the previous case is followed, with the difference being that the temperature
    data are considered. As observed, the temperature data vary between 22 and 21
    degrees within the selected time interval. The “traces” are the lines used to
    construct the graph; in the “TEMPERATURE” box, there are eight traces. Both boxes
    feature a scroll bar that appears when the graph requires more space to display
    the newly received data while allowing the visualization of previous data by scrolling
    through the bar. Section 4 shows a dynamically populated table with JSON data
    sent by Raspberry sensors. There is a data model for the data types that each
    sensor sends, and the table can be fully viewed by scrolling horizontally. The
    same applies to the quantity of data, which requires scrolling vertically to view
    it. In detail, the data in the table include: Count indicates the number of times
    a specific sensor sends data; Id uniquely identifies each sensor; Date indicates
    the date the data was sent by Raspberry; Time indicates the time corresponding
    to the data sent by Raspberry; Message indicates additional information regarding
    the data; Temperature indicates the detected temperature; Humidity indicates the
    recorded humidity; Pressure indicates the identified pressure; Altitude indicates
    the measured altitude; Latitude and Longitude indicate the geographic coordinates
    of the sensor’s location; Status takes a value of 0 or 1 depending on the sensor;
    Sensor Name indicates the sensor’s name, which is useful for identifying the specific
    sensor being considered. The value “undefined” indicates that the specific sensor
    being considered does not produce that type of data detected by another specific
    sensor for that purpose. In Section 5 of Figure 9, the sensors with values requiring
    greater attention are displayed on the left, as seen in the table. Each alert
    notification is accompanied by the date, time, critical message, and an icon indicating
    its significance. At the top, the total number of alert messages received is shown.
    On the right, a real map is displayed, showing simulated geo-localization coordinates
    of the sensors. These data can either be pre-set or dynamically passed and plotted.
    Similarly, Figure 10 demonstrates the functioning of the two soil sensors, one
    alerting when the soil’s water level is insufficient, the other signaling when
    there is excess water. Figure 10. Functioning of the soil sensors. According to
    the works of Mboyerwa et al. [21] and Prem Kumar et al. [19], IoT and IOTA have
    emerged as disrupting technologies in the agrifood supply chain and sustainability
    optimization; we deem that our Proof-of-Concept will be a further advancement
    in monitoring and improving the sustainability of agrifood production processes.
    Moreover, IoT devices relying on centralized communications present a number of
    security threats related to privacy and security. IOTA addresses these flaws,
    also removing the blockchains’s limitations; indeed, IoT devices lack the computational
    power and storage needed to run consensus algorithms to be an involved part of
    the blockchain [22]. Taken together, our results answered the question that guided
    our research by creating a web application capable of integrating IOTA with IoT
    sensors devoted to real-time monitoring of agrifood supply chains. 5. Discussion
    In this section, we discuss the obtained results. 5.1. DLTs in Agriculture—IOTA
    and Traditional Blockchains We summarize here the main results of the Proof-of-Concept
    illustrated in the previous section to then put them into perspective in the trend
    of adoption of DLT and blockchain technologies in the agricultural sector and
    the role that IOTA can specifically play in this context: Efficiency in Resource
    Utilization: This study shows that integrating IoT and IOTA can significantly
    reduce resource consumption. Thus, this integration effectively implements the
    sustainable agricultural practices illustrated in [21]. Technological Infrastructure:
    This study employs various technologies, including Raspberry Pi 4, various sensors,
    and IOTA, a distributed ledger technology tailored for IoT. These technologies
    monitor various environmental conditions like soil moisture, temperature, and
    pH. Data Management and Security: This study uses IOTA to bolster data management
    and introduce a robust authorization system. It also employs MQTT and EMQX for
    remote IoT data collection, supporting up to 2 million connections on a single
    server node. Environmental Impact: IoT has the potential to mitigate the environmental
    footprint of agriculture by reducing water and energy consumption, greenhouse
    gas emissions, and fertilizer runoff. Financial Benefits: IoT can elevate the
    profitability and competitiveness of farmers by granting access to new markets,
    services, and performance-based incentives. Real-Time Monitoring: The IOTA dashboard
    provides real-time insights into various parameters like soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH levels, enabling informed decision-making for sustainable agriculture.
    Technological Toolkit: This study uses a diverse set of technologies, including
    Raspberry and its sensors, EMQX (MQTT), VPN and Ubuntu, Docker, IOTA, and MongoDB,
    and is programmed in Python, NodeJs, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Sustainability:
    This study concludes that the IoT stands as a pivotal force in enhancing agricultural
    productivity and sustainability, especially as the demand for food rises amidst
    limited resources. Transitioning from these findings, we delve into the broader
    implications and applications of DLTs in agriculture. Agriculture is a critical
    sector facing numerous challenges, including climate change, environmental degradation,
    and the need for sustainable practices. These challenges necessitate innovative
    solutions, and one such promising technology is the IoT. However, the vast amounts
    of data generated by IoT devices must be managed securely and efficiently. Moreover,
    agrifood businesses are increasingly pressured by governmental and consumer organizations
    to validate the safety and quality of their production processes. To meet these
    demands, DLTs offer a robust solution. They provide a decentralized system for
    storing and updating data across a network of nodes, eliminating the need for
    a central authority. DLTs employ cryptography and consensus mechanisms to ensure
    data integrity and validity. While DLTs offer numerous benefits like traceability,
    transparency, and operational efficiency, it is important to note that they are
    not a one-size-fits-all solution. Different DLTs have their own strengths and
    weaknesses, which we will explore by comparing three prominent DLTs in agriculture:
    Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and IOTA. Of course, this is not a random choice;
    all three platforms stand out for their agricultural achievements and potential
    compared to other DLTs and blockchains. We will focus on two main use cases: traceability
    in the agrifood supply chain and real-time monitoring of cultivation practices.
    The latter case became more recently of interest and focus, and this article contributes
    to its strengthening and development. At the same time, the former has an older
    record, being one of the first use cases of non-financial blockchain/DLT applications.
    To compare these three DLTs strictly from a technological standpoint, see the
    study of Garriga et al. [6] instead, and the study of Dalla Palma et al. [23].
    5.1.1. Traceability in the Agrifood Supply Chain The agrifood supply chain is
    a complex network of multiple stakeholders: farmers, processors, distributors,
    retailers, and consumers. Each stakeholder has its record-keeping system, which
    may not be compatible or transparent to others. This creates challenges in ensuring
    food products’ origin, quality, and safety and meeting local and international
    regulations. DLTs can help overcome these challenges by providing a shared and
    immutable ledger of transactions and data throughout the production process. Ethereum
    and Hyperledger Fabric, the most popular blockchain platform from the Hyperledger
    software ecosystem, are traditional blockchains supporting traceability in the
    agrifood supply chain. Ethereum is a public blockchain that allows anyone to join
    and participate in the network. It supports smart contracts, i.e., self-executing
    agreements written in code that can automate supply chain processes and ensure
    traceability. Fabric is a private blockchain that allows only authorized participants
    to join and transact on the network. It supports private transactions and complex
    supply chain permissions that can handle sensitive data and comply with regulations.
    Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric have been used for various traceability projects
    in the agrifood sector. For instance, IBM Food Trust (https://www.ibm.com/blockchain/solutions/food-trust,
    accessed on 7 October 2023) is a platform built on Fabric that connects farmers,
    processors, distributors, and retailers to share data and track food products
    from farm to fork. Similarly, OriginTrail (https://origintrail.io/, accessed on
    7 October 2023) is a protocol built on Ethereum that enables interoperable data
    exchange and verification across different supply chain actors. The articles by
    Cocco et al. [24] and Marchesi et al. [25] discuss case studies and software development
    methodologies specifically in the context of blockchain-based food traceability
    systems. 5.1.2. Blockchains vs. IOTA DLT in the Agrifood Supply Chain Among DLTs,
    the blockchain is a technology that can enhance the privacy and security of IoT-interconnected
    smart devices, as several papers have demonstrated [26,27]. The blockchain offers
    features such as transparency, immutability, resilience, and cryptography that
    can address some of the challenges of IoT network architecture. However, the blockchain
    also has a cost in terms of transaction fees and architectural complexity, requiring
    expertise from various disciplines. Therefore, the blockchain should manage valuable
    assets, such as business data and financial assets [28]. On the other hand, the
    IOTA Tangle is a DLT that can improve sustainability and agrifood monitoring without
    such costs, allowing agrifood supply chains to adopt it without affecting their
    business [29]. 5.1.3. Real-Time Monitoring of Cultivation Practices The other
    use case for DLTs in agriculture, treated explicitly in the previous section of
    this article, is real-time monitoring of cultivation practices. This involves
    using IoT sensors to collect various data from the field, such as soil moisture,
    temperature, humidity, pest infestation, and so on. These data can help farmers
    optimize their inputs, reduce their environmental impact, and improve their yields.
    However, IoT sensors generate huge amounts of data that must be transmitted and
    stored securely and efficiently. As we have seen, IOTA is a DLT that is designed
    for high-frequency IoT scenarios. Unlike traditional blockchains that use a linear
    chain of blocks to store data, IOTA uses a DAG called Tangle. The Tangle is composed
    of individual transactions that are interlinked to each other and stored across
    a network of nodes. To issue a transaction on the Tangle, a node has to validate
    two previous transactions. This allows IOTA to overcome the cost and scalability
    limitations of blockchains. As highlighted in the description of our study, IOTA
    has several advantages for real-time monitoring of cultivation practices. First,
    it enables zero-fee transactions, meaning nodes can send and receive data without
    paying fees. This is ideal for frequent, low-value data transmissions from IoT
    sensors. Second, it enables high scalability, meaning the network can handle many
    transactions per second without compromising performance or security. This is
    ideal for accommodating varying numbers of sensors and devices on the network.
    Third, it enables data integrity, which means that the data stored on the Tangle
    are tamper-proof and verifiable by anyone on the network. This is ideal for accurate
    decision-making based on real-time data. Our study offers a comprehensive guide
    for building an IOTA-based real-time monitoring system tailored for sustainable
    agriculture. In this context, it complements Future Farm (https://future-farm.iota.org/#/,
    accessed on 7 October 2023), an initiative by the IOTA Foundation that also leverages
    IOTA for data collection and analysis through IoT sensors in greenhouses. While
    Future Farm focuses on process optimization—emphasizing the sharing of IoT data
    among various stakeholders in agriculture—our approach is more user-centric. Specifically,
    we demonstrate how a farm operator can effectively utilize the IOTA Tangle for
    real-time monitoring. 5.1.4. Complementarity: Technology and Business Perspective
    Technology: The strengths and weaknesses of Ethereum, Fabric, and IOTA are summarized
    in Table 2 from a sustainable agriculture perspective standpoint. While Ethereum
    and Fabric cater to supply chain transparency and notarization of product origin
    and quality, IOTA is tailored for high-frequency IoT data transactions. However,
    these DLTs are not mutually exclusive. They can be integrated and interoperable,
    offering a comprehensive view of the agrifood sector. For example, IOTA’s real-time
    data can be linked to Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric’s smart contracts, triggering
    actions or payments based on predefined conditions. Alternatively, IOTA’s data
    streams can be hashed and anchored to Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric’s blockchains,
    creating a secure and verifiable record of the data history. These integrations
    can leverage the best features of each DLT, creating a synergistic effect. Table
    2. Comparison of DLTs in agriculture: Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and IOTA.
    Business: DLTs offer different value propositions for the agrifood sector depending
    on their use cases and applications. While traceability emphasizes transparency,
    notarization, and compliance, real-time monitoring targets operational efficiency
    and sustainability. These value propositions can have various implications for
    market differentiation and consumer engagement. For instance, traceability can
    bolster branding and product authenticity, creating a competitive edge in the
    market. Traceability can also assure consumers about product origin and quality,
    increasing their trust and loyalty. On the other hand, real-time monitoring can
    lead to sustainable practices and cost savings, improving the business’s bottom
    line. Real-time monitoring can also offer insights into sustainable cultivation
    practices, educating consumers and raising awareness. Enriched Business Value:
    Integrating DLTs in the agrifood sector can also create new opportunities for
    funding acquisition and carbon credit trading. These opportunities can provide
    financial incentives for adopting DLTs and promoting sustainable agriculture.
    For example, traceability and real-time monitoring can serve as evidence for quality
    manufacturing and sustainable cultivation practices. This can be pivotal for acquiring
    funding from government agencies or private investors that incentivize such practices.
    Moreover, integrating DLTs can facilitate the generation of carbon credits by
    validating sustainable practices. These credits can be traded as securities on
    DLT-based platforms, offering a new revenue stream for farmers and businesses.
    On the other hand, Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric can leverage the capability
    of inter-enterprise transactions of their smart contracts to go beyond traceability
    to boost supply chain efficiency and profitability, as shown in [30,31]. Summing
    up, Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and IOTA are three prominent DLTs that can revolutionize
    the agrifood sector. While they cater to different agrifood needs, their combined
    strengths can create a holistic solution that addresses the challenges and opportunities
    of the sector. By integrating them into suitable ecosystems as characterized in
    Salzano et al. [32], innovators can ignite a global business transformation that
    benefits farmers, businesses, consumers, and the environment. 5.2. Reapplicability
    of Our Model Our research demonstrates a flexible and adaptable model, where the
    specific components we used can be substituted with equivalent alternatives to
    suit different requirements. Database Management System Flexibility: While our
    study leverages the capabilities of MongoDB, the architecture of our model is
    not limited to this particular DBMS. The design is compatible with various other
    database management systems, enhancing the model’s applicability across diverse
    data management scenarios. Hardware Versatility: In terms of hardware, our choice
    of the Raspberry Pi 4 is illustrative rather than prescriptive. The model can
    be adapted to work with a range of single board computers or similar devices,
    provided they possess comparable technical capabilities. This flexibility ensures
    that our model can be deployed in a variety of hardware environments. Sensor Selection
    and Adaptability: We chose specific sensors for monitoring key parameters in the
    rice supply chain. However, this selection is not rigid. Different sensors can
    be employed based on the requirements of other agrifood products or supply chains.
    The adaptability of our model to various sensor types and data inputs underscores
    its potential for broader application in agriculture. Cross-Product and Supply
    Chain Applicability: While our Proof-of-Concept is centered on rice cultivation,
    the underlying model is designed to be transferable to other agrifood supply chains.
    This transferability is facilitated by the selection of appropriate sensors and
    the integration of various communication protocols. System and OS Compatibility
    through Containerization: Our model’s use of containerization technology ensures
    its portability and compatibility across different systems and operating systems.
    This aspect of the design significantly enhances the model’s utility and ease
    of deployment in diverse IT environments. In summary, the design of our study
    reflects a commitment to versatility and adaptability, allowing for the application
    of our model in a variety of agricultural contexts beyond its initial implementation.
    6. Conclusions This research project has been centered around exploring the transformative
    impact of IOTA, in synergy with IoT technologies, on enhancing sustainable agricultural
    practices. Our study specifically targeted the optimization of water-resource
    consumption in rice field irrigation, which is a critical aspect of sustainable
    agriculture. The core objective of our study was to meticulously monitor and improve
    resource utilization, with a particular emphasis on water efficiency. The results
    demonstrate that an intelligent irrigation system, powered by advanced sensor
    technology, can be instrumental in achieving sustainable cultivation practices.
    This system enables real-time data acquisition and analysis, which are pivotal
    in guiding empirical practices for resource optimization. Specifically, we observed
    the potential of this system to significantly reduce water usage by up to 50%,
    lower nitrogen consumption by 25%, and decrease methane emissions by 50% to 70%.
    A key aspect of our system is its ability to compile historical data on water
    usage, providing a rich dataset for strategizing future resource management approaches.
    The integration of IoT devices, particularly those managed through IOTA’s technology,
    has proven exceptionally effective in handling and analyzing large volumes of
    data, thereby boosting the overall efficiency and precision of agricultural processes.
    A notable accomplishment of this project was the seamless and rapid data transmission
    from the field (via Raspberry Pi) to the cloud. This was achieved with minimal
    latency, demonstrating the effectiveness of MQTT in data routing and the capacity
    of IOTA to provide near-real-time recording and optimal storage for extensive
    datasets. Despite some latency challenges encountered with MongoDB, it played
    a crucial role as an intermediary, facilitating effective communication and data
    management between IOTA and other integrated technologies. This integration was
    pivotal in enhancing data organization and processing speed. Looking ahead, future
    research could explore optimizing sensor sampling rates to make them more dynamic
    and responsive to environmental and inventory conditions. Additionally, adjusting
    the number of active sensors based on these parameters could enhance efficiency,
    allowing some IoT devices to enter a sleep mode when not needed, thus conserving
    energy. In conclusion, this research highlights the integral role of IOTA, particularly
    in tandem with the IoT, in the future of sustainable agriculture. IOTA emerges
    not just as one of many options, but as a particularly compelling choice for real-time
    monitoring and implementation of sustainable agricultural practices. Its application
    extends beyond mere data tracking to actively influencing and optimizing on-ground
    practices, aligning closely with the global goals of environmental conservation
    and food security. This study affirms that the synergy of IOTA and IoT is not
    just a computational marvel but a practical tool for empirical advancements in
    agriculture. Author Contributions Conceptualization, R.P. and R.C.; methodology,

    Timely and comprehensive data on HABs are essential for their scientific management,
    a need unmet by traditional methods. This study constructed a novel digital twin
    lake framework (DTLF) aiming to integrate, represent and analyze multi-source

    and climate change have become one of the most serious problems for the global
    water environment. Timely and comprehensive data on HABs are essential for their
    scientific management, a need unmet by traditional methods. This study constructed
    a novel digital twin lake framework (DTLF) aiming to integrate, represent and

    multi-source monitored results of HABs and water quality were integrated and displayed

    comprehensively, visualized realistically and analyzed precisely. Experimental
    results demonstrate the satisfying frequency of video-based HAB monitoring (once

    satellite remote sensing Key Contribution: Harmful algal blooms (HABs) in nearshore
    areas of lakes can be monitored in a real-time manner. And multi-source monitoring
    data from satellite remote sensing, video monitoring and in situ monitoring can
    be integrated, visualized and analyzed in a 3D manner in the constructed digital
    twin lake framework. 1. Introduction Harmful algal blooms (HABs) caused by lake
    eutrophication and climate change have become one of the outstanding water environment
    problems in the world [1,2]. HABs can alter the bacterial community structure
    and disrupt recreation and human health [3]. Unique microbial communities are
    assembled during a cyanobacterial bloom via stochastic and potentially deterministic
    processes, including competition, mutualism and trade-offs [4,5]. In recent years,
    HABs have occurred in over 40% of the lakes with areas over 500 km2 in the world,
    causing serious eco-environmental harms [6]. From May to June in 2007, a large-scale
    HAB broke out in Lake Taihu and led to a water crisis in Wuxi City [7]. In September
    2013, a serious HAB event occurred in the west of Lake Erie, which resulted in
    nearly 2000 people in Carroll Town, Ohio being unable to access clean drinking
    water [8,9,10]. Moreover, a multi-day recommendation of “do not drink” was issued
    in Toledo City for over 500,000 people [11,12]. Considering this background, timely
    and comprehensive data on HABs in lakes are of great significance for their scientific
    prevention and control, because emergency response measures can be initiated timely
    and the harm caused by HABs can be minimized to the greatest extent. Monitoring
    methods for HABs in lakes have been widely researched in the past two decades,
    aiming to obtain both the area and intensity of HABs [13]. Field monitoring is
    a traditional means for monitoring HABs in lakes. In this kind of method, water
    samples were collected in the field and then analyzed in laboratory to obtain
    detailed characterization factors of HABs, e.g., Chl-a concentration and algal
    density. The present conditions of HABs in the whole lake can be finally assessed
    with spatial interpolation methods [14,15]. Although these methods have many advantages
    such as detailed monitoring parameters, high monitoring accuracy, etc., they consume
    a large amount of manpower, material and financial resources [16]. In addition,
    the monitoring efficiencies of these methods are quite low and thus they are suitable
    only for small lakes and reservoirs [17]. To realize efficient monitoring of HABs,
    many in situ monitoring systems were constructed in lakes [18,19]. With these
    systems, HAB information and main water quality parameters in core positions were
    collected continuously and the working costs were reduced. These methods, however,
    cannot accurately reflect present conditions of HABs in the whole lake with a
    limited number of monitoring stations [20,21]. More importantly, the 3D spatial
    distribution of HABs and water quality in the lake body was hard to assess due
    to the lack of an effective framework for data integration and representation.
    In recent years, satellite remote sensing has been considered as a new and efficient
    means for HAB monitoring due to its strong ability to enable large-scale and long-term
    observations of surface elements [22,23]. In this type of method, both area and
    spatial distribution of HABs in lakes can be obtained rapidly and periodically
    via processing methods for satellite imageries such as visual interpretation [24],
    watercolor inversion [25,26], color space analysis and supervised classification
    [27,28], spectral index analysis [29,30], etc. The generated HAB products greatly
    improved the efficiency of HAB monitoring in lakes, but there were still several
    significant limitations. Firstly, the method was limited by the revisit cycles
    of the satellites and the uncontrollable meteorological conditions, and high-frequency
    HAB monitoring was hard to realize during emergency prevention and control periods
    of HABs [31]. Moreover, the method is limited by the spatial resolution of the
    satellite imageries, and HAB information regarding the local, sensitive water
    areas in lakes, such as water sources, cannot be obtained effectively [17]. In
    order to make up for the deficiencies of the field monitoring methods, in situ
    monitoring and satellite remote sensing, video monitoring has been gradually applied
    in HAB monitoring in lakes because it can work continuously without artificial
    participation. With this kind of means, coverage ratios of HABs in key nearshore
    areas can be obtained using methods for digital image processing and machine learning
    [32,33]. However, there were still shortcomings in terms of efficiency. Although
    the monitoring frequency can be improved to a certain extent with multi-threading
    technology [17], real-time monitoring was still difficult to realize due to complex
    network environments in field. More importantly, this kind of means can only monitor
    HABs in nearshore areas of lakes, while the intensity and spatial distribution
    of HABs in the whole lake cannot be understood. For HABs monitoring and management,
    the integration, visualization and analysis of multi-source monitoring data are
    quite valuable for present condition assessment and abnormity recognition. Traditional
    research, nevertheless, generally cannot meet this need. Digital twin, a new leading-edge
    technology which can accurately reflect physical objects in the digital world
    by integrating various types of 3D model data such as 3D terrains, 3D real-scenes
    and 3D entities [34,35], has developed rapidly in recent years, providing new
    thoughts for the integration, representation and analysis of multi-source HAB
    data in lakes. In theory, real information of HABs in lakes can be represented
    with digital twin technology. The existing research about digital twin has focused
    mainly on medical analysis [36], industrial design [37], urban management [38],
    etc., and digital twin scenes have been constructed by integrating multi-source
    3D model data, multi-sensor monitoring data and multi-variate mechanism models.
    The objectives of realistic expression and intelligent manageability have been
    achieved preliminary. However, few works about digital twin technology have been
    completed at present that focus on lake water eco-environment management. Accordingly,
    the intelligent level of HAB prevention and control in lakes is still very low.
    In summary, the main shortcomings of traditional methods of HAB monitoring, prevention
    and control contain three main aspects. Firstly, real-time monitoring of HABs
    in nearshore areas of lakes was difficult to realize and there was still much
    room for efficiency improvement. Moreover, the water environment of lakes was
    hard to be realistically represented and precisely analyzed with a limited number
    of monitoring equipment. Additionally, it was quite difficult to comprehensively
    grasp the information on the HABs and key water quality parameters in lakes due
    to the lack of effective methods for integrating multi-source monitoring data.
    To make a breakthrough in this field, we constructed a digital twin lake framework
    (DTLF) in this paper for the prevention and control of HABs. The novelty of this
    work can be summarized as follows: (1) Browser-based front ends, instead of programs
    deployed on network servers as usual, are used to execute the video-based process
    of HAB monitoring. As a result, the problem of low efficiency in the traditional
    methods is completely solved; (2) DTLF is constructed by modelling a precise 3D
    model of the lake body, and the water environment of the lake can be realistically
    represented using monitoring data on the water quality, as well as precisely analyzed
    in a 3D manner; (3) Based on the constructed DTLF, present conditions of HABs
    and water quality in lakes can be grasped comprehensively by integrating monitoring
    data from satellite remote sensing, video devices and in situ stations. 2. Results
    2.1. Research Area and Data Source The constructed DTLF has been applied in the
    fifth largest freshwater lake in China, i.e., Lake Chaohu. Lake Chaohu (31°25′28″~31°43′28″
    N, 117°16′54″~117°51′46″ E), one of the three key lakes for eutrophication control
    in China, is located in the center part of Anhui Province. In the past two decades,
    HABs have occurred frequently in Lake Chaohu [17,31,33], which has become a major
    issue restricting the sustainable development of the regional society and economy.
    To prevent and control HABs, many monitoring devices, e.g., automatic monitoring
    stations of water quality, land-based video devices, etc., have been deployed
    in and around Lake Chaohu in recent years. Data sources for DTLF construction
    and HAB monitoring and management are descripted as follows: (1) Digital elevation
    model (DEM) of Lake Chaohu Watershed with a spatial resolution of 5 m (Figure
    1) was used to dynamically determine the boundary and surface of Lake Chaohu,
    as introduced in step (1) in Section 5.1; Figure 1. The general situation of the
    research area (i.e., Lake Chaohu). (2) Forty-two land-based video devices around
    Lake Chaohu (Figure 1) were used for real-time monitoring of HABs in nearshore
    areas. From 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day, coverage ratios of HABs in key nearshore
    areas were calculated automatically and periodically (once per second), as introduced
    in Section 5.3; (3) Eight automatic monitoring stations for water quality in Lake
    Chaohu (Figure 1) were used to obtain key water quality parameters for different
    water depth such as total phosphorus (TP), NH3-N, chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), etc.,
    in core positions. The time interval for this monitoring is four hours. Based
    on these dynamical and layered monitoring data, spatial distribution and multi-dimensional
    analysis of water quality were realized in the whole lake body, as explained in
    Section 5.4; (4) Three automatic monitoring stations for water level (Figure 1)
    were used to obtain the hourly dynamic water levels of Lake Chaohu. By averaging
    the monitoring data from the three stations, the final water level was obtained
    and used to dynamically determine the boundary and surface of Lake Chaohu, as
    introduced in step (1) in Section 5.1; (5) 3D underwater topography of Lake Chaohu
    with a scale of 1:2000 was used to generate the 3D model of the underwater topography,
    as introduced in step (2) in Section 5.1. 2.2. Satellite Remote Sensing of HABs
    in the Whole Lake HAB information, including both area and spatial distribution,
    was obtained automatically based on the satellite-based monitoring methods introduced
    in Section 5.2. The used satellite data sources include Terra/Aqua MODIS, Sentinel-2
    MSI and GOCI. An example of the satellite-based HAB monitoring is shown in Figure
    2, and the accuracy evaluation results is given in Section 2.5.3. Figure 2. The
    results of HAB monitoring with satellite remote sensing. (a) is the result of
    HAB monitoring (the accurate area of HABs is 6.51 km2), and (b) is the inversed
    result of the spatial distribution of Chl-a concentration. Note that the monitoring
    date is 17 September 2021 and the satellite data source is Aqua/MODIS. 2.3. Video-Based
    Real-Time Monitoring of HABs in Nearshore Areas There are forty-two land-based
    video monitoring devices around Lake Chaohu (Figure 1 and Figure 3a). From 8 a.m.
    to 6 p.m. every day, coverage ratios of HABs were monitored with each video device
    automatically and periodically (once per second). And the processes were executed
    only using browser-based front ends. With these land-based video devices, the
    real-time live situation (Figure 3b), the latest coverage ratio of HABs (Figure
    3c) and the long-term changing information of HABs (Figure 3d) were obtained.
    After obtaining the coverage ratios of HABs via the forty-two video devices, the
    present situation of HABs in the whole nearshore area of Lake Chaohu was generated
    with the Kriging Interpolation method (Figure 3a) and updated every second. Figure
    3. The results of HAB monitoring with video devices around Lake Chaohu. (a) is
    the present situation of HABs in the whole nearshore area, (b) is the real-time
    live situation in field, (c) is the monitoring result of HABs, and (d) is the
    long-term changing information of HABs. 2.4. Integrated Representation and Analysis
    of Multi-Source Monitoring Data Based on the constructed DTLF, HAB information
    acquired with satellite remote sensing, land-based video monitoring and in situ
    monitoring was integrated and expressed in a 3D manner (Figure 4). HAB information
    in the whole lake, key areas and core positions can be grasped and visualized
    simultaneously. Moreover, based on the constructed DTLF (Figure 5), layer representation
    and section representation of water quality in the lake were achieved effectively
    (Figure 6). This can help managers of the lake water environment to understand
    the 3D spatial distribution of water quality in the lake, from both horizontal
    and vertical views. Figure 4. The results of multi-source HAB information integration
    and expression. (a,b) are the visualized results from the vertical view and the
    perspective view, respectively. Figure 5. The results of DTLF construction. (a–e)
    are the visualized results of the DTLF from the vertical view, the front view,
    the back view, the left view and the right view, respectively. Figure 6. The results
    of the multi-dimensional analysis of water quality in the constructed DTLF, and
    the Chl-a concentration is taken as the example parameter. (a) is the visualized
    result of the DTLF from the vertical view, and the red dashed line denotes the
    section position (the section analysis results is shown in (b)). (c–e) are the
    layered analysis results of various water depths, i.e., 0.5 m, 1.0 m and 1.5 m,
    respectively. 2.5. Evaluation Results of Efficiency, Effect and Accuracy 2.5.1.
    Efficiency Evaluation The efficiencies of HAB monitoring with satellite remote
    sensing and video monitoring were evaluated in this paper. The used server configuration
    is shown in Table 1, and the results of the efficiency evaluation are shown in
    Table 2, indicating that the efficiencies of HAB monitoring in this paper are
    quite satisfying, and can fully meet the requirements for HAB management. Table
    1. The server configuration for efficiency evaluation. Table 2. The results of
    efficiency evaluation. 2.5.2. Effect Evaluation It can be inferred from Figure
    4 and Figure 6 that the designed functions, i.e., multi-source data integration,
    visualization and analysis were all implemented based on the constructed DTLF.
    Actually, the DTLF provided new techniques for lake water quality analysis such
    as layer representation and section representation that were difficult to achieve
    in traditional research. In summary, the results of the effect evaluation are
    quite satisfying. 2.5.3. Accuracy Evaluation Twenty points in Lake Chaohu were
    chosen to evaluate the accuracy of Chl-a concentration inversion using satellite
    remote sensing. The accuracy evaluation results are shown in Figure 7, indicating
    that the accuracy is high (MRE = 13.32% and R2 = 0.86). Figure 7. Accuracy evaluation
    results for Chl-a concentration monitoring with satellite remote sensing. Two
    thousand images captured with land-based video devices, i.e., validation data
    that do not participate in the training of the HAB monitoring algorithm, were
    used to evaluate the accuracy of HAB monitoring based on the video devices. The
    evaluation method will be introduced in Section 5.5. The evaluation result (F
    = 0.8552) indicated that the land-based video monitoring method can be used for
    HAB monitoring in lakes. 3. Discussion 3.1. Advantages of DTLF The DTLF design
    and application in Lake Chaohu demonstrated its high value in the monitoring and
    management of HABs in lakes. Firstly, different from traditional monitoring methods
    for HABs [14,18,24], this work aims to provide an efficient way to obtain the
    real-time situation of HABs in nearshore areas of lakes. From 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
    every day, coverage ratios of HABs in key nearshore areas can be accurately and
    frequently monitored (Figure 3). Supported by this function, the main drawbacks
    of the traditional inspection work for HABs in lakes, which consumes lots of manpower
    and resources, can be addressed thoroughly. Front-line workers can be freed from
    the onerous tasks of inspecting the whole nearshore area and only need to focus
    on several key water areas where HABs accumulate as monitored (Figure 3 and Figure
    4). Moreover, after the outbreak of HABs in lakes, nearshore areas usually become
    the places where HABs gather and secondary disasters occur. Considering this background,
    timely grasping of HAB information in nearshore areas is quite valuable for the
    prevention and control of HABs because disposal equipment for HABs, such as salvage
    equipment, can be allocated timely to key nearshore areas and the hazards caused
    by HABs can be decreased to the utmost extent. Additionally, multi-source data
    on HABs and water quality can be integrated and visualized in the DTLF, which
    is quite valuable for situation analysis and judgment of HABs in lakes, because
    comprehensive information about HABs, e.g., area, spatial distribution, etc.,
    can be acquired. Multi-dimensional analysis of water quality in the lake body
    can also be achieved, i.e., layered analysis and section analysis. This function
    can help water environment managers to grasp comprehensive information about lake
    water quality, for both the water surface and underwater spaces. This can improve
    the accuracy of situation analysis and judgment. For example, if there are no
    HABs gathering on the water surface but the concentration of Chl-a is high in
    the underwater space, it can be inferred that the risk of HAB occurrence is high
    in this area, and emergency plans can be developed in advance to reduce the potential
    harm. 3.2. Potential Applications of DTLF Although applied in Lake Chaohu currently,
    the constructed DTLF is transferable to other lakes and reservoirs. Despite being
    data-driven, the DTLF developed in this paper is generic and therefore should
    be readily transferable to other lakes and reservoirs when the following conditions
    can be satisfied: (1) There are available data sources from satellite remote sensing.
    As described in Section 5.2, area and spatial distribution of HABs in the whole
    lake are monitored with satellite remote sensing. And it is thus necessary that
    there are available data sources from satellite remote sensing. Considering the
    revisit cycles of satellites and the uncontrollability of meteorological conditions,
    there should be various data sources from satellites so that valid data on HABs
    in lakes and reservoirs can be obtained even when some satellites cannot obtain
    valid images. It can be accordingly inferred that the higher the number of data
    sources from satellite remote sensing, the better the application effect of the
    developed DTLF. (2) There is a certain number of monitoring equipment. Firstly,
    land-based video monitoring devices equipped with visible light cameras are essential
    for obtaining the present situation of HABs in nearshore areas of lakes and reservoirs.
    Considering the effect of DTLF construction, i.e., the monitoring of HABs in nearshore
    areas, the number of video devices should be determined by the shape and length
    of the lakes, the heights of the video device, the performance of the imaging
    equipment, etc. Based on practical experiences, it is suggested to deploy one
    land-based video device around the lake every 5 km. Moreover, a certain amount
    of in situ monitoring systems is necessary to frequently acquire key water quality
    parameters, such as Chl-a concentration, in core positions of lakes and reservoirs.
    Additionally, at least one water level monitoring station is necessary for dynamical
    monitoring of water levels and calculating the lake surface, as explained in Section
    5.1. All in all, the amount of monitoring equipment should be determined based
    on the areas and shapes of the lakes and reservoirs. And the more monitoring equipment
    and the more uniform their spatial distribution, the better the application effect
    for the developed DTLF. (3) There is detailed basic data materials for lakes (reservoirs)
    and watersheds. As described in Section 5.1, the construction of a DTLF needs
    support from basic data materials such as 3D terrain data for the watershed and
    a 3D model of the underwater topography of lakes. 3.3. Uncertainties in the DTLF
    and Future Work Although the constructed DTLF has several striking advantages
    as discussed in Section 3.1, it is important to note that there are several existing
    weakness/uncertainties. Some of them will require improvements in the future.
    (1) Video devices around lakes and reservoirs are presently exploited mainly for
    several purposes, such as illegal fishing monitoring, security monitoring, etc.,
    and it is quite difficult to keep the characteristics of the devices stable, resulting
    in uncertainties in HAB monitoring results. For example, for a fixed water area
    where HABs accumulate, the obtained coverage ratios of the HABs can be different
    by adjusting the angle of the video device; (2) In this DTLF, the present condition
    of HABs in nearshore areas can be obtained rapidly, automatically and periodically
    according to coverage ratios of HABs monitored with land-based video devices and
    the Kriging Interpolation method. Although this is quite valuable for HAB management
    practices, there are several factors which can affect the obtained present condition
    of HABs, such as the uncertainty of HAB distribution, the limited monitoring ranges
    and the multi-purpose nature of the video devices, etc. (3) Although the DTLF
    can be constructed and dynamically refreshed with dynamically monitored water
    levels as explained in Section 5.1, the used water levels were assumed to be planar,
    which is not reasonable, especially in large lakes or reservoirs. Moreover, the
    waves were not used when constructing the DTLF, and there is a certain disconnect
    between the DTLF and the real lake body. 4. Conclusions A novel digital twin lake
    framework (DTLF) was constructed in this study for HAB monitoring and management.
    Our application case in Lake Chaohu revealed that the constructed DTLF can obtain
    HAB information in nearshore areas frequently (once per second from 8 a.m. to
    6 p.m. every day). Moreover, multi-source monitoring data on HABs and water quality
    can be integrated, represented and analyzed in a 3D manner, and the comprehensive
    situation of HABs and water quality in lakes can be obtained. More basic data
    materials, monitoring data on the water level and effective methods for wave simulation
    may help to improve the effects of DTLF construction. In addition, fixed spatial
    characteristics of land-based video devices can significantly improve the certainty
    and practicality of the results of HAB monitoring. Accordingly, we will pay more
    attention in future work to collect more basic data materials, simulate waves
    and structure video monitoring systems around lakes and reservoirs with fixed
    imaging postures. 5. Materials and Methods 5.1. Construction of the DTLF In this
    paper, a DTLF is defined as the digital counterpart of a real lake body. In theory,
    information of HABs and the water quality of a lake can be freely integrated,
    represented and analyzed in its DTLF. A DTLF of a lake can be constructed with
    3D terrain data on the watershed, water level and 3D underwater topography of
    the lake. For a specific lake, the process of DTLF construction (Figure 8) can
    be summarized with the following three steps: Figure 8. The process of DTLF construction.
    Note that the monitoring data on the water level are dynamic and thus the constructed
    DTLF is time-varying. (1) Dynamically determine the lake boundary and the lake
    surface. It can be inferred that the lake boundary and the lake surface vary with
    the changes of water level. In this work, a planar model is firstly generated
    according to the dynamically monitored water levels of the lake; the lake boundary
    is then determined by calculating the intersection line of the determined planar
    model and the 3D terrain data for the watershed. And the enclosed space of the
    determined lake boundary is considered as the lake surface; (2) Generate the 3D
    model of the underwater topography of the lake. A batch program is implemented
    and applied which can assign heights for all points in the underwater topography
    according to their elevations. And then the 3D model of the underwater terrain
    can be generated by fitting a curved surface based on all processed points; (3)
    Generate the final DTLF. Merge the obtained lake surface and the 3D model of the
    underwater terrain of the lake to generate the final DTLF. Considering the dynamic
    character of the water level, an algorithm is designed to refine the generated
    DTLF, i.e., (i) if the boundary of the 3D model of the underwater terrain is lower
    than the lake surface, i.e., there are empty areas between them, mend the empty
    areas with the 3D terrain data for the watershed, and (ii) if the boundary of
    the 3D model of the underwater terrain is higher than the lake surface, clip the
    3D model of the underwater terrain based on the lake surface, i.e., only keep
    3D points with heights less than or equal to the height of the lake surface. 5.2.
    HAB Monitoring throughout the Whole Lake via Satellite Remote Sensing The FAI
    index [29] was used in this paper for HAB monitoring based on satellite imageries
    including Terra/Aqua MODIS, Sentinel-2 MSI and GOCI. In addition, a satellite-based
    automatic method for HAB monitoring was designed and applied which can be seen
    in detail in [17]. With this method, the whole process of satellite-based HAB
    monitoring was completed without any artificial participation. 5.3. Video-Based
    Real-Time Monitoring of HABs in Nearshore Area of Lake After the outbreak of HABs
    in lakes, nearshore areas usually become the places where HABs gather and secondary
    disasters occur. Therefore, real-time monitoring of HABs in nearshore areas is
    quite valuable but the existing research cannot achieve this goal. In this paper,
    a video-based real-time monitoring method for HABs was designed (Figure 9) which
    can be summarized with the following three steps: Figure 9. The basic schematic
    diagram of video-based real-time monitoring of HABs in nearshore areas of lakes.
    Note that only browser-based front ends are used to display live video data, capture
    real-time images, identify HAB pixels and display the results of HAB monitoring,
    and the efficiency of HAB monitoring can be improved significantly because data
    transfer processes between front-sides and server-sides are avoided. (1) Obtain
    real-time images from video monitoring data via Canvas API [39], a new tag added
    in HTML5 for generating real-time images on web pages and manipulating image content.
    Canvas API is executed periodically with browser-based front ends and the period
    can be set as needed; (2) Develop a machine-learning-based algorithm for HAB identification.
    U-Net [40], a semantic segmentation model of digital images which can be trained
    with a small dataset, is used in this paper for HAB identification. Before formal
    application, the U-Net model was designed and trained via the following six sub-steps,
    i.e., (i) prepare original images captured with land-based video devices and the
    corresponding handmade label images (classify image pixels into HAB pixels and
    HAB-free pixels), and then divide these images into two groups, i.e., training
    data and validation data, (ii) preprocess the original images and label the images,
    such as cropping, scaling, normalization, etc., (iii) design the U-Net model,
    including the encoder and decoder, (iv) use the training data to train the designed
    U-Net model, including forward propagation, backpropagation and parameter updates,
    (v) use the validation data to validate the model and evaluate its performance
    and effectiveness and (vi) optimize the model based on the validation results,
    such as adjusting hyperparameters, adding training data, etc.; (3) Dynamically
    calculate the results of HAB monitoring. After each instance of HAB identification,
    the coverage ratio of HABs, i.e., the ratio of HAB pixels to the total pixels,
    is calculated. And the present condition of HABs in the whole nearshore area can
    then be obtained with spatial interpolation methods such as Kriging Interpolation.
    5.4. Integration, Visualization and Analysis of Multi-Source Monitoring Data (1)
    Integration and visualization of multi-source monitoring data. Based on the constructed
    DTLF, display the HAB data monitored with satellites, video devices and in situ
    stations in a multi-layer-overlay manner. To prevent multi-source HAB information
    from being obstructed, results of in situ monitoring, satellite remote sensing
    and video monitoring are placed in the back layer, the middle layer and the top
    layer, respectively; (2) Multi-dimensional analysis of water quality. Based on
    the constructed DTLF, the spatial distribution of water quality can be expressed
    in a 3D manner via spatial interpolation. And multi-dimensional analysis of water
    quality can be realized in the whole lake body, such as layer representation (visualize
    the horizontal distribution of water quality in different depths), section representation
    (visualize the vertical distribution of water quality in different sections),
    etc. 5.5. Performance Validation (1) Accuracy validation. Firstly, considering
    that the outbreak of HABs in lakes is closely related to the concentration of
    Chl-a in water bodies, Chl-a concentration obtained via in situ monitoring is
    used in this paper to validate the accuracy of satellite remote sensing. Moreover,
    F-score [41] is used to quantitatively assess the accuracy of video monitoring,
    which is defined as follows: ⎧ ⎩ ⎨       𝐹= 2×𝑃×𝑅 𝑃+𝑅 𝑃= 𝑇𝑃 𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑃 𝑅= 𝑇𝑃
    𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑁 (1) where TP (true positive) is the number of correctly identified HAB pixels,
    FP (false positive) is the number of HAB-free pixels which are identified as HABs,
    FN (false negative) is the number of HAB pixels which are identified as HAB-free,
    P (precision) is the proportion of correctly identified HAB pixels against identified
    HAB pixels, R (recall) is the proportion of correctly identified HAB pixels against
    true HAB pixels and F (F-score) is a balance of P and R, which is one of the most
    useful metrics to evaluate the performance of HAB extraction with land-based video
    monitoring devices; (2) Efficiency validation. Considering the dynamic variations
    of HABs, efficiency is a significant evaluation index for HAB monitoring methods.
    In this paper, consumed time is taken as the index for efficiency evaluation;
    (3) Effect validation. In this paper, effect validation contains two aspects,
    i.e., analysis function and visualization effect. The former verifies whether
    the designed functions, such as multi-dimensional water quality analysis, are
    implemented, and the latter validates the effect of multi-variate and multi-dimensional
    data integration and representation. Author Contributions Conceptualization, Y.Q.,

    data screening and quality assurance processing tool useful for both discrete
    and continuous data. This application serves both a field research project assessing
    salinity and methylmercury drainage load control options and the requirements
    of a public domain watershed-based water quality forecasting model used to provide
    decision support for short-term salinity management in the San Joaquin River Basin
    of California. The US Army Corps of Engineers HEC-DSSVue data management and visualization
    platform was enhanced in the former application with Python scripts that performed
    the basic data quality assurance functions. Analogous tools were developed for
    use on the HOSTGATOR cloud server using the same Python scripts and algorithms
    to migrate quality-controlled data directly to a server for use by the Watershed
    Analysis Risk Management Framework (WARMF) water quality forecasting model. The
    Python scripts for both applications are easily adaptable by other potential users
    who do not currently have the resources to implement an enterprise-level hydrological
    data management and real-time quality assurance software system. Introduction
    Improvements in the accuracy and reliability of environmental sensors and cellular
    telemetry and falling costs have increased their deployment for hydrologic and
    water quality monitoring (Bhardwaj et al. 2015; Demetillo et al. 2019; Faustine
    et al. 2014; Kotamaki et al. 2009; Rasin and Abdullah 2009; Randhawa et al. 2016).
    These deployments support the continuous operation of water quality simulation
    and forecasting models (Quinn and Hanna 2002; Quinn 2006). Tasks associated with
    continuous operation include (1) downloading continuous sensor data from data-loggers;
    (2) performing quality assurance and quality control on the downloaded data; (3)
    error-correcting data and interpolating missing data time-series measurements;
    and (4) uploading and archiving data sets at the appropriate time interval for
    use in numerical watershed simulation and forecasting models. Real-time data quality
    assurance is the most challenging of these common tasks or workflows. Although
    there are several popular commercial environmental hydrologic data management
    systems (such as WISKI, HYDSTRA, and AQUARIUS) that have been used to successfully
    complete this data quality assurance workflow, the high cost and complexity of
    these commercial software products, which sometimes require trained, dedicated
    staff, has limited their use. Small public and private water agencies, nonprofits,
    and private entities performing monitoring, can benefit from easy-to-implement
    and accessible data screening and management platforms in the public domain. This
    paper provides an overview of a system that has been developed in support of real-time
    water quality management in the western San Joaquin Valley, California, focused
    on agricultural and wetland salt loading to the San Joaquin River. Environmental
    sensor networks have been established and operational for more than a decade in
    this area (Quinn and Hanna 2002; Quinn 2006). The system makes use of state-of-the-art
    cellular telemetry and fully automated web-based data reporting. Cost is a big
    factor given that wetland entities such as private duck clubs and wildlife refuges
    do not generate income in the traditional sense—most of the 140,000 acres (64,000
    ha) of the contiguous grasslands ecological area (GEA) is dedicated to sustaining
    migratory waterfowl on the Pacific Flyway (Quinn and Hanna 2003). Small agricultural
    water district budgets are also insufficient to employ staff dedicated to hydrologic
    and water quality data quality assurance. Study Objectives This paper provides
    an overview of the workflows and software developed to achieve two main project
    goals. The first uses the public domain database and data visualization software
    HEC-DSSVue (USCOE 2009) to share data resources among scientists and wetland managers
    after performing customized real-time data screening and data quality control
    procedures. The second is to utilize the same customized quality assurance algorithms
    on a cloud platform (HOSTGATOR) to operationalize the Watershed Analysis Risk
    Management Framework (WARMF) model, a water quality simulation model (Herr et
    al. 2001) used to forecast San Joaquin River salt load assimilative capacity.
    The intent of this paper is to share the data-handling and data quality control
    workflows algorithms developed for these applications in the public domain and
    make them accessible to analysts and water managers tasked with similar compliance
    monitoring and decision support challenges. Although this system focuses on salinity
    and the management of salt loads, it has equal applicability to other constituents
    and pollutants. Application Setting The Grassland Water District (GWD) is a private
    entity that manages federal wetland water supply deliveries to 165 duck clubs
    and land and cattle operations in the GEA. The San Joaquin Valley Drainage Authority
    (SJVDA) oversees and coordinates agricultural drainage monitoring and compliance
    with San Joaquin River (SJR) water quality objectives. Both entities have developed
    telemetered real-time sensor networks that measure flow and salinity of canal
    water supply diversions and drainage export to the SJR. The sensor networks deployed
    in GWD and the SJVDA service area utilize a variety of water quality sondes manufactured
    by YSI (Xylem) (Yellow Springs, Ohio), In-SITU (Fort Collins, Colorado), and Sutron
    (Sterling, Virginia) to measure electrical conductivity (EC), temperature, and
    pressure head at 15-min intervals. Flow is measured certain monitoring sites using
    SONTEK acoustic Doppler transducers that utilize stage and velocity measurements
    to estimate current flow conditions. Both entities use Sutron X-Link 500 data-loggers
    to store the data and transmit the data via global system for mobile communications
    (GSM) and Code-division multiple access (CDMA) telemetry to both the HYDROMETCLOUD
    server, supported by SUTRON as a paid service. The SJVDA transmits the same data
    to HOSTGATOR, a cloud-based server that allows file transfer protocol (FTP) uploads,
    storage, and FTP export of processed data. Project Data and Data Management Requirements
    Continuous sensor data present a challenge due to the large amount of information
    that needs to be downloaded and postprocessed. Continuous sensor data can contain
    erroneous and/or missing data values due to telemetry issues, dead batteries,
    sensor drift due to biological fouling or sediment buildup on sensor electrodes,
    wiper malfunction, a sensor response time set too low, or unknown reasons (Plana
    et al. 2019; Horsburgh et al. 2015; Copp et al. 2010; Wagner et al. 2006). Erroneous
    and/or missing data need to be detected and removed or replaced. Discrete data
    collected for data quality assurance purposes typically contain fewer data points
    compared with continuous sensor data and can require different input formats (e.g.,
    replicates or blanks). Discrete data often contain metadata associated with each
    analyte and datapoint for quality assurance purposes that include method information,
    detection limits, and standard deviations of the data between replicates. HEC-DSSVue
    Software Software requirements for the project were to develop a public domain
    software solution for real-time data quality assurance that was easy to teach
    to university students involved in field research and to water district and agency
    project partners, and that could be readily replicated on project and cooperator
    computer platforms. The Java-based visual utilities program HEC-DSSVue was selected
    as the software platform that met most project requirements. The Hydrologic Engineering
    Center (HEC) of the US Army Corps of Engineers has developed water resources systems
    software for over 50 years focused on watershed hydrology, river hydraulics, and
    hydrologic data management. The DSS database is the core data management system
    for all HEC models and is especially efficient and flexible for time-series data
    storage and analysis. HEC-DSSVue is a visualization add-on that allows users to
    plot, tabulate, edit, and manipulate data in a HEC-DSS database file. There are
    large numbers of customized libraries accessible to programmers that provide enhanced
    functionality using Java, C, and C# (.net) programming languages. This functionality
    has been exploited on the project to develop a real-time data quality assurance
    capability. The same Java language scripts used to perform quality assurance functions
    including data interpolation, out-of-range data censoring, and rate-of-change
    error trapping have been exported for use as CRON (Unix-based chronological time-based
    job scheduler) jobs on the HOSTGATOR platform. HEC-DSSVue also provides utility
    functions allowing easy import and manipulation of data sets into the HEC-DSS
    database. The HEC-DSSVue database parses the data in a format that can be automatically
    uploaded into the WARMF model. This model is used for watershed drainage simulation
    and forecasting at key water quality compliance monitoring stations along the
    San Joaquin River. Real-Time Data Processing and Quality Assurance Workflow with
    Developed HEC-DSSVue Scripts The data management and data quality assurance workflow
    that was automated in HEC-DSSVue include tasks for data import, data screening,
    and correction of erroneous values (Fig. 1). These workflow subtasks are described
    in more detail in the subsequent subsections. Fig. 1. Flowchart showing workflow
    for data management of continues sensor data with HEC-DSSVue. Data Importing HEC-DSSVue
    offers two methods for importing a dataset: either through the user interface
    or through Java-based Python (Jython) scripting (HEC-DSS-Vue offers Jython scripting
    and HEC libraries to automate/customize tasks with programming). Generally, it
    is preferable to use the available data importing feature in the user interface
    due to its ability to detect errors in the imported data. If the number of individual
    data sets is large, importing through Jython scripting is preferable. For water
    quality data, the basic structure of a data set is a Time Series Container object,
    which contains information about the watershed, location, parameter, time interval,
    and a series of timestamps and recorded values. To import new data to a DSS file,
    the script reads the raw data and creates a Time Series Container for each data
    set, which is then saved to a DSS file under a unique pathname. Data Screening
    Data screening detects anomalies and replaces missing and rejected data with either
    a value based on linear interpolation, an average value, or a user-selected value.
    The customized user interface (Fig. 2), developed using the Java Swing library,
    allows users to visually acknowledge each modification of the data and have more
    control over the data screening process. A screening/replacing method is selected
    (Fig. 3), and the updated data plotted to visualize the modification. Fig. 2.

    original and final data columns and the dialog boxes for setting minimum and maximum
    data value thresholds and data value rate of change criteria that flags drift
    or sensor failure. Fig. 3. Dialog box for choosing data substitution options.
    The script for automated screening of data for erroneous values is a two-step
    process, as shown by the workflow in Fig. 1. The first data screening step in
    the workflow is a range check (maximum and minimum). Data values that fall outside
    a typical range for a particular site are removed (i.e., errors in data transmission
    result in large negative numbers that can be readily detected). The second step
    in the workflow is the adjacent value rate of change (absolute value or percentage).
    Rate of change is particularly useful for parameters with seasonal variations,
    e.g., temperature. The script allows to customize the rate of change by selecting
    the number of data points that are compared with each other. More sophisticated
    methods such as statistical analysis and machine learning (Moatar et al. 2001;
    Talagala et al. 2019) were beyond the scope of this project and likely too complex
    for the intended project users. Finally, the missing data gaps are filled via
    interpolation. The Python scripts were also tasked with other methods of filling
    in missing values via averaging or with user-specified data values. Data Screening
    Dashboard Functions A simple dashboard (Fig. 2) was developed to set data screening
    parameters for upper and lower data limits and rate of change criteria that would
    be indicative of sensor drift or failure. The definition of the various options
    shown in the dashboard is shown in Fig. 4. The dashboard dialog also allows plots
    to be made of the data time series to display the resulting time series once the
    data substitution and data overwrite operations have been completed. Fig. 4. Definitions
    of the various options shown on the data screening and data quality assurance
    dashboard. Data Substitution Options A separate dialog box is provided to define
    the data range for application of the data screening criteria (Fig. 5). This dialog
    box also allows the user to choose between automated linear interpolation, the
    use of average values, or the acceptance of a user specified value. The specific
    field circumstance will determine which one of these options is most appropriate.

    criteria. Additional Options for Customizing Quality Assurance (QA) Workflow A
    number of visualization options have been added to allow color-coding of various
    data elements to make the final time-series table easier to interpret (Fig. 6).

    Data Quality Assurance and WARMF Model Updating on the HOSTGATOR Cloud Server
    To aid data screening and automation of WARMF model updates for model-based forecasting,
    a data quality assurance workflow analogous to the workflow presented previously
    for HEC-DSSVue was developed (Fig. 7). HOSTGATOR is a commercial subscription-based
    data cloud storage platform that is customizable using Python and other similar
    scripting tools. The HOSTGATOR platform allows real-time data processing to convert
    15-min raw data to error-corrected daily mean values suitable for upload to the
    WARMF model. The WARMF water quality forecasting model requires a very large amount
    of 15-min, hourly, and daily mean data to run, and erroneous data can cause model
    crashes that can be time-consuming and expensive to recover from—sometimes requiring
    intensive troubleshooting. Although salt load assimilative capacity forecasts
    are currently made weekly, the goal is to develop a robust data quality assurance
    program that will allow daily forecast model runs. The same data processing Python
    scripts and algorithms were used in the HOSTGATOR implementation of the real-time
    data screening and quality assurance workflow. This ensures archival of the same
    data values whether processed and stored in the HEC-DSSVue database or in the
    WARMF model input data files downloaded from HOSTGATOR. Fig. 7. HOSTGATOR workflow
    to automate real-time sensor data migration and quality assurance as input to
    the WARMF model. GWD drainage data could be processed by HOSTGATOR for uploading
    to the WARMF model but would require that the CDMA (version modems) be replaced
    with CDMA (AT&T, Dallas, Texas) modems because the CDMA FTP messaging is incompatible
    with the HOSTGATOR incoming FTP server software. The added cost and potential
    disruption to current operations have delayed this transition. Raw sensor measurements
    from each SJVDA monitoring station are transmitted via cellular telemetry every
    15 min for drainage canal water level, water temperature, and EC in.csv file format
    (Fig. 7). A naming convention specifying the date and time of data collection,
    the parameter name and the value of the parameter was used. On the HOSTGATOR server
    the 15-min data are first scanned to check the validity of the data. Valid data
    have a numeric value that falls within a predefined range of reasonable values.
    Any invalid data are not included in the calculation of daily average flow, EC,
    and salt load. If no valid data are shown for any day, the average flow and salt
    load are left blank. This process is repeated for all monitoring stations Flow
    = 3.33 × weir width × ( stage − offset ) 1.5 (1) Salt load = Electrical conductivity
    × 0.64 (2) For those stations where acoustic Doppler transducers are deployed,
    the transducers compute flow internally from velocity and stage measurements and
    report these directly to the SUTRON data-logger and HOSTGATOR server. In this
    workflow, the daily salt load is calculated from valid flow and EC data for each
    15-min measurement period. On the HOSTGATOR server, the Python code and algorithms
    for data averaging and calculation of salt load are located in the CRON folder
    and executed daily. A CRON routine is a time-based job scheduler software program
    written as a UNIX script. The HOSTGATOR server provides its own graphical user
    interface for specifying each CRON job, allowing the application to run each data
    error-checking task and data-averaging task automatically at a specified date
    and time. Processed HOSTGATOR average daily flow, EC, and salt load output are
    loaded to an outgoing FTP directory after parsing into a.csv format suitable for
    uploading to the WARMF model directory as a WARMF model input file. The WARMF
    model web server schedules these FTP data downloads and updates the model input
    files automatically. On HOSTGATOR, data must be migrated from the Outgoing FTP
    folder to the Outgoing HTML folder (Fig. 7) to overcome known incompatibilities
    with the external WARMF model server. HOSTGATOR Data Processing Output An example
    of output from the HOSTGATOR server for the Hospital Creek monitoring site overseen
    by the SJVDA is shown in Fig. 8. Although this site is not a large source of salt
    load to the SJR, uncorrected positive and negative data spikes can compromise
    the ability of the WARMF model to accurately forecast salt load assimilative capacity
    at compliance monitoring stations. Simple and easy-to-implement quality assurance
    is a cost-effective way to improve forecast model performance and provide effective
    decision support for environmental water quality management. Fig. 8. Example of
    data screening to remove outliers and erroneous data points. The area between
    the lower and upper bounds represents the valid data range, and data outside of
    this range are outliers. Hospital Creek EC and stage (flow) data outliers were
    removed before calculating the mean. Summary and Conclusions This paper has described
    a public domain, interactive, and semiautomated data screening and quality assurance
    processing tool useful for both discrete and continuous data using the HEC-DSSVue
    data management and visualization platform. Analogous tools were developed for
    use on the HOSTGATOR cloud server using the same Python scripts and algorithms
    to migrate quality-controlled data directly to a server for use by the WARMF water
    quality forecasting model. The former application serves a research project directed
    at assessing salt and methylmercury drainage load control options. The latter
    application provides real-time data updates to the WARMF water quality forecasting
    model that is being used to provide decision support to assess short-term salinity
    control strategies and improve stakeholder-led salinity management. The Python
    scripts for both applications are easily adaptable by other potential users who
    do not currently have the resources to implement an enterprise-level hydrological
    data management and real-time quality assurance software system. Data Availability

    online in accordance with funder data retention policies and the objectives of

    IEEE Conference Location: Cox''s Bazar, Bangladesh SECTION I. Introduction The
    agriculture field, with its decisive involvement in upholding our mundane lives
    through the inclusion of indispensable food and raw materials, looms as one of
    the world''s most imperative concerns. In pursuit of sustainable agricultural
    practices and enhanced productivity, the concept of smart farming, also known
    as smart agriculture, has surfaced in recent times. The emergence of smart agriculture
    has helped promote sustainable practices and increased productivity. Smart agriculture
    includes the utilization of progressed innovations, strikingly the Internet of
    Things (IoT), which radically increments effectiveness and diminishes rural hones
    costs. The IoT is a network of devices that are competent in collecting and transmitting
    information over the internet. Several industries are currently embracing automation
    and IoT technology. One among these is Industry 4.0, an advancement including
    an assortment of aspects such as sensors, equipment, and IT systems that will
    be networked across the product value chain, removing obstacles to communication
    between divisions, firms, and customers. Agricultural and poultry operations are
    also key areas for the use of IoT since they play a vital role in the economy.
    IoT sensors are capable of delivering data about all aspects of farming, from
    machine performance to supply chain operations. According to a report by Allied
    Market Research, the worldwide IoT in farming market estimate is anticipated to
    reach USD 48.71 billion by 2025, developing at a CAGR of 14.7% from 2018 to 2025
    [1]. The utilization of IoT innovation in farming has the potential to revolutionize
    the division by making strides in effectiveness, lessening costs, and advancing
    economic hones. Therefore, businesses all over the world have used Internet of
    Things (IoT) technology to improve agricultural and poultry farming domains by
    making them smarter, more effective, and more productive, decreasing manual duties
    and maximizing time and financial resources. Sensors (for the management of soil
    to monitor pH level, temperature, humidity, and so on), actuators, systems for
    navigating, cloud-based data services, and drones allow new analyses that might
    drastically impact these critical sectors that comprise the IoT technology stack.
    Environmental monitoring plays a vital role in the realm of smart farming, encompassing
    the surveillance of crucial factors like temperature, humidity, and air quality.
    Among the various sectors poised to reap substantial benefits from IoTdriven environmental
    monitoring, poultry farming holds particular promise [2], [4]. Poultry farming
    implies the rearing of avian birds, including chickens, ducks, and turkeys, for
    the purpose of meat or egg production. Maintaining optimal environmental conditions,
    including temperature and humidity levels, stands as a paramount requirement for
    the prosperity of poultry. In this paper, we present an IoT-based smart farming
    automation system tailored to cater to enhancing productivity in poultry farming.
    Our advocated system boasts an array of sensors calibrated to monitor temperature
    and humidity within poultry farms, alongside rain and flood proximity exerting
    a crucial influence on the welfare of the poultry. The system incorporates Wi-Fi-based
    monitoring capabilities, automatic food and water supply mechanisms, and automated
    curtain features whenever rainfall happens. On top of that, there’s an alert system
    for alerting the personnel if there’s an extreme environmental issue or shortage
    in food and water storage as well as a data-driven predictive model to suggest
    future trends. These advancements collectively contribute to truncating labor
    expenses and reinforce productivity. The remainder of this article is organized
    as follows: Section II discusses and analyzes the existing systems and related
    literature. Section III presents the main functionalities of the proposed system.
    Section IV discusses the prototype scenario including mobile application UI and
    breakdown of data analytical web server. Finally, some concluding observations
    and a way forward are offered in Section V. SECTION II. Related Work The agriculture
    sector, especially in predominantly agricultural nations like Bangladesh, stands
    at a critical juncture. Traditional farming practices, though rooted in historical
    significance, often hinder the nation''s agrarian progress. Addressing these challenges,
    especially in poultry productivity, a surge in studies has emerged, underlining
    the potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) in revolutionizing agricultural
    practices [4]. Yet, a comprehensive survey suggests that the application of IoT
    in agriculture is still in its nascent stages, with ample avenues for exploration
    and innovation [5]. According to M. Bacco et al. [6], the present era, heralded
    as the age of technological fusion, has rendered smart farming increasingly accessible
    and efficient. Such advancements are transforming agricultural processes to become
    more automated, minimizing human intervention, guaranteeing higher yields, and
    ensuring optimal resource allocation. Several studies [7], [8] have found automation
    as an intriguing approach to boosting the efficiency and yield of smart farms.
    These studies highlight the positive aspects of using the ESP32 microcontroller
    in smart farming systems because of its interoperability with multiple interfaces
    like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, enabling smooth integration with module sensors [3],
    [7]. As demonstrated in [9], the DHT11 sensor, which is backed by the ESP32, has
    proven handy for sensing temperature and humidity and relaying warnings to smartphones
    and impulses to buzzers. The work laid out in [10] also demonstrated the use of
    rain sensors for rainfall being spotted, as well as the inclusion of simultaneous
    versatile sensors. This amalgamation presents extensive surveillance of the environment
    in smart farms, leading to more effective control of water and irrigation processes.
    Another noteworthy application is the adoption of infrared (IR) sensors to detect
    food items by evaluating heat variations, as shown in [11]. Farmers may reliably
    determine fluctuations in temperature in food items by using infrared sensors,
    making it possible for effective inspection and preservation approaches. Along
    with this, Getu and Attia''s [12] autonomous water level sensor and controller
    system marks a substantial spring in smart farming. This device detects water
    levels in reservoirs and automatically refills them, maintaining a steady supply
    of water for farming operations. This solution demonstrates the possibility of
    automation to streamline the handling of water procedures in smart farms via the
    ESP32 controller alongside appropriate sensor modules. The blending of smartphones
    into farming methods has shown to be highly valuable, granting farmers several
    perks. A key benefit is being able to retrieve automated reports immediately on
    smart devices, thus real-time information is provided, and rapid decision-making
    can be conducted [13], [14]. Mobile applications have evolved into comprehensive
    ecosystems that support various aspects of farming, including precision agriculture
    monitoring [15]. These applications leverage wireless sensor networks to gather
    data and deliver valuable insights to farmers, enhancing productivity and efficiency.
    While the work described in [16] focuses on IoT-based automated curtain systems
    for smart homes, its potential application in the agricultural domain is noteworthy.
    By integrating rain sensors into the system, curtains could be controlled based
    on real-time rainfall detection. This intelligent automation would enable the
    curtains to open or close only when rainfall is detected, providing protection
    for crops or farm equipment and conserving resources by retracting the curtains
    when the rain stops. Wireless sensor networks have played a crucial role in monitoring
    and optimizing farming operations in the domain of precision farming. The research
    work presented in [13] provides a wireless sensor network (WSN)-based precision
    agricultural surveillance system. Essential characteristics like moisture in the
    soil, temperature, and humidity may be continually tracked by placing WSN nodes
    across the farming land. This constantly updated information empowers farmers
    to come up with smart irrigation, fertilizer use, and control of pests choices
    eventually enhancing the yield of crops and the consumption of resources. Comparably,
    the research referred to in [14] is concerned with the implementation of a precision
    farming tracking system based on networks of wireless sensors. The system gathers
    data from numerous sensors installed in the vicinity and wirelessly transmits
    it to a central monitoring location. Farmers can apply the obtained data to examine
    environmental conditions while implementing accurate modifications to farming
    techniques. This system improves the total effectiveness of farm operations and
    fosters sustainable farming practices through using WSN technology. Braun, Carbon,
    and Naab [15] proposed a pilot study of a mobile app network created exclusively
    for smart farming in the course of their research. The system includes many features,
    such as real-time monitoring, analysis of data, and tools for supporting decisions,
    all of which are available via a mobile application. The producers can employ
    this multifaceted approach to consolidate their operations, increase production,
    and maximize the allocation of resources. The use of mobile apps in farming is
    a growing trend, providing farmers with convenient access to valuable information
    and promoting efficient farm management. The integration of web platforms, as
    highlighted by Colezea et al. [17], has the potential to significantly enhance
    agricultural yields. These platforms, accessible with a basic internet connection,
    offer remote monitoring capabilities, empowering farmers to manage their operations
    from virtually anywhere. This streamlines farm management processes and drives
    optimal productivity. However, despite these advancements, there remains a pressing
    need for all-encompassing systems tailored to address the distinct challenges
    of specific agricultural sectors, like poultry farming. This study aims to bridge
    this gap by leveraging IoT and data analysis to enhance poultry farm management.
    SECTION III. Proposed System The proposed system oversees plenty of different
    aspects, including environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and
    rain proximity, as well as manual obligations such as food and water refilling,
    water delivery systems, and curtaining when rain strikes. Figure 1 shows the workflow
    of these processes. Also, this solution encompasses data storing and data analytics
    facilities to map future production projections. This system efficiently reduces
    the need for manual intervention through comprehensive surveillance and automation,
    thereby decreasing personnel requirements. Figure 1: System Overview of IoT-based
    Automated Farm Show All The usage of this automated system not only promotes the
    health and growth of the chicken, but it may also increase egg production if any
    mishap does not occur. A dedicated website and mobile application have been developed
    to facilitate effective management, allowing real-time monitoring of farm activities
    and interior environmental conditions. A. Automated Refilling Food System Timely
    nourishment is vital for poultry''s growth and health. To this end, an infrared
    (IR) sensor (Figure 1) is integrated to discern food levels in the serving tray.
    Should the food level deplete, the system triggers an automatic refill, minimizing
    manual monitoring. Such automation reduces food wastage and optimizes resource
    utilization. B. Monitoring and Alarming Food Stockage A pivotal aspect of this
    system is its ability to preemptively alert farm administrators about dwindling
    food stocks. Employing IR sensors, it vigilantly assesses food storage levels.
    On detecting a shortage, instant alerts are dispatched, facilitating swift replenishment
    and minimizing disruptions in feeding routines. C. Automatic Water Management
    System Our system additionally incorporates an automated drinkable water level
    inspection system to ensure that the chickens have an uninterrupted water supply.
    The mechanism contains a water level sensor that consistently monitors the level
    of water in the water serving tray and the main tank. When a water deficit is
    identified, the system straightaway acts and restocks the water pot from the main
    water tank or if the main tank is empty, it will give off alarm. By automating
    this procedure, our system ensures that the chickens maintain their health and
    hydration. Such automation safeguards poultry hydration, obviating manual inspections.
    D. Temperature and Humidity Detection System We present a temperature and humidity
    monitoring module, amalgamating sensors with real-time alerts. This module assiduously
    tracks ambient conditions, alerting users to anomalous spikes. This paves the
    way for fast action and preventive efforts to reduce possible threats and maintain
    ideal circumstances. Users receive the alerts via diverse channels, including
    mobile notifications and web-based prompts, all encapsulated within an intuitive
    interface. E. Automatic Curtaining during Rainfall Weather volatility is addressed
    in our system through an innovative automatic curtaining process. Upon sensing
    rainfall via dedicated sensors, the system actuates curtain deployment, shielding
    the farm and poultry. As conditions clear, the curtains retract, promoting natural
    aeration and sunlight access. Such adaptability minimizes potential weather-induced
    detriments. F. Data-Driven Web Server with Analytics Our proposed system also
    boasts a web server adept at storing and analyzing both historical and real-time
    farm data. By harnessing data scraping APIs, it merges in-farm data with external
    datasets, providing a holistic perspective on farming conditions aligned with
    wider agricultural trends. This extensive data pool allows the system to deduce
    actionable insights, such as optimal feeding times, derived from factors like
    temperature, humidity, and food consumption rates. These insights, presented via
    the web platform and mobile application, equip farmers with a data-driven foundation
    for decisions, aiming to boost productivity and yields. SECTION IV. Prototype
    Scenario The system implies the use of several sensors to constantly record all
    environmental conditions on the poultry farm. Figure 1 depicts the proposed system''s
    operational functionalities and Figure 2 expresses the circuit diagram of the
    components in-depth. An ESP32 is used to collect and interpret sensor data, allowing
    it to initiate suitable actions depending on what it has received and for the
    communication module. The system is designed to monitor three critical environmental
    factors: temperature, humidity, and rainfall, as well as specialized operations
    such as water level supervision, food restocking, and food storage. Figure 2:
    Circuit Diagram of IoT based Automated Farm Show All If the temperature and humidity
    levels exceed the normal range, the farm owner will be informed via the mobile
    app and web app. If there''s a decrement in the water level within the water pot
    and water tank, then a water pump will automatically restore the water level from
    the main tank for the water pot and an alarm system is triggered to alert the
    farm owner for the water tank respectively. When rain is detected, an automated
    mechanism involving a servo motor and automation is initiated, deploying the curtains
    to shield the poultry from the precipitation. Once the rain subsides, the curtains
    are automatically retracted. A. Microcontroller and Communication The Arduino
    Uno is a particular sort of microcontroller. It comes in handy to regulate sensors
    and other electrical gadgets used to control the automation of corresponding variables.
    Here the Arduino Uno is used for testing and interfacing with various sensors.
    It is also inexpensive, simple for users to use, and offers a plain-sailing programming
    language. After successful first phase testing, we moved to ESP32 (MCU) which
    acts as a brain of our system. With versatility, it can serve as an independent
    system as well as a slave device to a host MCU. This twofold competence shrinks
    communication stack overhead on the main application processor, hence improving
    overall system performance. The ESP32 has SPI/SDIO or I2C/UART interfaces, allowing
    for convenient interfacing with other systems. The ESP32 could provide crucial
    functionality such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth via these interfaces, enhancing the
    total system''s connectivity choices and traits. B. Sensor Modules DHT11: This
    sensor; Figure 3(i), keeps track of and archives temperature and humidity levels,
    giving critical data for monitoring the environment on the farm. Rain Sensor:
    The rain proximity detector sensor; as in Figure 3(ii), detects rainfall and initiates
    the automatic curtain mechanism, ensuring the poultry is shielded during adverse
    weather conditions. When the rain stops, the sensor promptly signals the system
    to retract the curtains. IR Sensor: The infrared sensor detects mobility as well
    as quantifying the heat of a substance. It is placed on top of the food serving
    tray, indicating food levels in the tray and signaling when refills are necessary.
    It also plays a pivotal role in monitoring food stockage levels and sending alarms.
    A representation of the sensor is provided in Figure 3(iii). Water Level Sensor:
    This sensor customizing a set of wires ensures sufficient water reserves by monitoring
    the main tank and guaranteeing a consistent water supply. Also, it ensures the
    water level is kept within the necessary range in water pots, triggering initiatives
    such as resupplying water trays once the volume drops beneath a particular threshold.
    Figure 3: i) DHT11 ii) Rain Sensor iii) IR Sensor Show All C. Automation and Control
    Systems 4-Channel Relay Module: The module comprises four 5V relays alongside
    the pivotal switching and isolation components. It conveniently connects and interfaces
    with sensors or microcontrollers by seeking fewer components and connections.
    Servo Motor: In the automatic curtaining function, a servo motor is installed
    to allow for precise and controlled movement of the curtains, enabling smooth
    opening and shutting of the curtains in accordance with observed weather conditions.
    Automated Refilling Systems: This mechanism ensures automatically refills food
    trays and water pots based on sensor feedback. Web App: The web-based system incorporates
    a simplistic web application that makes it possible for the poultry farm owner
    to have access to and keep an eye on data transmitted by the ESP32 module. This
    web app works as a centralized platform alongside the mobile app for real-time
    monitoring of the internal environment and tracking of operations on the farm,
    accessible from anywhere whatsoever at any moment. The HTTP GET Request function
    is used to simplify communication between the device and the web app. The ESP32
    module sends queries to the web app on a regular basis, fetching certain values
    required to work properly. Each sensor is specified independently, ensuring that
    data from several sensors is accurately sent. Similarly, each of the four relays
    is defined separately, allowing for autonomous control of various electrical equipment
    in the smart farm automation system. The following Figure 4 outlines the user
    interface. Mobile App: We have assembled a mobile app using the Flutter framework
    based on the advocated system, which would offer equivalent features to the web
    app and offer farm owners real-time data on the go using their mobile devices.
    The app provides control over the system even without an active internet connection
    utilizing Bluetooth connectivity. The cross-platform features of Flutter will
    mitigate the necessity for distinct development for both iOS and Android. Figure
    5 portrays a glimpse of the mobile app''s UI and features. Figure 4: Web App User
    Interface Show All D. Data Management and Minimum Viable Product Our advocated
    system incorporates four essential pieces, which are an IoT device, a server,
    a database, and a user interface. The IoT device encloses sensors and actuators
    to scrutinize and regulate the poultry farm''s environment monitoring system.
    A dedicated server processes and stores the data relayed by sensors. This historical
    data, visualized in Figure 6, offers valuable insights for farm optimization.
    Data is not just accumulated but also analyzed, offering predictive models, recommending,
    and ensuring the IoT device works according to the user’s need. The database is
    a relational database that maintains a history of events and information for poultry
    farm management. As for the user interface, two applications are currently available
    that grant users access to reports generated by the server. These applications
    include Android mobile and web-based applications, providing easy and convenient
    access to the necessary reports. It can send commands to the IoT device. The user
    can view the current and historical weather data and other information, such as
    poultry health and productivity, on both the mobile and web apps. The user can
    also send commands like controlling the curtains of the poultry house through
    the user interface. The commands are sent to the server, validated, and forwarded
    to the IoT device. The IoT device executes the commands by activating the corresponding
    act. Figure 7 depicts the minimum viable product in both plugged and unplugged
    modes. The prototype outlined embodies the seamless integration of discussed technologies
    into the age-old practice of poultry farming, ensuring optimal management, real-time
    decision-making, and enhanced productivity. Figure 5: Mobile Application UI Show
    All Figure 6: Data-Driven Web Server Show All Figure 7: System Prototype, (top)
    off mode, (down) on mode Show All SECTION V. Conclusion and Future Scope From
    our observations, the prototype of the proposed system has been tested and proven
    successful. From a small-scale integration perspective, the prototype is made
    and an insight into the feasibility of large-scale integration and production
    is studied. The reading that we got from the sensors of the prototype is accurate
    along with the automation of the mechanical parts. Our future work is to make
    a prototype of a large scale, but appropriate funding is needed so that we can
    make it work. One area of future work involves exploring the conversion of chicken
    feces into reusable green energy through biogas automation. Biogas can be produced
    and utilized as an alternative energy source by harnessing the ammonia content
    in chicken waste. As there is a potential market, there is a chance for exporting
    ammonia to energy, fertilizer, plastic, fabrics, chemicals, and other companies
    in exchange for monetary benefits, providing additional revenue streams for poultry
    farms. Automatic theft detection can also be integrated into the system using
    motion detection sensors. These sensors can detect unauthorized movements day
    and night, ensuring the farm''s and its assets'' safety. Automatic light control
    system can be handy as it enables farm owners to adjust the lighting system even
    when they are away, improving energy efficiency and convenience. Chickens are
    susceptible to multifarious diseases, which can be tricky to diagnose by observing
    individual ones. However, by using automated gait analysis, we can monitor the
    health status of chickens in a non-invasive and efficient way. It can help detect
    diseases that affect the birds'' locomotion, posture, or behavior. Addressing
    the challenge of reduced productivity in poultry farms, especially in developing
    regions, our system upholds the transition from traditional to smart farms. By
    automating essential farm tasks like food refilling, environmental monitoring,
    and adaptive responses to varying weather conditions, the system not only boosts
    productivity but also optimizes costs and reduces manual labor. As the agricultural
    sector continues to evolve, it''s paramount to raise awareness about these advancements
    in regions that stand to benefit the most. By democratizing access to such technologies,
    we can collectively usher in an era of accelerated, efficient, and sustainable
    farming practices. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More Like This

    farms. By leveraging AI algorithms, fish farmers can gain valuable insights into
    fish growth patterns, feeding behavior, and environmental factors affecting fish
    health. These algorithms can detect and predict anomalies, diseases, and stress
    indicators, enabling proactive interventions to mitigate health issues and reduce
    losses. One of the key applications of AI in aquaculture is the development of
    smart monitoring systems. These systems employ various sensors, cameras, and data
    analytics tools to continuously collect real-time data on water quality, temperature,
    oxygen levels, and fish behavior. AI algorithms analyze this data to identify
    deviations from optimal conditions and provide timely alerts to farmers, allowing
    them to take appropriate actions such as adjusting feeding schedules, modifying
    water parameters, or administering treatments as needed. Furthermore, AI-based

    can determine the most efficient feed formulation and feeding regimes, leading
    to improved growth rates and minimized environmental impact. Another significant
    aspect of AI in fish farming is disease detection and prevention. Through image
    analysis and pattern recognition, AI algorithms can identify early signs of diseases,
    parasites, or abnormalities in fish appearance and behavior. This enables prompt
    disease diagnosis and targeted treatment, reducing the need for excessive use
    of antibiotics and chemicals while improving fish welfare. In summary, the integration
    of AI techniques in fish growth and health status monitoring holds great promise
    for the sustainability of aquaculture. By leveraging AI's capabilities in data
    analysis, pattern recognition, and predictive modeling, fish farmers can optimize
    their practices, enhance productivity, reduce environmental impact, and ensure
    the welfare of farmed fish. However, continued research, data sharing, and collaboration
    between scientists, industry stakeholders, and policymakers are essential for
    harnessing the full potential of AI in achieving a sustainable aquaculture industry.

    The Future in Fishfarms: An Ocean of Technologies to Explore Chapter © 2023 Livestock
    and Aquaculture IoT Systems Chapter © 2021 Introduction Aquaculture, the farming
    of aquatic organisms, has become increasingly vital for meeting the growing global
    demand for animal protein and addressing food security challenges. As the aquaculture
    industry continues to expand, it faces various challenges, including optimizing
    fish growth and ensuring the health and well-being of the farmed fish populations.
    Sustainable aquaculture practices aim to minimize environmental impacts while
    maximizing productivity and profitability (Austin et al. 2022). In this context,
    the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) has shown great promise in revolutionizing
    fish growth optimization and health status monitoring, thereby contributing to
    the sustainability of aquaculture operations (Chen et al. 2023). AI refers to
    the development and application of computer systems capable of performing tasks
    that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving,
    and decision-making (Dellermann et al. 2019). In the field of aquaculture, AI
    techniques offer opportunities for real- time monitoring, data analytics, predictive
    modeling, and decision support systems, which can significantly enhance the understanding
    and management of fish growth and health (Mustapha et al. 2021). This research
    paper provides a comprehensive review of the role of AI in fish growth and health
    status monitoring in the context of sustainable aquaculture. Aquaculture practices
    aim to maximize fish growth rates while minimizing feed inputs, energy consumption,
    and environmental impact. AI techniques such as machine learning, genetic algorithms,
    and deep learning have been employed to develop models for optimizing feeding
    strategies, identifying optimal environmental conditions, and predicting growth
    trajectories (Chen and Gu 2020). By analyzing historical growth data, these AI
    models can learn and adapt to optimize feed management, water quality control,
    and environmental monitoring, leading to improved growth performance and resource
    efficiency (Bagheri et al. 2019). In addition to growth optimization, AI plays
    a crucial role in monitoring the health status of farmed fish populations (Yue
    and Shen 2022). Disease outbreaks can have devastating impacts on aquaculture
    operations, resulting in economic losses and environmental consequences (Abdelrahman
    et al. 2023). However, the aquaculture industry faces several challenges, including
    optimizing fish growth and ensuring the health and well-being of farmed fish (Sornkliang
    and Tongdee 2022). Efficient monitoring techniques are vital for sustainable aquaculture
    practices, enabling early detection of diseases, optimizing feeding strategies,
    and minimizing environmental impacts (Wang et al. 2021a). Traditional monitoring
    methods in aquaculture often rely on manual observations, which can be time-consuming,
    labor-intensive, and prone to human error. Additionally, these methods may not
    provide real-time data, limiting the ability to respond promptly to changing conditions
    and potential health issues (Wu et al. 2022). Therefore, there is a growing need
    for advanced technologies to enhance fish growth and health monitoring in aquaculture.
    Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative technology with significant
    potential for revolutionizing aquaculture practices. AI encompasses a range of
    techniques that enable machines to mimic human intelligence, learn from data,
    and make autonomous decisions (Janiesch et al. 2021). By leveraging AI, aquaculture
    operators can access real-time data, predictive analytics, and decision support
    systems, leading to improved productivity, sustainability, and profitability (Panudju
    et al. 2023). Machine learning, a subset of AI, enables systems to learn from
    data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. It can analyze
    large datasets, identify patterns, and generate models that facilitate accurate
    predictions of fish growth and health status (Burke et al. 2021). Genetic algorithms,
    another AI technique, mimic natural selection processes to optimize feed compositions,
    feeding schedules, and environmental parameters to maximize fish growth (Luna
    et al. 2019). Deep learning, a branch of machine learning, employs neural networks
    to extract complex patterns and relationships from large datasets. It has proven
    successful in various computer vision tasks, making it valuable for automated
    fish health monitoring. Computer vision techniques, enabled by deep learning algorithms,
    can detect visual cues of diseases or abnormalities in fish behavior and appearance,
    enabling early detection and timely interventions (Li et al. 2023). AI-based techniques,
    including disease detection and diagnosis systems, early warning systems, and
    behavioral analysis, provide tools for rapid and accurate disease identification,
    enabling timely interventions and minimizing the spread of infections (MacIntyre
    et al. 2023). Furthermore, AI can be used for real-time environmental monitoring,
    allowing for the early detection of changes in water quality parameters that may
    impact fish health. While AI offers tremendous potential for sustainable aquaculture,
    there are challenges that need to be addressed. These challenges include data
    availability, the interpretability of AI models, ethical considerations, and the
    integration of AI systems into existing aquaculture practices (Abangan et al.
    2023). Overcoming these challenges requires collaboration among researchers, industry
    stakeholders, and regulatory bodies to ensure the responsible and effective application
    of AI in aquaculture. In total, the integration of AI in fish growth and health
    status monitoring has the potential to revolutionize sustainable aquaculture practices.
    By leveraging AI techniques, aquaculture operators can optimize fish growth, improve
    disease detection and management, and minimize environmental impacts (Mustapha
    et al. 2021). The review paper will focus on the application of AI techniques
    for optimizing fish growth, detecting and diagnosing diseases, and monitoring
    the health status of fish in aquaculture systems. This paper will also explore
    various AI techniques, including machine learning, computer vision, and data analytics,
    that have been employed in aquaculture research and industry practices. It will
    analyze how these techniques have contributed to improving fish growth rates,
    enhancing feed management and optimization, and enabling early detection and diagnosis
    of diseases. Additionally, the paper will discuss the use of AI for environmental
    monitoring and water quality control in aquaculture systems. Ultimately, the adoption
    of AI in aquaculture can contribute to the sustainable production of seafood,
    enhance productivity, and support global food security. Sustainable aquaculture
    and its challenges (Fig. 1) Fig. 1 Challenges on sustainable aquaculture (Rguez-baron
    2019) Full size image Sustainable aquaculture, also known as sustainable fish
    farming, refers to the production of aquatic organisms in a manner that minimizes
    environmental impact, preserves biodiversity, and ensures the long-term viability
    of the industry. It aims to meet the increasing global demand for seafood while
    mitigating the negative effects on natural ecosystems and maintaining social and
    economic benefits (Reyers and Selig 2020). However, sustainable aquaculture faces
    several challenges that need to be addressed to achieve its goals. Some of the
    key challenges are: Environmental impacts: Aquaculture operations can have significant
    environmental consequences, such as water pollution, habitat degradation, and
    the introduction of invasive species. Excessive nutrient discharge from fish waste
    and feed can lead to eutrophication and harmful algal blooms. Sustainable aquaculture
    requires minimizing these impacts and developing environmentally friendly practices
    (El-Sheekh et al. 2021). Disease management: Fish health is crucial for the sustainability
    of aquaculture. Disease outbreaks can cause significant economic losses and negatively
    impact wild fish populations if pathogens spread beyond the farm (Cascarano et
    al. 2021). Effective disease prevention, early detection, and management strategies
    are essential to maintain the health of farmed fish and prevent the transmission
    of diseases to wild populations (MacAulay et al. 2022). Feed sustainability: The
    reliance on fish-based feed ingredients, such as fishmeal and fish oil derived
    from wild-caught fish, raises concerns about overfishing and the depletion of
    marine resources (Henriksen 2020). Developing alternative and sustainable feed
    sources, such as plant-based and insect-based feeds, is essential to reduce the
    ecological footprint of aquaculture and maintain the balance in the marine food
    chain (Colombo et al. 2022). Genetic interactions: Escapes of farmed fish and
    their interbreeding with wild populations can have genetic consequences, including
    reduced genetic diversity and loss of locally adapted traits in wild populations
    (Wenne 2023). Preventing escapes and managing the genetic interactions between
    farmed and wild fish are critical to maintain the integrity and resilience of
    wild populations (Thorstad et al. 2021). Resource use and efficiency: Aquaculture
    operations require significant amounts of water, energy, and other resources.
    Sustainable aquaculture aims to optimize resource utilization and minimize waste
    generation (Boyd et al. 2020). Improving production efficiency, water recirculation
    systems, utilizing renewable energy sources and offshore aquaculture can contribute
    to more sustainable practices (Bergman et al. 2020 and Austin et al. 2022). Social
    and economic considerations: Sustainable aquaculture should also address social
    and economic aspects, such as equitable distribution of benefits, fair labor practices,
    and the well-being of local communities (Cisneros-Montemayor et al. 2019). Ensuring
    that aquaculture operations provide socioeconomic benefits to local communities
    while respecting cultural values and supporting livelihoods is crucial for long-term
    sustainability (Troell et al. 2023). Addressing these challenges requires a holistic
    and integrated approach that combines scientific research, technological innovation,
    policy development, and industry collaboration (Austin et al. 2022). The application
    of advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence, can play a significant
    role in mitigating these challenges by enabling real-time monitoring, data-driven
    decision-making, and adaptive management strategies. By addressing these challenges,
    sustainable aquaculture can contribute to food security, reduce pressure on wild
    fish stocks, and promote the conservation of marine ecosystems. Importance of
    aquaculture in food security (Fig. 2) Fig. 2 Aquaculture for food security (Hasselberg
    et al. 2020) Full size image Aquaculture, or the farming of aquatic organisms
    such as fish, shellfish, and aquatic plants, plays a crucial role in ensuring
    global food security. As the world''s population continues to grow, the demand
    for nutritious food increases, and aquaculture provides a sustainable solution
    to meet this demand (Duarte et al. 2022). The importance of aquaculture in food
    security can be understood through the following points: Increasing protein production:
    Aquaculture contributes significantly to global protein production, particularly
    in regions where alternative protein sources, such as livestock, are limited (Sandström
    et al. 2022). Fish and other aquatic organisms are excellent sources of high-quality
    protein, essential fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals. By cultivating aquatic
    species, aquaculture provides an efficient means of producing protein-rich food
    (Kandathil Radhakrishnan et al. 2020). Diversification of food sources: Aquaculture
    diversifies the sources of food production, reducing reliance on traditional agriculture
    and wild fisheries. This diversification helps to alleviate pressure on land-based
    food production systems and wild fish stocks. It provides an alternative source
    of nutritious food, reducing the vulnerability of communities to food shortages
    and price fluctuations (Choudhury et al. 2022). Improved food availability and
    accessibility: Aquaculture helps increase the availability of fish and seafood
    products, making them more accessible to populations that may have limited access
    to marine resources (Clavelle et al. 2019). By establishing fish farms in inland
    areas or near coastal communities, aquaculture enhances local food security by
    providing a consistent and reliable source of seafood. Sustainable resource use:
    Aquaculture can be conducted in a more sustainable manner compared to traditional
    fishing methods. It allows for controlled and responsible production, reducing
    the pressure on wild fish populations and ecosystems. By cultivating fish and
    other aquatic organisms, aquaculture reduces overfishing, promotes biodiversity
    conservation, and preserves marine habitats (Sampantamit et al. 2020). Economic
    development and employment opportunities: Aquaculture contributes to economic
    growth and rural development by generating employment opportunities, particularly
    in coastal and rural areas (Barua et al. 2022). It supports livelihoods and income
    diversification for small-scale farmers and fishing communities. By fostering
    local economies, aquaculture plays a vital role in poverty reduction and improving
    the overall well-being of communities (Troell et al. 2023). Climate change resilience:
    Aquaculture can be adapted to climate change impacts more effectively than traditional
    fisheries. It offers opportunities to develop resilient farming systems, such
    as integrated multi-trophic aquaculture, where waste from one species becomes
    nutrients for another (Correia et al. 2020). Aquaculture systems can also be designed
    to minimize greenhouse gas emissions, conserve water resources, and adapt to changing
    environmental conditions (Austin et al. 2022). To maximize the benefits of aquaculture
    for food security, it is crucial to ensure that it is practiced in a sustainable
    and responsible manner. This involves addressing environmental impacts, improving
    feed efficiency, enhancing disease management, and promoting responsible governance
    and regulatory frameworks. By embracing sustainable aquaculture practices, it
    is possible to enhance food security, support economic development, and conserve
    natural resources for future generations (Austin et al. 2022). Challenges in fish
    growth and health monitoring (Fig. 3) Fig. 3 Fish growth tracking using AI (Chahid
    et al. 2022) Full size image Fish growth and health monitoring in aquaculture
    face several challenges that need to be addressed to ensure optimal fish production
    and well-being. Some of the key challenges in fish growth and health monitoring
    are: Early disease detection prevention and management: Diseases are a significant
    concern in aquaculture and can cause substantial economic losses. The prevention,
    early detection, and effective management of diseases are crucial for maintaining
    fish health (Diwan et al. 2022 and MacAulay et al. 2022). However, identifying
    specific pathogens, developing accurate diagnostic tools, and implementing appropriate
    disease management strategies can be challenging due to the diverse nature of
    aquatic pathogens and their interactions with the environment (Sonu and Chaudhary
    2022; Mandal and Ghosh 2023). Environmental monitoring and water quality control:
    Water quality plays a vital role in fish growth and health. Poor water quality,
    including factors like dissolved oxygen levels, temperature, pH, and pollutants,
    can negatively impact fish health and growth rates. Monitoring and maintaining
    optimal water quality parameters throughout the aquaculture system can be challenging,
    particularly in large-scale operations or in areas with limited access to clean
    water sources (Jan et al. 2021). Feed management and optimization: Proper nutrition
    is essential for fish growth and health. Developing appropriate feeding regimes,
    optimizing feed formulation, and ensuring efficient feed utilization are critical
    challenges in aquaculture (Munguti et al. 2021). Achieving the right balance between
    providing adequate nutrition to promote growth and minimizing waste and environmental
    impact requires a thorough understanding of fish species-specific nutritional
    requirements and the availability of sustainable feed sources (Bava et al. 2019).
    Individual fish monitoring: Monitoring the growth and health of individual fish
    within a large population can be challenging. Traditional methods, such as manual
    measurements or visual inspection, are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may
    not provide accurate or real time information (Kumar et al. 2022). Developing
    non-invasive and automated monitoring techniques that can assess individual fish
    growth, behavior, and health status in a cost-effective and efficient manner is
    a significant challenge (An et al. 2021). Data management and analysis: Monitoring
    fish growth and health involves collecting and analyzing large amounts of data
    from multiple sources, such as water quality sensors, feeding systems, and health
    diagnostics. Managing and analyzing this data effectively can be complex and requires
    appropriate infrastructure, data integration, and advanced analytics techniques.
    Incorporating artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms can help
    in processing and interpreting the vast amount of data generated, leading to more
    accurate and timely insights (Javaid et al. 2023). Standardization and regulatory
    compliance: The aquaculture industry operates under various regulations and standards
    to ensure the health and welfare of farmed fish and to minimize environmental
    impacts (Van de Vis et al. 2020). However, achieving consistent and standardized
    monitoring practices across different regions and farms can be challenging. Ensuring
    compliance with regulations, maintaining data accuracy, and implementing uniform
    protocols for fish growth and health monitoring are essential challenges that
    need to be addressed (Mantri et al. 2023). Addressing these challenges requires
    continuous research and development, collaboration between researchers, industry
    stakeholders, and policymakers, and the adoption of innovative technologies. Advancements
    in sensor technologies, remote monitoring systems, data analytics, and artificial
    intelligence can play a crucial role in overcoming these challenges and improving
    fish growth and health monitoring in aquaculture practices. Need for advanced
    monitoring techniques The need for advanced monitoring techniques in aquaculture
    is driven by the increasing complexity and scale of aquaculture operations, the
    desire for sustainable practices, and the need to optimize fish growth and health.
    Advanced monitoring techniques offer several advantages over traditional methods
    and play a crucial role in addressing the challenges faced by the aquaculture
    industry (Saad et al. 2021). Some of the key reasons for the need for advanced
    monitoring techniques are: Real-time and continuous monitoring: Advanced monitoring
    techniques enable real- time and continuous data collection, allowing for immediate
    detection of changes or anomalies in fish growth, behavior, and environmental
    conditions (Ubina and Cheng 2022). This real- time monitoring helps in early identification
    of potential issues, such as disease outbreaks or suboptimal water quality, enabling
    prompt intervention and preventive measures. Enhanced accuracy and precision:
    Traditional monitoring methods often rely on manual measurements or visual observation,
    which can be subjective and prone to human error. Advanced monitoring techniques,
    such as automated sensors, imaging systems, and non- invasive biometrics, provide
    more accurate and precise measurements of fish growth, health parameters, and
    environmental conditions (Gladju et al. 2022). This enables better decision- making
    and targeted interventions based on reliable and objective data. Large-scale and
    remote monitoring: Aquaculture operations can span large areas, making it challenging
    to monitor every individual fish or environmental parameter manually. Advanced
    monitoring techniques, such as remote sensing, satellite imagery, and unmanned
    aerial vehicles (UAVs), allow for large-scale monitoring of fish farms and their
    surrounding environments (Mahrad et al. 2020). This enables comprehensive data
    collection, spatial mapping, and analysis, even in remote or inaccessible locations.
    Data-driven decision support: Advanced monitoring techniques generate large volumes
    of data, which can be analyzed using advanced data analytics, machine learning,
    and artificial intelligence algorithms (Kibria et al. 2018). By applying these
    techniques to the collected data, valuable insights and patterns can be extracted,
    enabling data-driven decision support systems (Wong and Wang 2003). This helps
    in optimizing feed management, disease prevention, water quality control, and
    overall operational efficiency. Sustainable resource management: Advanced monitoring
    techniques contribute to sustainable resource management by optimizing resource
    use and minimizing waste. Accurate monitoring of water quality parameters, feed
    intake, and growth rates allows for precise resource allocation and efficient
    use of feed, energy, and water (Cassman 1999). This reduces the ecological footprint
    of aquaculture operations and supports the development of sustainable practices.
    Finally, advanced monitoring techniques are essential in aquaculture to enable
    real-time, accurate, and comprehensive monitoring of fish growth, health parameters,
    and environmental conditions. These techniques empower data-driven decision-making,
    support sustainable resource management, enhance disease prevention, and optimize
    operational efficiency. By embracing advanced monitoring techniques, aquaculture
    practices can achieve improved productivity, increased profitability, and enhanced
    environmental sustainability. Artificial intelligence in aquaculture (Fig. 4)
    Fig. 4 Smart aquaculture system (Yue and Shen 2022) Full size image Artificial
    intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize various industries, including
    aquaculture. Aquaculture, also known as fish farming, involves the cultivation
    of fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and other aquatic organisms in controlled environments
    (Chauhan and Mishra 2022). By leveraging AI technologies, aquaculture practices
    can be enhanced in several ways. Here are some applications of AI in aquaculture:
    Data analysis and prediction: AI can analyze large volumes of data collected from
    various sources, such as environmental sensors, water quality monitors, and feeding
    systems. By using machine learning algorithms, AI can identify patterns and correlations
    within the data, allowing aquaculturists to make data-driven decisions (O''Donncha
    et al. 2021). For example, AI can predict optimal feeding times, growth rates,
    disease outbreaks, and environmental conditions for maximum productivity. Monitoring
    and surveillance: AI-powered cameras and image recognition techniques can be used
    to monitor fish behavior, feeding patterns, and overall health. By analyzing real-time
    video feeds, AI algorithms can detect abnormalities or signs of stress in the
    fish population (Mustapha et al. 2021). This enables early intervention, such
    as adjusting feeding regimes or treating diseases promptly. Water quality management:
    Maintaining optimal water quality is crucial for the health and growth of aquatic
    organisms. AI systems can continuously monitor parameters such as temperature,
    pH, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient levels (Kaur et al. 2023a). By integrating
    data from sensors and applying AI algorithms, aquaculturists can identify deviations
    from the ideal conditions and take corrective measures in real time, thereby reducing
    the risk of fish mortality and improving overall productivity (Gladju et al. 2022).
    Inventory management: AI can assist in managing stock levels and inventory in
    aquaculture facilities. By analyzing growth rates, feeding patterns, and market
    demand, AI algorithms can provide insights into optimal stocking densities, harvest
    timings, and production planning (Gladju et al. 2022). This helps aquaculturists
    optimize resource utilization and maximize profitability. Overall, AI has the
    potential to improve efficiency, sustainability, and productivity in aquaculture.
    By leveraging advanced analytics, real-time monitoring, and predictive capabilities,
    AI can empower aquaculturists with valuable insights and tools to make informed
    decisions and mitigate risks in fish farming operations. Overview of artificial
    intelligence (Fig. 5) Fig. 5 Evolution of AI in aquaculture (Shukla Shubhendu
    and vijay 2013) Full size image Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the development
    of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.
    AI systems are designed to simulate cognitive functions such as learning, reasoning,
    problem-solving, perception, and language understanding (Wu et al. 2021). AI technologies
    have made significant advancements in recent years, enabling machines to process
    and interpret vast amounts of data, recognize patterns, and make informed decisions.
    AI can be broadly categorized into two types: Narrow AI and General AI. A). Narrow
    AI: Also known as weak AI, narrow AI is designed to perform specific tasks within
    a limited domain. Examples of narrow AI include voice assistants like Siri and
    Alexa, recommendation systems, image recognition software, and autonomous vehicles
    (Prentice 2023). These AI systems excel at specific tasks but lack the broader
    cognitive abilities of human intelligence. B). General AI: General AI, also referred
    to as strong AI or artificial general intelligence (AGI), represents AI systems
    that possess the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across multiple
    domains, much like a human being (Latif et al. 2023). General AI is hypothetical
    and remains an ongoing research goal. Key components and techniques used in AI
    development: Machine learning (ML): Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses
    on enabling systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly
    programmed. ML algorithms can identify patterns and make predictions or decisions
    based on training data. Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement
    learning are common approaches in ML (Sahoo et al. 2020). Deep learning: Deep
    learning is a subfield of ML that leverages artificial neural networks, inspired
    by the structure of the human brain. Deep learning algorithms, called neural networks,
    can process vast amounts of data and learn hierarchical representations, enabling
    them to perform complex tasks such as image and speech recognition (Sarker 2021).
    Natural language processing (NLP): NLP enables machines to understand, interpret,
    and generate human language. NLP techniques allow AI systems to process and analyze
    text, speech, and contextual information, enabling applications like language
    translation, sentiment analysis, and chatbots (Hariri 2023). Computer vision:
    Computer vision focuses on enabling machines to interpret and understand visual
    information from images or videos. AI systems employing computer vision can recognize
    objects, detect patterns, and analyze visual data, leading to applications like
    facial recognition, object detection, and autonomous vehicles (Kaur et al. 2022).
    Robotics: Robotics combines AI with physical systems to create intelligent machines
    that can interact with the physical world. Robotic systems often employ sensors,
    actuators, and AI algorithms to perceive their environment, make decisions, and
    manipulate objects (Beloev et al. 2021). Expert systems: Expert systems utilize
    knowledge representation and inference techniques to simulate human expertise
    in specific domains. These systems capture expert knowledge and provide recommendations
    or solutions based on that knowledge (Medsker and Bailey 2020). The applications
    of AI are diverse and rapidly expanding across various industries, including healthcare,
    finance, manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and entertainment. AI has
    the potential to revolutionize processes, improve efficiency, enable automation,
    enhance decision- making, and uncover insights from large datasets. However, the
    development and deployment of AI also raise ethical considerations, including
    privacy, transparency, bias, and the impact on employment. Addressing these challenges
    is crucial to ensuring that AI technologies are developed and used responsibly
    to benefit society as a whole. AI techniques for fish growth optimization (Table
    1) Table 1 AI techniques in fish growth and health monitoring Full size table
    Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can be applied to optimize fish growth
    in aquaculture systems. These techniques can help enhance various aspects of fish
    growth, including feeding strategies, water quality management, disease detection
    and prevention, and overall farm management (Wang et al. 2021b). Machine learning
    approaches There are several machine learning approaches that can be used for
    fish growth optimization. These approaches leverage the power of data analysis
    and predictive modeling to identify key factors affecting fish growth and develop
    strategies to optimize it. Here are a few commonly used machine learning techniques
    in this context: Regression models: Regression models are commonly used to predict
    fish growth based on various input variables such as water quality parameters,
    feeding regimes, and environmental conditions. Techniques such as linear regression,
    decision trees, or random forests can be employed to model the relationship between
    these factors and fish growth (Wu et al. 2021). These models can provide insights
    into which variables have the most significant impact on growth and can be used
    to optimize feeding strategies, water quality management, and other factors affecting
    growth. Neural networks: Neural networks, particularly deep learning architectures,
    can be utilized to analyze complex and large-scale datasets related to fish growth.
    These models can capture intricate relationships between multiple input variables
    and fish growth, allowing for accurate predictions and optimization (Lashari et
    al. 2019). Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be employed for image-based
    analysis, such as assessing fish body condition or identifying diseases that may
    affect growth (Kaur et al. 2023b). Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are useful
    for time-series data analysis, enabling the prediction of growth trajectories
    and identifying growth patterns. Genetic algorithms: Genetic algorithms can be
    employed to optimize fish growth by iteratively searching for the best combination
    of factors. These algorithms simulate the process of natural selection and evolution,
    generating a population of potential solutions and iteratively improving them
    over multiple generations (Albadr et al. 2020). For example, genetic algorithms
    can be used to optimize feeding schedules, determining the appropriate amount
    and composition of feed at different stages of growth, to maximize fish growth
    rates (Luna et al. 2019). Reinforcement learning: Reinforcement learning is a
    machine learning approach that involves an agent learning how to make decisions
    in an environment to maximize a reward signal. In the context of fish growth optimization,
    reinforcement learning can be used to determine the optimal feeding strategy (Gladju
    et al. 2022). The agent interacts with the environment (e.g., fish tank) and learns
    which actions (e.g., feed amount, frequency) result in the highest growth rates
    (Aljehani et al. 2023). By optimizing the feeding strategy over time, the agent
    can maximize fish growth. Bayesian optimization: Bayesian optimization is a sequential
    model-based optimization technique that is particularly useful when the evaluation
    of each potential solution is time- consuming or expensive. It can be used to
    optimize parameters affecting fish growth, such as water temperature, pH levels,
    or stocking density (Zaki et al. 2023). By iteratively exploring the parameter
    space and using a surrogate model to predict the growth outcome, Bayesian optimization
    can efficiently identify the best parameter settings for fish growth (Chiu et
    al. 2022). These are just a few examples of machine learning approaches that can
    be used for fish growth optimization. The choice of approach depends on the available
    data, the complexity of the problem, and the specific goals of the optimization
    process. It''s important to note that while machine learning can provide valuable
    insights and optimization strategies, domain expertise and careful experimental
    design remain crucial for successful implementation in aquaculture settings. AI
    techniques for fish health status monitoring (Table 1) AI techniques can play
    a significant role in monitoring the health status of fish in aquaculture settings.
    By analyzing various data sources and patterns, these techniques can help detect
    early signs of diseases, assess overall fish health, and enable timely intervention.
    Disease detection and diagnosis (Fig. 6) Fig. 6 AI in fish disease detection (Paul
    2015) Full size image AI techniques can be effectively employed for disease detection
    and diagnosis in fish, helping aquaculturists and researchers identify and address
    health issues in a timely manner. Here are some AI techniques commonly used in
    this context: Image recognition and computer vision: Fish diseases often manifest
    as visual symptoms on the fish''s body, such as lesions, discoloration, or abnormal
    behaviors. Image recognition and computer vision techniques, including deep learning
    models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can be used to analyze images
    or videos of fish and automatically detect signs of diseases (Zhang et al. 2020).
    These models can learn from labeled datasets and classify fish images into healthy
    or diseased categories, aiding in the early detection of diseases. Pattern recognition
    and anomaly detection: AI algorithms can analyze patterns in fish health data
    to identify anomalies or deviations from normal conditions. This can involve monitoring
    water quality parameters, such as temperature, pH, ammonia levels, or dissolved
    oxygen, along with other variables like fish behavior or feeding patterns (Kaur
    et al. 2023b). By applying pattern recognition techniques, such as clustering
    algorithms or autoencoders, abnormal patterns can be detected, indicating potential
    diseases or stress conditions in fish populations. Expert systems and rule-based
    approaches: Expert systems combine domain knowledge and rules with AI techniques
    to diagnose fish diseases. These systems involve a knowledge base that includes
    information on various fish diseases, symptoms, and associated factors. By employing
    rule-based reasoning or decision tree algorithms, the system can ask specific
    questions about observed symptoms and guide the user to potential diagnoses and
    recommended actions for treatment or prevention (Nagaraj and Deepalakshmi 2022).
    Support vector machines (SVM) and classification algorithms: SVM and other classification
    algorithms can be used to analyze fish health data and classify fish into different
    disease categories. By training the models with labeled data representing healthy
    and diseased fish, the algorithms can learn to differentiate between various diseases
    based on input features such as water quality parameters, fish behavior, or molecular
    markers (González et al. 2023). These techniques can aid in accurate disease classification
    and subsequent treatment decisions. Time-series analysis and predictive modeling:
    Diseases in fish populations can exhibit temporal patterns and trends. Time-series
    analysis techniques, including autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA),
    recurrent neural networks (RNNs), or long short-term memory (LSTM) models, can
    be employed to analyze historical health data and predict future disease outbreaks
    (ArunKumar et al. 2022). By considering factors such as environmental conditions,
    water quality, and past disease occurrences, these models can provide valuable
    insights for disease prevention and management. It is important to note that AI
    techniques for fish disease detection and diagnosis are most effective when combined
    with domain expertise and validation from experienced aquaculturists or veterinarians.
    Integration of AI-based systems with real-time monitoring technologies, such as
    sensors or underwater cameras, can provide continuous surveillance and prompt
    detection of diseases, enabling early intervention and mitigation of potential
    losses in aquaculture operations. Environmental monitoring Artificial intelligence
    (AI) techniques can be utilized for environmental monitoring of fish to gather
    real-time data, analyze it, and make informed decisions for maintaining optimal
    conditions for fish health and well-being. Here are some AI techniques commonly
    employed for environmental monitoring of fish: Sensor data analysis: AI algorithms
    can process data collected from various sensors to monitor water quality parameters
    such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen levels, ammonia concentration, and turbidity.
    Machine learning models can be trained to recognize patterns and detect anomalies
    in sensor readings, providing early warnings for potential environmental issues
    that could impact fish health (Manoj et al. 2022). Image and video analysis: AI
    techniques, including computer vision, can analyze images or video feeds from
    cameras installed in fish tanks or ponds. These models can identify fish behavior
    patterns, detect signs of stress or disease, and monitor feeding activities. Additionally,
    image analysis can be used for automated fish counting and size estimation, providing
    valuable information for population management (Yang et al. 2021). Acoustic monitoring:
    AI algorithms can process underwater acoustic data to monitor fish behavior, migration
    patterns, and communication signals. Acoustic monitoring can help assess fish
    abundance, identify spawning grounds, and detect abnormal behavior or environmental
    disturbances (Li et al. 2022). Data fusion and integration: Environmental monitoring
    often involves collecting data from multiple sources, such as sensors, weather
    stations, and satellite imagery. AI techniques can integrate and analyze these
    diverse datasets to provide a comprehensive understanding of the fish habitat
    (Saleh et al. 2020). By combining data from different sources, it is possible
    to gain insights into the relationships between environmental factors and fish
    behavior or growth. Predictive modeling: AI models, such as machine learning algorithms,
    can analyze historical environmental data along with fish growth and health records
    to develop predictive models (Gladju et al. 2022). These models can forecast future
    environmental conditions, predict potential disease outbreaks, and optimize feed
    and water management strategies for maximizing fish growth. Decision support systems:
    AI techniques can be integrated into decision support systems for environmental
    monitoring of fish. These systems use real-time data, historical records, and
    predictive models to provide recommendations for optimal management decisions
    (Panudju et al. 2023). For example, AI-powered systems can suggest adjusting feeding
    rates, modifying water flow, or initiating interventions based on real-time environmental
    conditions and fish health indicators. Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs):
    AI can be employed to enable AUVs to autonomously navigate underwater environments
    and collect environmental data. AUVs equipped with sensors and cameras can monitor
    water quality parameters, observe fish behavior, and gather data in remote or
    hazardous areas. AI algorithms can process the collected data in real-time and
    transmit the information to the monitoring system (Ubina and Cheng 2022). These
    AI techniques enable continuous monitoring, real-time analysis, and proactive
    decision- making for maintaining a healthy environment for fish. By leveraging
    AI, environmental monitoring can become more efficient, accurate, and responsive
    to changes, ultimately promoting sustainable aquaculture practices. Water quality
    monitoring AI techniques can play a significant role in water quality monitoring
    for fish by automating the analysis of water parameters and alerting fish farmers
    to potential issues. Here are some AI techniques commonly used in water quality
    monitoring for fish: Sensor data analysis: AI algorithms can process real-time
    data from various sensors measuring water parameters such as temperature, pH,
    dissolved oxygen, ammonia, nitrate, and turbidity (Premkkumar et al. 2023). By
    applying techniques such as anomaly detection or pattern recognition, AI can identify
    abnormal readings or deviations from the optimal range, indicating potential water
    quality issues that may affect fish health and growth. Machine learning models:
    Machine learning algorithms can be trained on historical water quality data to
    develop predictive models. These models can forecast water quality trends and
    predict future values of key parameters based on historical patterns and other
    influencing factors (Wang et al. 2021a, b). By monitoring these predictions, fish
    farmers can proactively take preventive measures to maintain optimal water conditions
    for their fish. Image analysis: AI techniques, including computer vision, can
    analyze images or videos of the fish tanks or ponds to detect visual cues related
    to water quality. For example, changes in water color, presence of algae, or unusual
    fish behavior can be indicators of poor water quality. Convolutional neural networks
    (CNNs) can be trained to recognize and classify these visual patterns, alerting
    fish farmers to potential issues in real-time (Ben Tamou et al. 2021). Decision
    support systems: AI can be integrated into decision support systems for water
    quality management. By combining data from various sources, such as environmental
    data, water quality measurements, and fish health records, AI can provide recommendations
    on optimal actions to improve water quality based on predefined rules or learned
    patterns (Gladju et al. 2022). These systems can assist fish farmers in making
    informed decisions to maintain optimal conditions for fish growth. Internet of
    Things (IoT) integration: AI can be coupled with IoT devices and networks to create
    a connected water quality monitoring system. IoT sensors can collect data from
    multiple locations within the fish farm, and AI techniques can analyze this data
    in real-time. By leveraging AI algorithms, fish farmers can gain insights into
    water quality variations across different areas and identify potential hotspots
    of water quality degradation (Agossou 2021). Data fusion and integration: AI can
    help integrate data from multiple sources, such as sensor data, satellite imagery,
    weather data, and historical records, to provide a comprehensive understanding
    of water quality dynamics. By combining these diverse datasets, AI can identify
    correlations and patterns that may not be evident through manual analysis alone,
    improving the accuracy and effectiveness of water quality monitoring (Haluza and
    Jungwirth 2023). Overall, AI techniques can enhance water quality monitoring for
    fish by automating data analysis, enabling real-time detection of anomalies, and
    providing actionable insights to fish farmers. These technologies have the potential
    to optimize fish farming practices, minimize the risk of water quality-related
    issues, and improve fish health and growth outcomes. Applications of AI in fish
    growth optimization (Table 2) (Fig. 7) Table 2 AI in fish growth optimization
    Full size table Fig. 7 AI in aquaculture optimization (Vo et al. 2021) Full size
    image Feed management and optimization AI can be applied to feed management and
    optimization in fish farming to improve feeding efficiency, reduce costs, and
    optimize fish growth. Here are some key applications of AI in this domain: Feed
    formulation: AI can assist in optimizing the formulation of fish feed by considering
    various factors such as fish species, nutritional requirements, feed ingredients,
    and cost constraints (Glencross et al. 2023). Machine learning algorithms can
    analyze historical feeding data, growth rates, and nutrient composition to identify
    optimal feed formulations that meet the nutritional needs of the fish while minimizing
    costs (Siad and Bouzid 2023). These models can also take into account environmental
    conditions and feeding behaviors to customize feed formulations for different
    stages of fish growth. Real-time feed monitoring: AI techniques can be used to
    monitor feed consumption in real-time. Computer vision algorithms can analyze
    video feeds or images of fish tanks or ponds to estimate feed intake by tracking
    the movement and behavior of fish during feeding (Zhang et al. 2023). This information
    helps fish farmers assess feed utilization and adjust feeding strategies accordingly,
    ensuring that the right amount of feed is provided to the fish. Feeding optimization:
    AI can optimize feeding strategies by analyzing various factors such as fish behavior,
    growth rates, and environmental conditions. Reinforcement learning algorithms
    can be employed to develop intelligent feeding policies by learning from interactions
    with the environment (Xia et al. 2021). These algorithms can adjust feed delivery
    schedules, quantities, and frequencies to maximize fish growth while minimizing
    feed waste and the risk of overfeeding. Environmental monitoring: AI techniques
    can integrate environmental data such as water temperature, dissolved oxygen levels,
    and water quality parameters with feeding data to assess the impact of environmental
    conditions on fish feeding behavior and growth. Machine learning models can identify
    correlations between environmental variables and feeding patterns, helping fish
    farmers optimize feeding strategies based on the prevailing conditions (Chiu et
    al. 2022). Predictive modeling: AI can leverage historical data on fish growth,
    feed consumption, and environmental conditions to develop predictive models. These
    models can forecast future growth rates and feed requirements based on current
    conditions and historical trends. By providing accurate predictions, fish farmers
    can plan feed management strategies more effectively, optimizing feed supply and
    reducing waste (Mustapha et al. 2021). Automated feeding systems: AI can be integrated
    into automated feeding systems to optimize feed delivery based on real-time data.
    These systems can use machine learning algorithms to adaptively adjust feed quantities
    and feeding schedules in response to changes in fish behavior, growth rates, or
    environmental conditions (Hu et al. 2022). By continuously learning from data,
    these systems can improve feeding efficiency and reduce manual intervention. The
    application of AI in feed management and optimization of fish can significantly
    improve efficiency, reduce costs, and optimize fish growth in aquaculture operations.
    By leveraging data analysis, machine learning, and automation, fish farmers can
    make informed decisions, ensure optimal nutrition, and enhance the overall productivity
    and sustainability of fish farming practices. Water quality control In the context
    of water quality control for fish, AI can be applied in several ways to ensure
    optimal conditions and prevent adverse effects on fish health. Here are some specific
    applications of AI in water quality control for fish: Real-time monitoring: AI
    algorithms can process real-time data from sensors measuring water quality parameters
    such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, ammonia, and nitrate levels. By continuously
    analyzing these data streams, AI can detect anomalies or deviations from desired
    thresholds that may indicate poor water quality. Real-time monitoring allows for
    immediate response and corrective actions to maintain optimal conditions for fish
    (Vergina et al. 2020). Early warning systems: AI can be used to develop early
    warning systems that alert fish farmers to potential water quality issues before
    they escalate. By analyzing historical data patterns and correlations between
    water quality parameters and fish health, AI models can identify precursor signs
    that may lead to adverse conditions (Tung and Yaseen 2020). Early warnings enable
    proactive measures to be taken, such as adjusting water treatment, changing feeding
    strategies, or increasing aeration. Decision support systems: AI can be integrated
    into decision support systems that assist fish farmers in making informed decisions
    regarding water quality control. These systems can incorporate real-time data,
    historical records, and expert knowledge to provide recommendations on appropriate
    actions to optimize water quality parameters (Wu et al. 2021). AI algorithms can
    analyze the data and suggest specific interventions or adjustments to maintain
    the desired water quality conditions for fish. Adaptive control systems: AI-based
    adaptive control systems can automatically adjust environmental parameters based
    on real-time monitoring data. By utilizing machine learning techniques, these
    systems can learn the relationships between water quality parameters and fish
    responses (Deng et al. 2021). The control algorithms can then make dynamic adjustments
    to factors such as water temperature, oxygenation levels, or pH to maintain optimal
    conditions for fish growth and well-being. Predictive modeling: AI can be used
    to develop predictive models that forecast future water quality conditions based
    on historical data, environmental factors, and seasonal variations. By analyzing
    trends and patterns, AI models can predict potential fluctuations in water quality
    parameters, such as temperature changes or nutrient levels (Liao et al. 2021).
    Fish farmers can utilize these predictions to plan and implement preemptive measures
    to avoid adverse impacts on fish health. Optimization of water treatment processes:
    AI algorithms can optimize water treatment processes by analyzing large datasets
    and identifying the most effective treatment strategies. By considering factors
    such as water source characteristics, treatment methods, and desired water quality
    outcomes, AI can recommend optimal treatment processes to achieve the desired
    water quality conditions for fish (Abdallah et al. 2020). Data integration and
    analysis: AI techniques can integrate data from various sources, including sensor
    data, weather data, environmental data, and historical records, to gain a holistic
    understanding of water quality dynamics. By analyzing these diverse datasets,
    AI can identify correlations, trends, and patterns that may not be apparent through
    traditional analysis methods (Mondejar et al. 2021). This comprehensive analysis
    enhances the accuracy and effectiveness of water quality control strategies. These
    AI applications in water quality control for fish enable fish farmers to maintain
    optimal conditions for fish growth, minimize stress and mortality rates, and enhance
    overall productivity and sustainability in aquaculture operations. Environmental
    monitoring and modeling AI has several applications in environmental monitoring
    and modeling for fish populations. It can help gather, analyze, and interpret
    large amounts of data, enabling more accurate and timely decision-making. Here
    are some specific applications of AI in this context: Data collection and analysis:
    AI can automate data collection from various sources, such as satellite imagery,
    sensor networks, and environmental databases. It can process and analyze these
    data to monitor environmental parameters relevant to fish populations, such as
    water quality, temperature, salinity, and ocean currents (Kume et al. 2021). AI
    algorithms can identify patterns, anomalies, and trends in the data, providing
    valuable insights into the health and habitat conditions for fish. Species identification
    and tracking: AI techniques, such as computer vision and image recognition, can
    be used to identify and track fish species. By analyzing underwater images or
    video footage, AI algorithms can automatically detect and classify different species,
    including endangered or invasive species (Er et al. 2023). This information is
    crucial for monitoring population dynamics, assessing biodiversity, and understanding
    the ecological impact of different fish species. Habitat mapping and modeling:
    AI can assist in mapping and modeling fish habitats. By analyzing environmental
    data, including water depth, temperature, and substrate characteristics, AI algorithms
    can identify and predict suitable habitats for specific fish species. This information
    can aid in conservation efforts, restoration projects, and fisheries management
    by guiding decisions on habitat protection, enhancement, or restoration (Monteiro
    et al. 2021). Population modeling and forecasting: AI techniques, such as machine
    learning and statistical modeling, can be employed to develop population models
    for fish. By incorporating environmental variables, fishing pressure, and other
    relevant factors, these models can simulate and predict fish population dynamics
    over time (Senina et al. 2020). This information is valuable for assessing population
    sustainability, setting fishing quotas, and designing effective management strategies
    to ensure the long-term viability of fish populations. Disease detection and monitoring:
    AI algorithms can be used to detect and monitor diseases that affect fish populations.
    By analyzing physiological and behavioral data, such as changes in feeding patterns,
    swimming behavior, or skin coloration, AI can identify early signs of disease
    outbreaks (Gladju et al. 2022 and Fu et al. 2023). This enables prompt interventions,
    such as targeted treatment or quarantine measures, to mitigate the spread of diseases
    and minimize their impact on fish populations. Decision support systems: AI can
    be integrated into decision support systems for environmental management and fish
    population modeling. By combining real-time environmental data, historical records,
    and simulation models, AI-powered systems can provide recommendations for sustainable
    fisheries practices, habitat conservation, and ecosystem management (Polineni
    et al. 2022). These systems can aid policymakers, fishery managers, and conservationists
    in making informed decisions to protect fish populations and their habitats. The
    application of AI in environmental monitoring and modeling for fish offers valuable
    insights and tools to improve our understanding of fish populations, their habitats,
    and the broader ecosystems they inhabit. By leveraging AI technologies, we can
    enhance conservation efforts, optimize fisheries management, and promote sustainable
    practices in fishery and aquaculture industries. Benefits and limitations of AI
    in aquaculture AI offers several benefits in aquaculture, but it also has certain
    limitations. Let''s explore them: Benefits of AI in Aquaculture: Increased efficiency:
    AI technologies automate various tasks in aquaculture, such as monitoring water
    quality, feeding regimes, and disease detection. This automation reduces the need
    for manual labor and improves operational efficiency, enabling farmers to manage
    larger- scale operations with fewer resources (Panda and Baral 2023). Improved
    decision-making: AI algorithms can analyze complex datasets and provide insights
    for better decision-making. By processing data from sensors, satellites, and historical
    records, AI can optimize feeding schedules, water quality management, and other
    factors that impact fish health and growth (Gladju et al. 2022). This leads to
    more informed and effective decision-making in aquaculture operations. Early disease
    detection: AI can detect early signs of disease in fish by analyzing behavioral
    patterns, physiological data, and environmental conditions. Early detection enables
    timely intervention, minimizing the spread of diseases and reducing economic losses
    for fish farmers (Barreto et al. 2022). Precision aquaculture: AI technologies
    enable precision aquaculture by optimizing production processes based on real-time
    data. Through monitoring and analysis, AI can adjust feeding, oxygenation, and
    other variables to meet the specific needs of fish populations, resulting in improved
    growth rates, feed conversion efficiency, and resource utilization (Chiu et al.
    2022). Environmental sustainability: AI can contribute to sustainable aquaculture
    practices by optimizing resource usage and minimizing environmental impacts. By
    analyzing data on water quality, energy consumption, and waste management, AI
    algorithms can optimize operations to reduce the ecological footprint of aquaculture
    facilities (Alshater et al. 2023).  Limitations of AI in Aquaculture: Data availability
    and quality: The effectiveness of AI algorithms heavily depends on the availability
    and quality of data. In aquaculture, obtaining comprehensive and high-quality
    data can be challenging, especially in remote or offshore operations. Limited
    or inconsistent data can affect the accuracy and reliability of AI models (Aryai
    et al. 2021). Lack of domain-specific data: AI models require domain-specific
    data to be trained effectively. In some cases, aquaculture-specific datasets may
    be limited, making it difficult to develop robust and accurate AI models (Daniels
    et al. 2023). Collecting and labeling large- scale and diverse datasets for aquaculture
    applications can be time-consuming and resource- intensive. Model interpretability:
    Deep learning and complex AI models can often be seen as black boxes, making it
    challenging to interpret their decision-making process. In aquaculture, where
    decisions have significant implications for fish welfare and economic outcomes,
    interpretability is crucial for gaining trust and understanding the rationale
    behind AI-driven recommendations (Tsolakis et al. 2022). Cost and infrastructure
    requirements: Implementing AI technologies in aquaculture may involve upfront
    costs for sensors, data collection systems, computational resources, and skilled
    personnel. Small-scale fish farmers or those with limited resources may find it
    challenging to adopt AI due to the associated costs and infrastructure requirements
    (Mustapha et al. 2021). Ethical considerations: As with any technology, AI in
    aquaculture raises ethical considerations. For example, privacy concerns arise
    when collecting and storing sensitive data related to fish health, farming practices,
    or market intelligence. Ensuring proper data protection, informed consent, and
    ethical use of AI technologies are essential considerations in aquaculture applications
    (Dey and Shekhawat 2021). It''s important to note that while AI has immense potential
    in aquaculture, it should be seen as a tool that complements human expertise rather
    than replacing it entirely. A balance between AI-driven automation and human intervention
    is necessary to maximize the benefits and address the limitations of AI in aquaculture.
    Conclusion In conclusion, the role of AI in fish growth and health status monitoring
    is poised to revolutionize sustainable aquaculture practices. AI techniques offer
    significant potential for optimizing fish farming operations, improving productivity,
    and enhancing fish welfare while minimizing environmental impacts. By harnessing
    the power of machine learning, data analysis, and automation, AI enables real-time
    monitoring, early detection of diseases, precise feeding strategies, and proactive
    interventions to ensure optimal fish health and growth. AI- driven algorithms
    can analyze vast amounts of data from various sources, including environmental
    sensors, water quality measurements, fish behavior patterns, and genetic information.
    This data analysis enables the identification of key factors affecting fish growth,
    prediction of disease outbreaks, and the development of tailored strategies for
    optimized feeding, water quality management, and disease prevention. Moreover,
    AI technologies facilitate precise and targeted interventions, reducing resource
    wastage and minimizing the environmental footprint of aquaculture operations.
    Additionally, AI-driven autonomous systems and robotics hold promise for enhancing
    operational efficiency and reducing labor requirements in aquaculture. From underwater
    inspections and monitoring to automated feeding and sorting, AI-powered robots
    can streamline tasks, improve accuracy, and reduce human error. The future of
    AI in aquaculture lies in the integration of diverse data sources, interoperability
    of systems, and the development of decision support platforms. By integrating
    data from environmental monitoring, genetics, and market trends, AI can provide
    comprehensive insights and support informed decision-making. These advancements
    will foster sustainable aquaculture practices by optimizing resource utilization,
    mitigating environmental impacts, and promoting fish health and welfare. However,
    it is important to recognize that AI is a tool that should be combined with domain
    expertise and ethical considerations. Proper validation and calibration of AI
    models, data privacy, and maintaining human oversight are critical to ensure the
    responsible and effective use of AI in aquaculture. Overall, the role of AI in
    fish growth and health status monitoring is central to achieving sustainable aquaculture.
    By harnessing the power of AI technologies, we can pave the way for efficient,
    environmentally friendly, and economically viable fish farming practices that
    meet the increasing global demand for seafood while ensuring the well-being of
    fish populations and their ecosystems. Data availability Not applicable. References

  description: Estimation of root-zone soil moisture (SM) is crucial for effective
    agricultural management and water resource planning. However, current methods
    for soil moisture estimation exhibit several limitations that hinder their practical
    application. This study introduces a novel nowcasting model, which integrates
    in-situ and remote sensing data through a Predictive Error Compensated wavelet
    Neural NETwork (PECNET), addressing the drawbacks of existing approaches.Existing
    SM estimation techniques often suffer from limited accuracy, inadequate contextual
    information, and no real-time monitoring capabilities. Although remote sensing
    technologies offer promising advantages, such as wide spatial coverage and frequent
    data acquisition, they are not immune to limitations. Vegetation coverage and
    density present challenges in accurately estimating root-zone SM using remote
    sensing techniques. These factors can introduce uncertainties and errors in the
    estimation process, thereby impacting the reliability of the results.To overcome
    these limitations and enhance the accuracy of root-zone SM estimation, this study
    proposes the integration of remote sensing data with in-situ measurements. Specifically,
    Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculations from Landsat 7 and
    Landsat 8 satellites are fused with evapotranspiration and rainfall data obtained
    from agrometeorological stations. Combining these datasets generates an 8-day
    time series for the target parcels, leveraging the contextual information provided
    by NDVI and seasonality to improve the accuracy of root-zone soil moisture estimation.To
    develop a robust and efficient model, we introduce PECNET, which ensures the orthogonality
    of input features and facilitates the learning of non-linear relationships between
    variables. Notably, PECNET addresses the challenge of limited labeled training
    data, minimizing the risk of overfitting and enabling accurate estimation with
    fewer labeled samples. In addition, this study employs discrete wavelet transformation
    coefficients as inputs for the neural networks, demonstrating superior performance
    compared to direct measurements.Validation experiments were conducted to evaluate
    the performance of the proposed PECNET model. Comparative analyses with simple
    regression, Kriging, and feed-forward neural networks reveal the significant advantages
    of the Predictive Error Compensated wavelet Neural NETwork approach in root-zone
    soil moisture estimation.In conclusion, this research introduces an advanced nowcasting
    model for root-zone SM estimation. By integrating in-situ and remote sensing data,
    harnessing contextual information, and utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning
    techniques, our approach overcomes the limitations of existing methods. It offers
    a robust solution for accurate soil moisture estimation, with implications for
    precision agriculture, water management, and decision-making related to agricultural
    practices and land resource utilization. However, the limitations imposed by vegetation
    coverage and density on remote sensing technologies should be considered when
    interpreting the results.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Wuhan, China SECTION I. Introduction Root-zone
    soil moisture (SM) is crucial for agricultural water management, crop yield estimation,
    and drought monitoring [1]. For cereal crops, which primarily have their roots
    distributed at a 0-50 cm depth, soil moisture within these depths is often used
    to monitor and predict agricultural drought [2, 3]. However, measuring root-zone
    SM directly is challenging and costly, especially at large scales. Remote sensing
    data, such as microwave and optical imagery, can provide spatially and temporally
    consistent information on surface soil moisture and vegetation conditions related
    to root-zone SM. Various approaches and algorithms have been developed to estimate
    soil moisture using remote sensing data. Surface SM products of the SMOS (Soil
    Moisture and Ocean Salinity) mission by ESA (European Space Agency) and the SMAP
    (Soil Moisture Active Passive) mission by NASA are the primary products [4,5].
    Both missions use microwave sensors to measure SM, as microwave radiation is sensitive
    to the dielectric constant of water and can penetrate through clouds and vegetation.
    Another type of sensor that can be used for retrieving surface SM is optical/thermal
    infrared sensors [5]. Optical/thermal infrared sensors cannot measure the SM directly.
    Still, they can estimate it indirectly from other variables, such as land surface
    temperature (LST), vegetation indices, albedo, and net surface shortwave radiation
    (NSSR) [5, 6]. Surface SM data is used for estimating root-zone SM using complex
    physical models or data assimilation techniques [7, 8]. Machine learning techniques
    have been increasingly utilized for estimating root-zone SM, leveraging the relationships
    between near-surface observations and root-zone conditions [9, 10]. However, there
    are limitations due to the nature of soil moisture and machine learning algorithms.
    The surface and root-zone SM relationship can vary spatially and temporally, and
    it may be influenced by factors such as soil type, vegetation cover, and climatic
    conditions [7]. Machine learning models trained on specific environmental conditions
    may not generalize to different situations or regions. Models trained on one type
    of soil or vegetation may not perform as well in areas with different soil types
    or vegetation cover [7]. Also, inaccurate or limited ground truth data can affect
    the performance and reliability of the models [11]. In addition, overfitting is
    a common problem in machine learning, where a model performs well on the training
    data but fails to generalize to new data. In agricultural management, overfitting
    can occur when the model is trained on a small dataset that does not represent
    the entire population or when there are too many features compared to the number
    of observations [12]. The notion of orthogonality plays a pivotal role in the
    design and performance of machine learning models. Essentially, it refers to the
    independence and lack of correlation between various features or variables. We
    have developed an error-compensated neural network where the input parameters
    are discrete wavelet preprocessed as a solution to the ML drawbacks for a limited
    number of samples and an increasing number of input features [13]. In the context
    of PECNET, achieving higher orthogonality among input parameters for the final
    ANN ensures a reduced risk of overfitting. By promoting orthogonality, PECNET
    enhances its capacity to extract meaningful patterns from the data while disregarding
    irrelevant or redundant information. This, in turn, contributes to the model’s
    improved predictive accuracy and robustness when estimating root-zone SM dynamics.
    SECTION II. Materials and Methods A. The Setup and the Study Area Kirsehir, located
    in Turkey, is a province in Central Anatolia. The geographic coordinates of Kirsehir
    are approximately 39.1414°N latitude and 34.1673°E longitude. Kirsehir experiences
    a continental climate with distinct seasonal variations. Summers are generally
    hot and dry, while winters are cold and moderately snowy. The region receives
    limited rainfall, particularly during the summer months. The average annual precipitation
    in Kirşehir ranges from approximately 350 to 450 mm. However, it is important
    to note that precipitation patterns may vary yearly, and rainfall distribution
    throughout the seasons can influence agricultural practices. The region is known
    for cultivating various agricultural products. Wheat, barley, oats, and legumes
    are among the major cereal crops grown in Kirşehir. Our study focuses on data
    obtained from four selected parcels equipped with agrometeorological stations
    between September 2014 to July 2017, corresponding to three winter wheat cycles
    (Fig. 1). The dataset encompasses root-zone SM at a depth of 15cm (SM15) and 45cm
    (SM45), rainfall (RF) and 2m air temperature ( T a ) at a 10-minute resolution
    and evapotranspiration (ET0) at an hourly resolution. Complementing these in-situ
    measurements, we incorporate the NDVI, a key indicator of vegetation vigor and
    health, derived from Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 satellites. The synergy between data
    obtained from both satellites permits the creation of an 8-day dataset. In harmonizing
    the diverse temporal resolutions, we resample the in-situ measurements to match
    the satellite data’s 8-day intervals. This involves aligning the SM45 data with
    the satellite pass time (08:20 AM) and calculating the accumulated RF and ET0
    over the preceding eight days. By adopting the (ET0RF) metric, we holistically
    account for the interplay between water input and output, yielding a comprehensive
    water balance representation. Root-zone SM is quantified using tensiometric measurements,
    expressed in Centibars (cbar) of soil water tension. The root-zone SM values exhibit
    a dynamic range spanning 0 to 200 cbar, wherein 0-10 cbar signifies soil saturation
    and values exceeding 100 cbar indicate drier soil conditions. The interval between
    10 and 60 cbar represents the irrigation range, with variations for distinct soil
    types. We observe SM45 saturation (around 200 cbar) during certain months due
    to specific precipitation patterns. Fig. 1. Study Area and the selected parcels
    with agrometeorological stations Show All Our research acknowledges two prevalent
    scenarios in estimating root-zone SM for agricultural water management. In the
    first scenario, sensors are available at both reference and target stations. While
    training the model, in-situ measurements and satellite-derived NDVI are employed.
    During testing, the established model relationship is applied solely using satellite-derived
    NDVI. The second scenario arises when no sensor is accessible at the target point,
    necessitating a strategy that leans exclusively on satellite data for both training
    and testing. In scenarios where no sensors are accessible at the estimation station,
    the quest for improved accuracy necessitates a diversified dataset, often featuring
    spatial information, notably exemplified by the NDVI. However, moving beyond single-point
    measurements, our approach centers on harnessing the temporal patterns inherent
    in NDVI dynamics. These patterns encapsulate more valuable information than the
    mere cause behind NDVI fluctuations. For instance, an elevated NDVI might follow
    rainfall or emerge due to dew formation. Additionally, NDVI’s direct relevance
    to SM is limited. Instead, in our context, NDVI indirectly imparts data about
    the surface’s textural composition. Another data we used referring to the seasonality
    based on the sample’s corresponding day of the year (DOY) is given as equations
    1 and 2. Sin(D0Y)=Sin( DOY 365 ∗360) (1) View Source Cos(D0Y)=Cos( DOY 365 ∗360)
    (2) View Source B. Conventional Methods (Regression and Kriging) Linear regression
    is a statistical modeling technique where changes in the independent variables
    are associated with proportional changes in the dependent variable. It allows
    to identify and quantify the relationships between root-zone SM and independent
    variables, providing insights into the factors influencing root-zone SM dynamics.
    Our preliminary analysis shows that none of the examined parameters exhibit a
    substantial correlation with the target parameter, SM45 (Fig. 2). Notably, even
    the SM45 values across distinct parcels demonstrate varied correlation magnitudes,
    implying intricate non-linear associations. Also, a negative correlation was observed
    between NDVI and SM45, a phenomenon attributed to the distinctive characteristics
    of tensiometric measurement values. Kriging is a geostatistical interpolation
    technique commonly used in spatial analysis and prediction [13]. Kriging estimates
    values at unmeasured locations by considering the spatial correlation and variability
    of the observed data points. The main advantage of Kriging is its ability to provide
    optimal estimates, taking into account both the nearby measured values and the
    spatial structure of the data. It uses a weighted average of neighboring points,
    with weights determined by the spatial correlation between the points. Kriging
    accounts for the spatial autocorrelation of the data, making it particularly useful
    when the underlying process exhibits spatial trends or patterns. Despite its advantages,
    Kriging also has certain limitations and disadvantages. Kriging assumes stationarity,
    meaning that the statistical properties of soil moisture remain constant over
    the study area. However, SM can exhibit non-stationarity due to topography, soil
    types, and vegetation cover. C. Feed-forwardNeural Network Multi-Layer Perceptron
    (MLP) is a type of artificial neural network, a class of machine learning models
    inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. The MLP is a feed-forward
    neural network consisting of multiple layers of interconnected nodes called neurons.
    Each neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the subsequent layer,
    and each connection has an associated weight. In this study, we utilized an MLPRegressor
    for the case where the sensor is no longer present at the estimation point [14].
    So the relationship was established when there was a sensor at the point. MLPRegressor
    is a variant of MLP designed for regression tasks to model the relationship between
    multiple features and the target root-zone soil moisture. We preprocessed the
    data by splitting it into training (80%) and test (20%) sets and standardizing
    the features to ensure optimal model performance. The MLPRegressor was configured
    with two hidden layers and a learning rate of 0.01. Fig. 2. The correlation heatmap
    of the input variables and root-zone soil moisture at the selected parcels. Show
    All D. PECNET Model The PECNET model is utilized for cases with no sensor at the
    estimation points [15]. It presents a cascaded ANN architecture designed to enhance
    the prediction accuracy of chaotic and stochastic time series data (Fig. 3). In
    contrast to conventional approaches, PECNET operates on discrete wavelet coefficients
    extracted from input parameters, offering a more robust representation of the
    underlying temporal patterns. Since root-zone SM is an accumulated variable, direct
    measurements are replaced with parameter-specific wavelet coefficients. The initial
    stage of PECNET involves the deployment of ANNs, where discrete wavelet coefficients
    derived from the highest correlated input parameter with the target are inputted
    to the first ANN. The following ANN inputs are selected based on the highest correlation
    with the previous ANNs output. Concurrently, input parameters associated with
    seasonal variations are also fed into the ANNs. This cascaded stage is a vital
    component for pattern extraction and preliminary error estimation. The cascaded
    architecture computes and estimates errors and higher-order errors, progressively
    refining predictions. All the outputs of the cascaded ANNs culminate in a final
    ANN, which serves as the fusion network of the model. The inputs to the final
    ANN exhibit increased orthogonality, a property that safeguards against overfitting
    and enhances generalization capabilities. SECTION III. Results At first, we performed
    Kriging interpolation to examine if root-zone SM can be interpolated like other
    agrometeorological parameters such as air temperature ( T a ) . As the non-linearity
    increases, it gets harder to interpolate, and the spatial relationship weakens
    (Table 1). TABLE I Mean Absolute Error of Kriging Interpolation Fig. 3. PECNET
    training flowchart with an example where 40-12 station is the target. Show All
    Then simple linear regression is performed for the case where the estimation parcel
    has an agrometeorological sensor (Table 2). The results showed that using a linear
    model to estimate root-zone SM is impossible. Adding more variables to the model,
    including root-zone SM, also does not help to have improved results. As we added
    more variables, the p-values of the independent variables got worse by getting
    higher than 0.05 in most cases for the coefficients of independent variables.
    Yet, using only (E T 0− RF) and NDVI as the independent variables made it worse
    based on the R2 and mean absolute error (MAE) values. It is shown that there is
    a need for reference stations to estimate root-zone SM accurately. If the land
    cover, in this situation, the type of cultivation, is known together with adequate
    context information about surrounding points, it is possible to establish the
    relationship. A feed-forward neural network with MLPRegressor is utilized to examine
    the estimation performance where SM45, NDVI, and (E T 0− RF) are used as input
    parameters (Table 3). We employed the R2 Score and MAE for performance evaluation
    to assess the model’s accuracy and generalization ability. It is observed that
    even using SM45 alone as the input parameter, the MLPRegressor overfits. Adding
    new parameters, hence increasing the number of input features, also resulted in
    low training MAE but high test MAE values indicating the overfitting of the model.
    The MLPRegressor was shown to be not adequate for learning the non-linear relationship
    of root-zone SM. Even with a sensor at the estimation point in the training phase,
    the MLPRegressor is overfitted. So when there is a need to increase the number
    of inputs in the case of no sensor at the estimation point, there is a need to
    summarize all the input features and overcome the overfitting problem. Hence the
    PECNET model is utilized for this second case. The results demonstrated that the
    PECNET model effectively captured the underlying patterns in the data and achieved
    high accuracy in predicting the target variable (Table IV). Also, it is shown
    that adding the seasonality context helps to achieve better estimation performance.
    The presented evaluation metric results provide comprehensive insights into the
    model’s performance and ability to generalize to unseen data. SECTION IV. Conclusion
    In this study, we have introduced a pioneering nowcasting model, Predictive Error
    Compensated wavelet Neural NETwork (PECNET), to revolutionize accurate root-zone
    SM estimation. The significance of precise SM estimation in agricultural management
    and water resource planning cannot be understated. By integrating in-situ and
    remote sensing data, incorporating contextual information, and harnessing advanced
    machine learning techniques, our approach addresses the limitations of existing
    methods, marking a significant advancement in this field. Existing methods for
    SM estimation often grapple with inherent inaccuracies, lack of comprehensive
    context, and real-time monitoring limitations. The integration of remote sensing
    data, while promising, faces obstacles such as vegetation coverage complexities.
    Our solution bridges these gaps by combining the power of remote sensing data
    with in-situ measurements. This integration, driven by NDVI data from Landsat
    7 and Landsat 8 satellites, alongside agrometeorological data, results in an 8-day
    time series dataset that captures crucial contextual nuances. PECNET presents
    a comprehensive solution to address the challenges associated with cumulative
    variables and complex temporal patterns by harnessing the power of discrete wavelet
    coefficients and exploiting the advantages of orthogonality. The multi-stage architecture
    and the emphasis on orthogonality underscore PECNET’s potential as an effective
    tool for soil moisture prediction in various environmental contexts. TABLE II

    illustrate the potential of PECNET as a powerful tool for modeling non-linear
    relationships in diverse domains, making it a valuable addition to the repertoire
    of machine learning techniques for various real-world applications. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

  description: Currently the oil and gas industry is becoming more digitalized. The
    abundance of data varieties that are recorded has driven the industry to move
    forward from the conventional data management to more fashioned data acquisition.
    The field under study (Field A) is a deep-water gas asset, characterized by a

    and facies modelling, trying to embed dynamic evidence. Among parameters taken

    layers and possible additional explorative targets. The result of this screening
    led to the strategic business decision to plan an infilling well, with primary
    target the best unexploited sub-portion identified inside one of the analyzed

    impacting on the core business. The automation of data extraction, will lead the

    Published: June 05 2023 Cite Share Get Permissions Abstract Currently the oil
    and gas industry is becoming more digitalized. The abundance of data varieties
    that are recorded has driven the industry to move forward from the conventional
    data management to more fashioned data acquisition. The field under study (Field
    A) is a deep-water gas asset, characterized by a complex internal architecture
    of many separate and discrete gas charged stacked sand bodies. Objective of this
    paper is to show the key role of the reservoir monitoring strategy, fully integrated
    in a multidisciplinary workflow that allowed to detail the reservoir conceptual
    model leading to the identification of valuable production optimization opportunities.
    Field A produces through smart wells with selective completions, equipped with
    permanent down hole gauge (one for each open layer) allowing Real Time Monitoring
    of the key dynamic parameters (e.g., rate, flowing bottom hole pressure) and implementation
    of surveillance actions such as selective Pressure Transient Analysis. A workflow
    is implemented to be able to describe each open layer performance integrating
    all available data starting from well back allocation verification through virtual
    metering implementation. Then, Inflow Performance Relationship per layer is used
    to back-allocate well production to each unit. Robust continuous update of material
    balance analysis for each layer allowed to verify alignment between the geological
    gas volume in place and the dynamic connected volume, leading to update coherently
    also the dynamic model. Comparison between geological gas volume in place and
    dynamic connected one triggered a revision of geological modelling, reviewing
    seismic uncertainty and facies modelling, trying to embed dynamic evidence. Among
    parameters taken in account, layers internal connectivity resulted as the most
    impacting one. The revised model allowed to identify and rank residual opportunities
    on developed layers and possible additional explorative targets. The result of
    this screening led to the strategic business decision to plan an infilling well,
    with primary target the best unexploited sub-portion identified inside one of
    the analyzed layers together with other stacked minor targets. The expectation
    of primary target resulted confirmed by the data acquired in the new well drilled.
    Moreover, the real time monitoring workflow has been implemented in a digital
    environment for continuous automated update resulting in continuous reservoir
    monitoring and management. The successful experience on Field A proved the key
    role of a structured Reservoir Monitoring strategy as \"drive mechanism\" for
    a decision-making process extremely impacting on the core business. The automation
    of data extraction, will lead the way to an increasingly efficient use of \"big

  description: In order to monitor water resource projects, this study examines the
    use of Statistical Process Control (SPC) charts in the context of dam projects.
    A survey of the body of knowledge on the subject of water resource project monitoring
    methods is the first stage in the research project. In this research, we'll focus
    on the advantages of use SPC charts to achieve that objective. Water resource
    projects are crucial pieces of infrastructure, and as such, they need constant
    supervision to ensure that they continue to operate properly and efficiently.
    SPC, or statistical process control, is a technique used for quality control and
    process monitoring across a wide range of industries. On the other hand, traditional
    SPC methodologies might not be suitable for real-time monitoring of water resource
    projects due to the complexity and unpredictability of water systems. Artificial
    intelligence (AI)-based methods have lately gained attention as a potential solution
    to these issues. In this paper, we provide an artificial intelligence-based SPC
    framework for real-time monitoring and quality control of projects involving water
    resources using a case study of a dam building project. The framework that has
    been proposed combines SPC with machine learning techniques to automatically detect
    anomalies and predict how the system will behave in the future. The results show
    that the artificial intelligence-based SPC framework outperforms the traditional
    SPC techniques in terms of timeliness, accuracy, and efficiency. The framework
    has the potential to improve the management and long-term profitability of water
    resource projects, which would ultimately aid in preserving the environment and
    the general public's health.

  description: This paper reports on major outcomes of the ERA-PLANET (The European
    network for observing our changing planet) project, which was funded under Horizon
    2020 ERA-net co-funding scheme. ERA-PLANET strengthened the European Research
    Area in the domain of Earth Observation (EO) in coherence with the European participation
    to Group on Earth Observation and the Copernicus European Union's Earth Observation
    programme. ERA-PLANET was implemented through four projects focused on smart cities
    and resilient societies (SMURBS), resource efficiency and environmental management
    (GEOEssential), global changes and environmental treaties (iGOSP) and polar areas
    and natural resources (iCUPE). These projects developed specific science-policy
    workflows and interfaces to address selected environmental policy issues and design
    cost-effective strategies aiming to achieve targeted objectives. Key Enabling
    Technologies were implemented to enhancing ‘data to knowledge’ transition for
    supporting environmental policy making. Data cube technologies, the Virtual Earth
    Laboratory, Earth Observation ontologies and Knowledge Platforms were developed
    and used for such applications. SMURBS brought a substantial contribution to resilient
    cities and human settlements topics that were adopted by GEO as its 4th engagement
    priority, bringing the urban resilience topic in the GEO agenda on par with climate
    change, sustainable development and disaster risk reduction linked to environmental
    policies. GEOEssential is contributing to the development of Essential Variables
    (EVs) concept, which is encouraging and should allow the EO community to complete
    the description of the Earth System with EVs in a close future. This will clearly
    improve our capacity to address intertwined environmental and development policies
    as a Nexus. iGOSP supports the implementation of the GEO Flagship on Mercury (GOS4M)
    and the GEO Initiative on POPs (GOS4POPs) by developing a new integrated approach
    for global real-time monitoring of environmental quality with respect to air,
    water and human matrices contamination by toxic substances, like mercury and persistent
    organic pollutants. iGOSP developed end-user-oriented Knowledge Hubs that provide
    data repository systems integrated with data management consoles and knowledge
    information systems. The main outcomes from iCUPE are the novel and comprehensive
    data sets and a modelling activity that contributed to delivering science-based
    insights for the Arctic region. Applications enable defining and monitoring of
    Arctic Essential Variables and sets up processes towards UN2030 SDGs that include
    health (SDG 3), clean water resources and sanitation (SDGs 6 and 14).

    interface is a critical factor in environmental governance as exchange of information,
    construction of knowledge and enriching of decision-making are far from being
    transferred between scientists and actors in the policy making process (van den
    Hove, 2007). Robust and evidence-based information for policy-makers is more often
    demanded (The European Commission, 2022d). Hence, the main question is of how
    research findings can be translated into knowledge for policy (Fazey et al., 2013)
    and consequently transferred (Rosli, 2015, Porter et al., 2019). Effective interactions
    have sometime triggered initiatives when for example International Conventions
    were prepared, adopted, signed and ratified (see the United Nations Glossary of
    terms relating to Treaty actions (UN, 2020), but in most cases siloed behaviours
    are observed (Ozga, 2011, Young et al., 2014). Science findings are also underutilized
    in environmental policy design (Jensen-Ryan and German, 2018) and current obstacles
    to their integration include: the inability to frame information (Jacobs and Pulwarty,
    2003); poor scientific result translation and access to findings (Ascher et al.,
    2010, Driscoll et al., 2011); low mutual engagement and high conceptual separation
    (Janse, 2008); and in the recent times growing of anti-science and fake news (Scheufele
    and Krause, 2019), as well documented. To overcame such obstacles, all involved
    actors that include knowledge generators, synthesizers, aggregator, brokers, decision-
    and policy-makers (Gluckman, 2016, Gluckman, 2018) must be involved in the process
    and can effectively close the gap and make science results prompt to answer policy
    concern on the environmental governance. Moreover, the information science it
    produces and exchanges, need to be credible, relevant and legitimate (Sarkki et
    al., 2013). In our fast-changing environment policy is asked to replay with timely
    decisions, which should be based on evident scientific results, jointly planned,
    and effectively implemented (Plummer et al., 2010). Policy-makers are typically
    concerned about general public priorities which in last years posed their attention
    on the environment and governance of decision-making processes. For example, in
    the European context, in 2020 new priorities were established to cope with the
    growing “green” demand, which can have a deep impact on the European innovation
    strategy (e.g., European Green Deal) (Sikora, 2021) as reflected, for example,
    in the European Data Strategy (The European Commission, 2022c,a). Similarly, the
    Horizon Europe, the EU’s key Framework Programme on Research and Innovation tackles
    competitiveness and growth having in mind the United Nation’s (UN) Sustainable
    Development Goals (The European Commission, 2022b). At the same time, major inter-governmental
    bodies are deeply involved to close the science-policy loop, bringing scientific
    results to the public and specifically to policy-makers. For example, the intergovernmental
    Group on Earth Observations (GEO) is “working to improve the availability, access
    and use of open Earth observations, including satellite imagery, remote sensing
    and in situ data, to impact policy and decision making in a wide range of sectors”
    (GEO, 2022). And the United Nation (UN) through its environment programme is fostering
    the coordination among different actors in the global political context (UNEP,
    2018). In the above scenario, the ERA-PLANET (The European network for observing
    our changing planet) project (http://www.era-planet.eu) started its activities
    in February 2016 with the objective of strengthening the European Research Area
    in the domain of Earth Observation (EO) in coherence with the European participation
    to GEO and the Copernicus as European Union’s EO programmes. Four transnational
    projects were launched through ERA-PLANET with the objective of providing more
    accurate, comprehensive and authoritative information to policy and decision-makers
    in key societal benefit areas that were: i) smart cities and resilient societies
    (SMURBS) (http://smurbs.eu); ii) resource efficiency and environmental management
    (GEOEssential) (http://geoessential.eu); iii) global changes and environmental
    treaties (iGOSP) (http://igosp.eu); and iv) polar areas and natural resources
    (iCUPE) (http://www.atm.helsinki.fi/icupe/). After 4-years of activity (Sep-2017
    to Aug-2021) the four projects have exploited and demonstrated the opportunity
    to use EO data and products for actionable decision-making (Hanan et al., 2020)
    to fulfil EU’s strategic goals in all selected domains (e.g., International Conventions,
    Urban Environment, Polar Environment). The Data Sharing and Data Management Principles
    established in GEO were adopted with the main objective of making data accessible
    and improve the process of knowledge creation to ensure its reproducibility and
    connection to scientific evidence (Mazzetti et al., 2022). This paper aims at
    describing the overall conceptual policy-driven workflow followed in the four
    projects by highlighting applications that were developed to address and analyse
    selected socio-environmental-policy scenarios. ERA-PLANET Key Enabling Technologies
    (KETs) (e.g.: Virtual Earth Laboratory (VLab), EO ontologies and Knowledge Hub
    platforms) are also described as tools to support the EO information lifecycle
    from the acquisition of observation to the generation of knowledge feeding environmental
    decision-making processes. 2. Project contributions to policy-driven workflow
    Recent progress in digital information technologies and development of high-resolution
    sensors and tools are generating new challenges for scientists and policy-makers
    (Galindo-Rueda, 2020), as well as are creating new opportunities for using EO
    data and tools, especially in the context of big data, open science and artificial
    intelligence. They are expected to provide a major contribution to link key environmental,
    societal and policy issues for better understanding the growing global concern
    on sustainable development and ecological transition patterns. ERA-PLANET devised
    a conceptual framework for Earth Science informed decision-making in support of
    environmental policies. The framework lays on relevant policy questions or political
    agendas that drive trusted data collection, scenario development and production
    of user-friendly applications (Figure 1). In such a framework, EO and socio-economic
    data provide the facts describing the relevant status of affairs, while Earth
    Science and environmental computational models encode the scientific theories
    to elicit the relevant knowledge about the past, present and future of the observed
    system in form of indicators and indices useful for policy-relevant decision-making
    (Mazzetti et al., 2022). The four transnational projects applied this conceptual
    framework by developing applications for different policy domains. In the following
    section, background, specific workflow and developed applications are described
    for each project. Download : Download high-res image (97KB) Download : Download

    for developing EO-based applications for actionable decision-making. 2.1. SMURBS:
    Smart URBan solutions for air quality, disasters and city growth Background. In
    the urban domain, both European and international policies have demonstrated the
    urgency for sustainable urbanization and development, in which all means are necessary
    to achieve objectives in a holistic manner. The smart city concept is one of these
    means, which has also been considered a key component of the Shaping Europe’s
    digital future Policy (The European Commission, 2013) in the EU 2014–2020 Programming
    Period, while it also permeates into other EU policies, as for example the regional
    policy’s Urban Development (The European Commission, 2020). In parallel, the 2030
    UN Agenda for Sustainable Development has been adopted by UN-Habitat III, which
    has included the city-oriented Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11: \"Make cities
    and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable\", and has set
    the New Urban Agenda as the global framework to localize actions through improved
    access to science, technology and innovation. Lastly, through Europe’s new growth
    strategy - the European Green Deal (The European Commission, 2021b) – the transformation
    into a fair and prosperous society -where EU’s natural capital is enhanced and
    citizen’s well-being is promoted will be pursued, the important impacts on cities
    and the opportunities arising from and within cities have been highlighted, and
    the acceleration of a sustainable transition of cities and towns will be followed
    (The European Commission, 2021a). Workflow. SMURBS’a team, during the initial
    stage of its implementation, made a thorough analysis of the legal and policy
    framework under the three themes it has been addressing, starting from the international
    level – passing on to the European Union level and ending with the national and
    local level, for the latter drawing mainly information from its pilot cities (SMURBS,
    2018). Follow the main findings, which also have set the stage for the design
    and implementation of the project’s solutions. In the air quality domain, where
    the European Commission (EC) has been proactive in defining a comprehensive strategy
    and an implementation methodology, the Framework Directive, as well as its Daughter
    Directives requires the assessment of the ambient air quality existing in Member
    States based on common methods and criteria. The penetration of the EU legal framework
    into the national/regional/local frameworks has been considered high, while the
    competences of implementation and evaluation have been collocated at regional
    and local levels. The legal obligations of the air quality regulatory networks
    have been established with respect to the exceedances of specific legal limits.
    In the urban growth domain, the relevant legislation exploration has shown several
    strengths relating to the coverage of soil threats and functions by existing EU
    laws. The two international Agendas, the Urban Agenda for the EU (EU – UA) and
    the New Urban Agenda (UN – NUA), share the same vision for a balanced, sustainable
    and integrated urban development. However, since they do not include specific
    indicators or indices and lack of executive instruments, this might make them
    less effective for the adoption of sustainable policies, at least at the first
    stages of implementation. It has been generally deduced that there is no EU level
    political or legislative driver for establishing integration and coherence towards
    an agreed strategic aim and objectives, while concentrating on the national/regional
    local level, it seems that the lack of strategic coordination is an important
    obstacle. Finally, in the disaster domain, the relevant international legal reference
    is laid down by the Sendai framework that contains a set of common standards,
    achievable targets, and a legally-based instrument for disaster risk reduction.
    This disaster framework has been translated into a disaster risk–informed approach
    for all EU policies. The penetration of the UN Sendai framework and the European-to-National
    law has been found to reach a good level, while gaps in legal obligations are
    related to spatial planning, the lack of regular coordination between disaster
    management service and research institutions that can provide high-end products
    and comprehensive solutions for decision makers. The SMURBS project gathers several
    solutions for creating bottom-up EO-driven solutions (SMURBS, 2020) against modern
    environmental urban pressures. The project has set up a real-world laboratory
    to test and evaluate how easily and efficiently EO can be used to address urban
    issues, focusing on air pollution (including health implications), natural and
    manmade disasters and urban growth (including migration aspects). The main outcome
    of the project has been the development of a portfolio of solutions, adopting
    a process where engagement with the users to match needs and gaps and co-design
    products and services has been central (Georgiadis et al., 2022, Gerasopoulos
    et al., 2022). Applications. SMURBS portfolio of Smart Urban Solutions attempted
    to provide answers to relevant policy questions and suggest possible solutions
    based on current legal framework. Along this line, indicative solution types,
    policy and smart aspects for air quality (Table 1), urban growth (Table 2) and

    2) and provide feedback on the Initiative’s compilation of use cases and good
    practices. Along the same line and through iterations within all four strands
    of ERA-PLANET, the project has arrived at a set of Essential Urban Variables (EUVs)
    that, in line with the established process, aims to proposing them for consideration
    to the EO community for further discussion. Download : Download high-res image

    platform on SDG 11.6.2 indicator covering Europe. 2.2. GEOEssential: Essential
    Variables workflows for resource efficiency and environmental management Background.
    The international environmental policy agenda on climate, biodiversity, energy,
    water, and more widely SDGs is percolating quickly into European and National
    agendas. While policy makers are requesting new accurate spatial-temporal indicators
    to assess their progress towards policy objectives at various scales, science
    is struggling to bring the necessary data and tools on the table in a timely manner.
    However, significant progress has been made in EO to gather a variety of environmental
    observations from both space-based platforms and in-situ observatories. The key
    question is where these data sets are? What is the degree of their utilization
    by end users? In most cases, these data sets are very difficult to find. It can
    be frustrating to see the gap expanding between our capacity to monitor our planet
    and its urgent environmental challenges, and the few examples where this knowledge
    is truly being used to improve decision making. While time is passing by, opportunities
    to reverse the general unsustainable trend are shrinking. The question becomes
    therefore, how we can improve the access to scientific knowledge on the functioning
    of our socio-ecological systems based on our increased capacities to observe temporal
    variations of key parameters on the functioning of our planet. Workflow. To tackle
    the above issues GEOEssential adopted two main strategies. First, GEOEssential
    proposed to improve and generalize the concept of Essential Variables across all
    spheres of the Earth System (Atmo-, Bio-, Hydro-, and Geo-), as well as key domains
    of human activities such as Agriculture, Energy, Transport and infrastructure,
    Urban development and Health (Lehmann et al., 2022). Essential Variables are indeed
    classes of EO data that fit in between available EO and selected policy indicators.
    It is becoming indeed essential to clearly define what needs to be monitored through
    time and space in order to evaluate the selected policy indicators, as well as
    cost-effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. Second, GEOEssential developed
    functional workflows from data sources to indicators with sets of identified Essential
    Variables. These workflows are addressing different environmental policies at
    various scales as a demonstration that if they can be developed for one policy
    context, they could be generalized to most of them, and therefore lower the barriers
    for accessing state of the art scientific knowledge for policy making (Lehmann
    et al., 2022). Application. Most applications and workflows developed in GEOEssential
    are related to the SDG indicators, however the approach can be generalized to
    other global environmental policies, as well as regional, national and even local
    ones (Lehmann et al., 2020). The idea of better defining what is essential to
    be monitored in order to inform policy indicators and/or fully define a system
    is crucial to build sustainable information systems and to identify potential
    gaps in the information workflows. By promoting the development of Essential Variables
    across all domains of activity of GEO, the GEOEssential project is starting to
    have an impact on the most important observation systems and their communities.
    We show how Essential Variables are rapidly spreading into the description of
    the natural Earth System (atmosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere and biosphere) (Lehmann
    et al., 2022), while the work is starting on the description of the socio-economic
    spheres of human activities in Agriculture, Health, Energy, Infrastructure and
    Transport as well as Urban. It appears now evident to more and more experts that
    we need to have quick access to quality data in many different domains to address
    complex issues such as those raised by our sustainability quest. All four priority
    policies of GEO (SDGs, Sendai framework on natural risks, Climate Change and Urban
    Development) necessitate the access and integration of data across scientific
    domains. Indeed, most of the present environmental crises could be mitigated by
    reducing the pressure of human activities by implementing more efficient and less
    energy demanding technologies in the industrial sectors. The development of Essential
    Variables across all GEO domains creates a pyramid of information that needs to
    be clearly embedded in information and knowledge systems. Therefore, the GEOEssential
    project has been working on defining a knowledge-based platform linking policy
    indicators with Essential Variables (Figure 3), and a geoprocessing data platform
    to implement dedicated workflows for data processing and analysis (Mazzetti et
    al., 2022). Download : Download high-res image (660KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. Web application which utilizes the VLab enhanced in the GEOEssential
    project to run the EODESM model ((Lucas and Mitchell, 2017)) for calculating land
    cover and land cover changes in a set of protected areas; the depicted output
    shows the result of the computation over the Gran Paradiso protected area in Italy.
    The showcase is built through a collaboration of ERA-PLANET and other institutions
    and projects. Within the scope of the project, GEOEssential has developed for
    instance the following workflows on SDGs: • SDG 2.4.1 - The “productive agricultural
    land” workflow is targeting policy and decision-makers whose work may affect or
    may be affected by land productivity, biodiversity or nature’s contributions to
    people at all levels (local, national and global), as well as the United Nations
    entities and multilateral environmental agreements. This workflow has been developed
    across Ukraine. • SDG 6.4.2 - The “levels of water stress” workflow quantifies
    a decade (2011–2020) of monthly (agricultural) water stress levels across Europe
    using satellite-derived Evapotranspiration (ET) data and Evaporative Stress Index
    (ESI) anomalies at 4 km spatial resolution. • SDG 11.3.1 - The “Land consumption”
    workflow estimates land consumption rate based on land cover classification for
    urban areas, on the basis of which it is possible to estimate built-up area for
    large territory of interest and even for the whole country of Ukraine at 10 m
    resolution. • SDG 15.1.1 - The “forest area as a proportion of total land area”
    workflows is calculating for any region of the world the trend in the proportion
    of forest and agricultural areas. • SDG 15.3.1 - The “land degradation” workflow
    is using the Trends.Earth model published in the GEOEssential Virtual Laboratory
    (VLab) in order to assess the area degraded, using information from sub- indicators:
    Land cover, Land productivity and Carbon stocks. While developing these workflows
    based on Essential Variables, GEOEssential also contributed to improving and creating
    new web user interfaces such as UNEP/MapX (http://www.mapx.org) and the Radiance
    Light Trends application (http://lighttrends.lightpollutionmap.info). 2.3. iGOSP:
    Integrated Global Observing Systems for persistent pollutants Background. The
    international policy context is showing that there is a high interest to gain
    additional insights into the cycling of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) regulated
    under the Stockholm Convention and mercury (Hg) regulated under the Minamata Convention
    on Mercury. The integration of EO and in-situ data into various atmospheric, ocean
    and terrestrial models can give information on the relative contributions of different
    chemical and physical processes involved in the cycling of these pollutants between
    environmental compartments. This action aims to lay down the foundation on a possible
    extension of the usage of already available satellite data to further improve
    our understanding on the environmental cycling of the aforementioned substances.
    iGOSP is contributing to the development of a Knowledge Hub in support of the
    Minamata Convention on Mercury (MCM) and a Global Monitoring Plan Data Warehouse
    (GMP-DWH) of the Stockholm Convention. These activities are taking place in the
    framework of the GEO Flagship on Mercury (GOS4M) and the GEO Initiative on POPs
    (GOS4POPs). Workflow. iGOSP has developed the following workflow integrated in
    an interoperable Knowledge Hub (GOS4M-KH): • Interaction with policy-makers to
    define relevant policy questions. • Design of up-stream and down-stream tools/applications
    for data analytics and trend analysis. • Co-design (with policy makers and stakeholders)
    of policy-driven emission reduction scenarios that would be used to run a set
    of multimedia models1 to derive the relationship between mercury releases to air
    and water and mercury bioaccumulation in marine biota. • Definition of a set of
    cost-effective strategies of emission reductions that would allow nations to achieve
    the objectives of the MCM in reducing the risk for human health and ecosystems.
    • Design of the Graphical User Interface to facilitate the use of the GOS4M-KH.
    As outcome of policy-driven meetings a number of key policy relevant questions
    were considered as basis for developing the science-policy interface such as (to
    mention a few among the most relevant): • What is the relative contribution of
    each anthropogenic emission source to the global mercury budget? • What are the
    possible cost-effective emission reduction scenarios for major anthropogenic emission
    sources? • For selected emission reduction scenarios what would be the time necessary
    to observe a significant reduction of mercury bioaccumulated in biological end
    points such as fish and marine mammals? • What is the relative contribution of
    anthropogenic emission regions to mercury deposition in another region (export/import
    ratio)? The design of tools and applications was based on the above policy-relevant
    questions for contributing to the on-going work at global level to shape a standard
    methodology for assessing the effectiveness of policy measures undertaken by nations
    to reduce the risk associated to mercury exposure. A second challenge for iGOSP
    was to contribute to the GEO initiative GOS4POPs (Global Observation System for
    Persistent Organic Pollutants, POPs) by developing a new integrated approach for
    global real-time monitoring of environmental quality with respect to air, water
    and human matrices contamination by toxic substances. The outputs are designed
    to serve nations that ratified the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic
    Pollutants and represent a key pillar for evaluating the effectiveness of established
    global measures to mitigate POPs releases and protect human health and the environment
    from the exposure to POPs. For that the iGOSP developed a fully integrated system
    of advanced monitoring sensors and established a complex and fully harmonized
    knowledge hub. The POPs Knowledge Hub is a data repository with data management
    console and knowledge information system complemented by visualization platform
    created within iGOSP. The workflow supporting global POPs management as part of
    the GOS4POPs Initiative includes the following components: • Interaction with
    policy-makers and experts for finalizing parameters and harmonization needs. •
    Design of tools/parameters to involve all relevant data producers. • Implementation
    of technologies and standards to provide data management tools. • Design of new
    technologies enabling sharing outputs with end-users. • Design of the Graphical
    User Interface. With the POPs Knowledge Hub (GMP–DWH), the iGOSP increased the
    availability of real-time data to policy-makers to make better decisions and design
    more effective policies in the area of regulating persistent pollutants and minimizing
    the risk associated to POPs exposure. Application for the Minamata Convention.
    The growing perception of nations on the strategic importance of using EO datasets
    to better characterize the magnitude and spatial distributions of Hg pollution
    led to the creation of the GEO Flagship on Hg (GOS4M, http://www.gos4m.org) (as
    part of the GEO WP 2016–2025). GOS4M was designed to support policy makers by
    enhancing EO data sharing, fostering the design and development of integrated
    modelling tools to allow decision makers to evaluate the linkages between causes
    and effects of Hg pollution and elaborate possible cost-effective strategies that
    nations may implement to achieve the objectives of the MCM. The main goal of the
    GOS4M Flagship was the development of an operational Knowledge Hub that all interested
    parties (i.e., nations, stakeholders, policy makers) may use for characterizing
    the linkages between impacts and effect of mercury contamination on Earth system
    and human health at different geographical and temporal scales. The multimedia
    and multi-domain computational system was designed to evaluate the potential effectiveness
    of measures that nations may undertake to reduce the impact of mercury contamination
    on human health and ecosystems for selected policy scenarios. The first level
    macro-indicator is the Hg bioaccumulation in biological endpoints, which can be
    Hg in fish at upper trophic levels (level 3 or 4) while the second level is the
    Hg concentration in ambient air and precipitation samples. Long-term trends of
    macro-indicators can be analysed to assess the effectiveness of measures on medium-long
    term basis and eventually estimate associated socio-economic costs. In addition,
    the GOS4M through iGOSP is contributing to the UNEP Global Mercury Fate and Transport
    Partnership (UNEP F&T) which was launched in 2006, with the objective to provide
    state of the art knowledge on different aspects related to mercury releases to
    the atmosphere, its long-range atmospheric transport and deposition patterns to
    aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and its potential impact on human health and
    ecosystems. Having in mind relevant policy questions a set of reduction scenarios
    were defined (De Simone et al., 2020), which were based on 2010 inventories (AMAP/UNEnvironment,
    2013) that grouped anthropogenic mercury emissions in well characterised industrial
    macro–sectors. The policy-driven scenarios were simulated by means of a Chemical
    Transport Model (CTM), namely ECHMERIT (Jung et al., 2009, De Simone et al., 2014).
    The scope of the simulation was to assess the impact of the emission reduction
    on the global mercury deposition. Main results highlight that an action on a single
    industrial sector does not provide significant deposition reduction over any receptor
    region. While a reduction of emissions on all sectors has an impact on different
    receptors at different levels. To make accessible all developed scenarios and
    provide a user-friendly tool for analysis, some widgets were developed (Figure
    4). The analysis tool is based on a statistical emulator that help the scenario
    assessment (De Simone et al., 2021). The application developed through specific
    widgets interacts with a biogeochemical model to provide long-term changes of
    the mercury burden in the oceans. The end-point of the application is a trophic
    model that gives information on mercury uptake by marine biota. The running application
    that implements the iGOSP workflow can be explored at http://www.gos4m.org/kh.

    and uptake by marine biota. The emission map (A) based on 2015 inventories (AMAP/UN
    Environment, 2019) can give amount of emission by country and sector; the data
    catalog browser (B) can guide to data discovery and download; the Chemical–Transport
    model emulator (C) can give information on deposition reduction over land and
    oceans (D1), trends of Hg burden in the ocean (D2) and the Hg uptake by marine
    biota (D3). Moreover, an optimisation framework was developed to extend the capabilities
    of the emulator (De Simone et al., 2022). It gives the possibility to define a
    deposition reduction target in one or more regions and obtain the optimal set
    of emissions reductions in different industrial macro-sectors by considering all
    the geographical source regions. Application for the Stockholm Convention. The
    overarching goal of the GOS4POPs (Global Observing System for Persistent Organic
    Pollutants) Initiative is to further develop the Global Monitoring Plan (GMP)
    for POPs by harmonizing standard operating procedures for monitoring these substances
    in core environmental and human matrices and support the sharing of standardized
    data (Hůlek et al., 2020). GOS4POPs initiative has a clear policy mandate from
    the Stockholm Convention on POPs. Article 16 of the Stockholm Convention requires
    periodic assessment and evaluation of the effectiveness of measures adopted by
    the Convention to eliminate or significantly reduce POPs releases into the environment.
    To this regard, the GMP was established to collect comparable, harmonized and
    reliable information on POP levels in core environmental matrices (air, human
    tissues (breast milk/blood), and water). The GOS4POPs Initiative should further
    improve and strengthen the GMP by including newly listed POPs and core media into
    existing and newly developed monitoring networks, by extension of the GMP Data
    Warehouse, and by allowing for more efficient data sharing and access to historical
    and newly collected data sets. A specific consideration was given to the necessity
    to ensure internal consistency of data within programmes; and at the same time,
    to strive for comparability of data among programmes so that data sets can be
    combined (Melymuk et al., 2021). The POPs part of the iGOSP project was designed
    to deal with: • enhanced monitoring of newly listed POPs in core matrices through
    their implementation into existing monitoring programmes, • improved spatial coverage,
    quality, comparability and accessibility of data from existing (atmospheric, water,
    human) (bio)monitoring networks, • establishment of new monitoring efforts enhancing
    monitoring capacity for new POPs in relevant core media, • further development
    of the GMP Data Warehouse (https://www.pops-gmp.org/index.php) to support the
    3rd GMP data collection campaign in 2020 (including new POPs, core matrices, or
    programmes), • improved access to information on environmental and human exposure
    allowing for joint interpretation and assessment of human risks, and • informed
    decision making in chemical management and disease/health control. Open access
    to comparable long-term data from the existing networks (Figure 5) will enhance
    our understanding of temporal and spatial patterns in releases, distribution,
    transport, deposition to and evasion from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.
    Such data will support the validation of regional and global atmospheric models
    for use in the evaluation of different policy options for reducing pollution impacts
    on human health and ecosystems. Download : Download high-res image (571KB) Download

    and no trend/not available trend in grey. Size of the circle represents the median
    of the concentrations (Hůlek et al., 2020). 2.4. iCUPE: integrative and comprehensive
    understanding on polar environments Background. The iCUPE project was motivated
    by the critical role of the polar regions in the Earth System functioning being
    the most rapidly changing environment in the on-going climate change (Steffen,
    2006, Overland et al., 2019). Particularly global megatrends, such as globalization
    and consequent demand for natural resources are driving the accelerated climate
    change in the fragile polar environments. In order to tackling the grand challenges,
    there is a need for comprehensive ground-based and satellite observational data
    to monitor the current state of the environment (Kulmala et al., 2021). Workflow.
    The iCUPE concept and work answered to this critical gap in several ways: a. iCUPE
    contributed to the Roadmap for Arctic Observing and Data Systems (ROADS) of Sustaining
    Arctic Observing Networks (SAON). This roadmap transformed the SAON approach towards
    a systematic design and implementation of observations. At the same time, the
    roadmap introduced a new concept of Shared Arctic Variables (SAVs) (Murray and
    Members, 2020), which co-developed with the Arctic stakeholders to incorporate
    diverse perspectives, knowledge and data across thematic domains and Social Benefit
    Areas (SBA). Furthermore, the multidisciplinary infrastructure development and
    integration between marine and terrestrial ecology was tackled in Arena for gap
    analysis of the existing Arctic Science Co-operation (AASCO) process funded by
    Prince Albert Foundation for 2020–2022. Here iCUPE contributed to delivering science-based
    insights (Petäjä et al., 2021) for the Arctic policy making, for example pertinent
    to climate change in that can drive globalization, new transport routes, demography,
    and the use of natural resources. b. iCUPE contributed to the urban air quality
    and environmental impacts of anthropogenic activities in Arctic cities. In this
    way, iCUPE is thematically connected to SMURBS but with an Arctic angle. The World
    Meteorological Organization (WMO) through the UN SDGs and New Urban Agenda promotes
    resilient city development. A key ingredient in this activity is science-based
    Integrated Urban Weather, Environment and Climate Systems and Services (IUS) in
    the changing climate. On a global scale, the WMO developed Urban Integrated Hydro-Meteorological,
    Climate and Environmental Services (Baklanov et al., 2020, Grimmond et al., 2020)
    and very recently more than 30 cities around the World have provided examples
    on how different IUS have been planned or already implemented in their administrative
    frameworks (Anon, 2019,Anon, 2021). The work is closely performed with WMO Global
    Atmospheric Watch Urban Research Meteorology and Environment project (GURME) (Sokhi
    et al., 2021). However, there is a lack of Arctic cities in this work. In close
    coordination with the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) associated
    PACES (air Pollution in the Arctic: Climate, Environment and Societies) project,
    iCUPE contributed to the development of the twin-city concept (Simpson et al.,
    2018). The driving force is the notion that the Arctic cities suffer from very
    poor air quality particularly during winter-time, when the cold weather enhances
    the need for heating concurrently with the very stable Arctic boundary layer,
    which hinders vertical dilution of the pollution. Under these conditions the ground-level
    air pollutant concentrations can reach very high concentrations (Arnold et al.,
    2016). In the twin-city concept, we develop observational capacities and provide
    science-based data for the Arctic cities across the circumpolar Arctic. The key
    cities contributing to this work are Fairbanks in Alaska, Apatity and Norilsk
    in Russia (Konstantinov et al., 2018). Other Arctic cities are welcome to join
    the initiative in the years to come. c. The iCUPE work is driven by the same conventions
    as iGOSP in relation to mercury (Minamata convention) and Stockholm Convention
    on Persistent Organic Pollutants. Again, the role of iCUPE was to provide the
    specific view from the Arctic environment. As a practical step in responding to
    these conventions and policy needs, iCUPE developed 24 multiplatform data sets,
    which connect to UN Sustainable Development Goals (Noe et al., 2022). Applications.
    The main outcomes from iCUPE are the novel and comprehensive data sets (Table
    4) (Noe et al., 2022). In addition, modelling work of (McLachlan et al., 2018)
    with the key method developments during iCUPE provided novel model results on
    concentration of Polychlorinated biphenyl-153 in breast milk at a global scale.
    This was done by integrating the results from the multimedia fate and transport
    model BETR Global 3.0 (MacLeod et al., 2011) and the human exposure model ACC-HUMAN
    (Czub and McLachlan, 2004). The former provided the emission estimates and environmental
    concentration data while the latter depicted the chemical transfer to humans.
    The results indicated that the human exposure in the Arctic is driven by accumulation
    through the marine food chain, which is in turn proportional to concentrations
    of pollutants in air and marine water. In addition, there is a high uncertainty
    on the Arctic diet scenario, and there are very little Arctic monitoring data
    for comparison. The work expanded towards decabromodiphenyl (e.g., BDE-209, a
    brominated flame retardant) (Vorkamp et al., 2019) in the Arctic environment,
    which require considering partitioning of the pollutant between the gas and aerosol
    phases. Further analysis is limited by availability of observational data in the
    Arctic. Particularly iCUPE datasets on emerging organic contaminants from the
    Arctic composed of datasets for air, snow, and water, responded to this need.

    The iCUPE data sets and applications (Table 4) enable defining and monitoring
    of Arctic Essential Variables and sets up processes towards SDGs (Figure 6). The
    most pertinent SDGs for iCUPE include health (SDG 3), clean water resources and
    sanitation (SDGs 6 and 14), life below water because of Arctic fisheries are important
    both locally and globally traded food source (SDG 14). SDG 13, the climate action,
    is a crucial target as the Arctic is warming faster than the global average. The
    changes in the sea ice in the future, in connection with the enhanced mobility
    through the Arctic will open new opportunities for global transport routes. The
    natural resources in the Arctic (natural gas, oil, and other resources) and their
    extraction will influence the greenhouse gas emissions as well as short-lived
    climate forcers, such as black carbon through flaring. These topics were addressed
    by the iCUPE datasets, for example through novel analysis of Arctic artificial
    light sources, which are indicative for oil and gas extraction. The long-term
    aerosol observations provided perspectives on the concentrations of short-lived
    climate forcers and the detailed data set on aerosol source analysis gave insights
    into relative roles of local and remote pollution sources. These data sets contributed
    towards pollution emission mitigation measures, which supports promotion of clean
    energy (SDG 7), clean air (SDG 3) and climate benefits (SDG 13) (Petäjä et al.,
    2021). In this respect iCUPE contributed to the work of the Arctic Council Arctic
    Monitoring and Assessment Programme on Short-Lived Climate Forcers including the
    use of observations for evaluation of models run with state-of-the-art emission
    inventories and to the related EU Action on Black Carbon in the Arctic (EUA-BCA)
    which reviews and proposes black carbon emission reduction measures for specific
    sectors that affect the Arctic such as gas flaring. Download : Download high-res

    2.5. Key-enabling technologies The objective of strengthening the European Research
    Area on EO to better support decision-making addressing environmental policies
    requires to face the so-called Big Earth Data and Open Science challenges. Indeed:
    a) the interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary character of global policies demand
    the access to and integration of heterogeneous data and information sources (Variety
    challenge); b) the complexity of the Earth System requires fast processing of
    a huge amount of observations and models’ generated data sets to elaborate reliable
    indicators and indexes (Volume and Velocity challenges); c) the necessary transparency
    of the decision-making process imposes the capability to share and run computational
    models in complex workflows (Open Science challenge). Luckily, the fast advancements
    in digital information technologies provides great opportunities for addressing
    these challenges. ERA-PLANET proposed, designed and developed a set of transversal
    technological solutions, leveraging the existing efforts at global and European
    level, to efficiently and effectively enable the development of multidisciplinary
    applications for decision-makers. They constitute the so-called ERA-PLANET Key
    Enabling Technologies (KETs) supporting the EO information lifecycle from the
    acquisition of observation to the generation of knowledge in alignment with the
    evolution of the international and European context (Nativi et al., 2021). In
    particular: • The challenge related to the variety of data sources - e.g., in
    terms of data formats and access protocols - has been addressed adopting de-iure
    and de-facto geospatial standards2 • The Virtual Earth Laboratory (VLab) framework
    (Nativi et al., 2013, Santoro et al., 2016, Santoro et al., 2020) enables the
    sharing of computational models as source code or executable code and their execution
    as Web services or on multiple clouds including Copernicus DIAS, EOSC, AWS (https://confluence.geodab.eu;
    https://vl.geodab.org). ERA-PLANET through its transversal activities in the four
    transnational projects, developed science-policy interfaces aimed to close the
    science-policy gap, bringing scientific results to the public and specifically
    to policy-makers. According to its conceptual framework, each project specifically
    worked for enabling the ‘data to knowledge’ transition as a necessary shift of
    perspective for supporting environmental decision. Beside the ERA-PLANET KETs,
    the four Transnational Project experimented technological solutions and good practices
    to address their specific requirements: • Smart Urban Solutions were provided
    to answers relevant policy questions and suggest possible solutions for air quality,
    urban growth and disasters. They rely on advanced in situ monitoring networks,
    modelling tools for assessing air quality impacts on human health by means of
    innovative platforms and Internet of Things, mapping tools for migrant host areas
    and urban detection of changes, monitoring of urban land deformation, tools for
    planning and mitigation of health impacts due to extreme weather events, and tools
    for urban and peri-urban fires detection and management (Gerasopoulos et al.,
    2022). • Data cube technologies have been experimented for serving Analysis Ready
    Data feeding the computational models running through the VLab for the generation
    of indicators and indexes (Mazzetti et al., 2022). • The formalization of knowledge
    through the integration of domain and EO ontologies in the VLab has been experimented
    to build the ERA-PLANET Knowledge Platform. • Knowledge hubs and dashboards have
    been developed to provide an entry point and friendly user-interfaces for decision
    makers entangled with environmental policies with respect to air, water and human
    matrices contamination by toxic substances, like mercury and persistent organic
    pollutants (De Simone et al., 2022, Hůlek et al., 2020). Tools for data sharing,
    data analysis and assessment of policy-option are provided for mercury and persistent
    organic pollutants allowing evaluation of human health risk. • Datasets and applications
    can enable defining and monitoring of Arctic Essential Variables and sets up processes
    towards SDGs. While the long-term aerosol observations provided perspectives on
    the concentrations of short-lived climate forcers and the detailed data set on
    aerosol source analysis gave insights into relative roles of local and remote
    pollution sources. • The four projects fully adopted the Data Sharing and the
    Data Management Principles developed in GEO with the main objective to make data
    accessible and the process of knowledge creation reproducible and transparent.
    The articles published in this special issue provide specific details on the conceptual
    and technical implementation of workflows for enabling the transition from data
    to knowledge for decision-makers by the four transnational projects. 3. Discussion
    on research and innovation challenges and opportunities brought by ERA-PLANET
    to science-policy interfaces ERA-PLANET has demonstrated how EO data can be transformed
    into knowledge to support decision-makers and policy implementation, by developing
    specific policy-driven workflows under four domains: smart cities and resilient
    societies, resource efficiency and environmental management, global changes and
    environmental treaties, and polar areas and natural resources. The workflow designed
    and implemented under each domain has brought to the design, development and implementation
    of Key Enabling Technologies to enhance ‘data to knowledge’ transition for supporting
    environmental policy making. EO-driven solutions were provided by SMURBS to address
    environmental urban pressures. A real-world laboratory was implemented to test
    and evaluate how easily and efficiently EO can be used to address urban issues,
    focusing on air pollution (including health implications), natural and manmade
    disasters and urban growth (including migration aspects). A solution to provide
    rapidly SDG monitoring indicator was described and brought to the reader. GEOEssential
    has improved the development of the Essential Variable concept to improve our
    capacity to address intertwined environmental and development policies as a Nexus.
    A general workflow providing EO-based knowledge to policy-makers to adopt sustainable
    decisions was devised based on the assessment of specific SDG indicators (SDG
    2.4.1, SDG 6.4.2, SDG 11.3.1, SDG 15.1.1, SDG 15.3.1). A new integrated approach
    for global real-time monitoring of environmental quality with respect to air,
    water and human matrices contamination by toxic substances was provided by iGOSP.
    Knowledge Hubs designed and implemented provide the data repository system integrated
    with data management console and knowledge information system based on policy-driven
    scenarios. A strict interaction with policy-makers has driven the development
    of tools and applications based on policy-relevant questions for contributing
    to the on-going activity at the Conference of Parties level. iCUPE developed novel
    and comprehensive data sets and a modelling activity that contributed to delivering
    science-based insights for the Arctic region. Applications enable defining and
    monitoring of Arctic Essential Variables and sets up processes towards SDGs. It
    also was determinant in the work of the Arctic Council Arctic Monitoring and Assessment
    Programme on Short-Lived Climate Forcers including the use of observations for
    evaluation of models run with state-of-the-art emission inventories and to the
    related EU Action on Black Carbon in the Arctic. The ERA-PLANET consortium brought
    the legacy of this large EO program into relevant science-policy initiatives,
    with the objective to make scientific outputs more usable in support of policy
    co-design and assessment (Dilling and Lemos, 2011). The developed applications
    demonstrate how scientific outcomes can be made usable in a way that is more responsive
    and flexible to user needs (Dilling and Lemos, 2011). It highlighted that EO data
    (i.e. remote sensing data providing information on physical and chemical parameters
    that describe an environment or a process) and derived products are themselves
    knowledge for scientists but not for decision-makers, and that such data require
    a transformation process. For example, satellite data on marine water temperature
    are numbers well known to experts but very obscure to the latter, while temperature
    maps are very familiar. GEO as a key reference intergovernmental programme on
    EO is leveraging the international efforts to achieve the objectives of international
    environmental policies, which include, but are not limited to, the UN 2030 Agenda
    on Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the Sendai
    Framework for Disasters Risk Reduction, and more recently the goals of the New
    Urban Agenda. GEO is delivering solutions to bridge the gap between science and
    policy as well as to foster a wider access to end-users to environmental observations
    (Giuliani et al., 2018). The mediated approach proposed by ERA-PLANET for science-policy
    interface can be categorized as a co-production interaction that leverages much
    more knowledge than a traditional science-push, policy-pull interaction (Dunn
    et al., 2018). 4. Conclusion To ensure an efficient science-policy interaction
    a major shift and change of paradigm is required to scientists because the type
    and format of the information and knowledge needed to support the decision-making
    process often seems different if compared to those needed to address other end-users’
    needs. Decision-making is characterized by a strong focus on trust and transparency,
    and consequently on handling quality and uncertainty evaluations throughout the
    process (Kano and Hayashi, 2021). ERA-PLANET contribution to policy-oriented decision-making
    required the definition and implementation of a clear and sound science-policy
    interface, which was even more challenging when moving from global/regional to
    national/local scale (Sutherland et al., 2013). This stimulated the clarification
    of the role and contribution from different groups of stakeholders, including
    the science component for generating the required knowledge (data, models), the
    engineering component to deliver high-level products and services, the end-users,
    but also intermediate users such as applications’ developers who create tools
    tailored to decision-makers. It should be noted that the interaction with end-users,
    especially with the local stakeholders (e.g., city authorities and planners),
    is still weak in GEO and ERA-PLANET has played a significant role with a solid
    ground for future empowerment. Such real strategic interaction has facilitated
    mutual understanding and improved knowledge transfer (López-Rodríguez et al.,
    2015, Rosli, 2015, Porter et al., 2019). EO and Earth Science both play a fundamental
    role for supporting policy-making since most of the policy goals and targets include
    relevant environmental components. However, it is worth noting that most policy
    targets are inherently multidisciplinary, posing key challenges on integrating
    knowledge from different scientific domains for delivering effective tools and
    services, like for example through a participatory science-policy interface mechanism
    (Bremer and Glavovic, 2013, MacDonald et al., 2016). In the international context
    were “planet sensing” can strongly support the environmental shift, ERA-PLANET
    has drawn a comprehensive approach to the generation and delivery of insights
    and knowledge from EO and Earth Sciences to policy- and decision-makers (Plummer
    et al., 2010). Several solutions were proposed to reinforce the science-evidence
    component of policy-oriented multidisciplinary applications. Enhancing the EO
    / in-situ data ecosystem would be a direct contribution to the creation of data
    spaces and an indirect contribution to deliver effective and trusted tools including
    Digital Twins. Supporting the transition from EO data to Earth system knowledge
    for decision-makers would be a direct contribution to the creation of an effective
    and efficient science-policy interface and a contribution to the European Key
    Enabling Technologies for the EO data value-chain. Finally, the reinforcement
    of EO data exploitation by knowledge generation on environmental conditions will
    benefit a plethora of actors ranging from sensor operators, data providers, infrastructure
    operators, service providers, to mention a few. The delivery of services will
    generate specific EO business revenues that is expected to grow exponentially
    in forthcoming years. Author statement The paper has been conceptualized with

  description: With the rapid promotion of construction work of intelligent coal mines
    in China, the development of geological security system software for safe and
    intelligent coal mining has became an urgent task at present. This paper develops
    a coal safety intelligent mining geological security system software with MySQL8.0,
    VS2019, OpenGL and other development tools base on geological conditions of coal
    mines of Shaanxi Coal Group. The systemconsists of six subsystems:geological information
    management, integrated 2 / 3D modeling, mining geological condition evaluation
    and prediction, working face fine geological modeling, geohazard warning and geological
    big data analysis. Geological information management subsystem mainly stores and
    manages geological, surveying, geophysical prospecting and other information,
    and provides basic data for 3D geological modeling, mining geological condition
    evaluation and prediction, geohazard warning, fine geological modeling of working
    face and big data analysis. 2 / 3D integrated modeling subsystem can draw various
    2D drawings and build 3D geological models to further provide coal mine geologists
    with the necessary drawings and visualized 3D models. Mining geology evaluation
    and prediction subsystem can evaluate the complexity of geological structure,
    evaluate and predict the risk of water surging from roof / floor, gas disaster
    and impact ground pressure, comprehensively evaluate geological conditions of
    mining and classify mine geological types, and provide 2D drawings and 3D models
    for workface layout and geohazard warning. Workface fine geological modeling subsystem
    can fuse various kinds of geological information such as workface roadway realistic
    printing, drilling and geophysical prospecting, to build a high-precision 3D geological
    model of the workface, and the model can update dynamically through those constantly
    changing information, and further provide planning cut-off data for intelligent
    workface retrieval. Geohazard warning subsystem can carry out distance warning
    and real-time warning of water damage, gas disaster and impact pressure disaster
    base on the evaluation and prediction results of mining geological conditions,
    census results of hidden disaster-causing factors and real-time monitoring data
    of hydrology, gas and impact pressure to provide disaster warning guarantee for
    safe mining of workface. Geological big data analysis subsystem can perform multi-source
    data statistical analysis, machine learning and deep learning, providing analysis
    methods for the utilization of coal mine geological big data. The navigation subsystem
    can be used to query the achievements of geological security system construction.This
    software system has been applied in Hongliulin coal mine, which basically meets
    the requirements of intelligent mine construction for geological security software
    system and supports safe and intelligent coal mining.

    Volumetric soil water content (VSWC) is a basic consideration for crop growth
    and development and plays an important role in plant photosynthesis, respiration,
    transpiration, and mineral transport. Real-time monitoring of the VSWC plays an
    important role in crop drought warning, precision irrigation, and yield estimation
    (Abioye et al., 2020, Sadri et al., 2020). The rapid acquisition of crop water
    demand information is the basis of intelligent diagnosis and precision irrigation,
    and real-time VSWC and plant water status monitoring can effectively obtain crop
    water demand information in real time (Han et al., 2014, Vera et al., 2019). Real-time
    VSWC monitoring can help managers develop irrigation plans and achieve intelligent
    irrigation management (Vera et al., 2019, Okasha et al., 2021). Currently, real-time
    monitoring of VSWC is mainly carried out using sensors, radiation methods (e.g.,
    neutron moisture meters (NMM)), and remote sensing (Thompson and Gallardo, 2003,
    Gallardo et al., 2013, Yuen et al., 2000, Evett, 2003, Kibria et al., 2021). The
    NMM is accurate; however, it is expensive, contains radioactive material, and
    is seldom used because of safety concerns (Robock, 2003). The limitations of remote
    sensing include coarse spatial resolution (~9–60 km grid cells), shallow depth
    of VSWC measurement (approximately the top 5 cm of the soil column), and low accuracy
    for rougher surfaces (Peng et al., 2017, Sahaar et al., 2022); thus, it is not
    practical for on-going farm management. Therefore, sensors have been widely used
    to monitor VSWC in agriculture. There are four main types of medium sensors to
    measure VSWC: time-domain reflectometry (TDR), frequency-domain reflectometry
    (FDR, or capacitance), time-domain transmissiometry (TDT), and amplitude-domain
    reflectometry (ADR) (Incrocci et al., 2020). Furthermore, FDR has the advantages
    of no maintenance requirements, simple installation, accurate measurements, and
    low cost (Fares and Polyakov, 2006). Its probe can also be connected to traditional
    data collectors, which perform well in the automatic and continuous monitoring
    of VSWC. Therefore, FDR is the most common class of dielectric sensors used for
    smart farmland VSWC monitoring (Thompson and Gallardo, 2003, Gallardo et al.,
    2013). The 5TE sensor (70 MHz, Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA, USA, FDR type) is
    important for VSWC monitoring (Pardossi et al., 2009). These sensors make use
    of microwave measurement technology to measure the VSWC by measuring the relative
    dielectric constant of the soil, which can provide accurate field VSWC measurements
    (Dobriyal et al., 2012, Zemni et al., 2019). They have the advantages of automatic
    monitoring and simple operation and can be measured by directly connecting to
    the data collector (Vaz et al., 2013). However, studies have found that the dielectric
    constant measured by 5TE sensors changes with temperature, and dielectric loss
    occurs when measuring the dielectric constant of electrically charged soil (clay)
    or soil with high salinity (Bittelli et al., 2008). Therefore, different soil
    types need to be calibrated before using 5TE sensors because of the different
    physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the soil (Kodešová et al.,
    2011). Specifically, 5TE sensors are more sensitive to salt, and the conductivity
    of soil under high-salt conditions affects the 5TE sensors’ measurement accuracy
    (Visconti et al., 2014, Zemni et al., 2019). In previous studies, 5TE sensors
    have mainly been used as a platform for VSWC monitoring (Baram et al., 2016, Gamage
    et al., 2019), but there have been few reports regarding their data collection
    and processing processes. The conventional VSWC monitoring interval is generally
    set to be measured every minute or hour, but data acquisition is uninterrupted
    and real-time (Liu et al., 2020), so the amount of data is substantial. This requires
    a more stringent VSWC data processing and analysis. Conventional processing and
    analysis methods cannot fully and deeply analyse the data. Previous studies have
    indicated that sensors are placed in specific spatial areas to collect VSWC data
    at key time nodes or growth periods. VSWC data were analysed based on geostatistics,
    and the spatial variability of VSWC was explored. (Liu et al., 2005; Li and Huang,
    2016; Liu et al., 2020) Therefore, reasonable processing and analysis of the real-time
    data collected by the 5TE sensor has become the key to using data to serve production
    and solve practical problems. Thus, it is necessary to study the 5TE sensor VSWC
    monitoring time-interval optimisation program. Image technology has become increasingly
    widely used in agriculture due to its advantages, such as high speed, high efficiency,
    and precision (Saxena et al., 2014). However, the application of image processing
    to the analysis and processing of VSWC data is new. VSWC analysis using image
    technology focused on the inversion of soil surface moisture by using remote sensing
    or satellite image modelling (Loew et al., 2006, Zhou et al., 2015) or using a
    camera or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) equipped with thermal infrared to obtain
    the digital processing of soil surface photos by extracting the average grey value
    and other characteristic image parameters and VSWC measurement value modelling
    to predict surface VSWC (Wang et al., 2018, Chang and Hsu, 2018). Previous research
    mainly focused on monitoring surface VSWC and monitoring of deep VSWC using VSWC
    imaging technology has not been systematically reported. Previous studies have
    shown that VSWC has spatial variability. After the VSWC data collected by the
    \"grid method\" are interpolated based on the principles of geostatistics, a contour
    map of the spatial distribution of VSWC can be obtained (Liu et al., 2020; Zhang
    et al., 2017). Thus, it is feasible to identify and analyse the characteristic
    information of the VSWC contour map through image technology. Image processing
    is a technology that uses a computer to process image information. In image analysis,
    the quality of the image directly affects the design of the recognition algorithm
    and the accuracy of the effect. Hence, before image analysis (feature extraction,
    segmentation, matching, and recognition, etc.), pre-processing is necessary (Förstner,
    2000, Akram et al., 2010). And its methods include greyscale, geometric transformation,
    and image enhancement. Thence, choosing an appropriate pre-processing algorithm
    in the experiment is the key point for image technology to identify and analyse
    the characteristic information of the VSWC contour map. Based on the purposes
    described above, this study explores the optimal time node for 5TE VSWC sensing
    observations as an example. VSWC data during the entire cotton growth period were
    collected by burying 5TE sensors in the soil of a cotton field. The data were
    analysed to achieve the following goals: (1) to propose a suitable VSWC contour
    map image processing algorithm and construct a suitable and efficient data analysis
    process; and (2) to determine a reasonable time interval for data collection,
    reduce the frequency of observations under the premise of ensuring the accuracy
    of VSWC measurements, and achieve energy savings and efficient data analysis.
    2. Materials and methods 2.1. Site description The experiment was conducted at
    the experimental site of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (40°51 N,81°30E)
    in Alar City, Xinjiang Province, China, in 2018. The study region has a typical
    inland extremely arid climate experiencing drought all year round and extreme
    weather often. The total annual rainfall was 49 mm; the annual evaporation was
    2218 mm; the annual number of sunshine hours was 2960; the annual average temperature
    was 10.6 °C; the accumulated temperature ≥ 10 °C was 4113 °C (frost-free period
    was 210 d); the annual average wind speed was 1.5 m s−1; and the gale days (the
    instantaneous wind speed in a day > 10 m s−1) were 57 d. The soil in the test
    field was sandy loam, and its chemical properties were as follows: soil pH (soil:
    water, 1:2.5) of 7.2, organic C (potassium dichromate volumetric method-external
    heating) of 12.3 g kg−1, total N (Kjeldahl method) of 1.4 g kg−1, available P
    (NaHCO3 extraction-molybdenum-antimony anti-colorimetry method) of 28.8 mg kg−1,
    and exchangeable K (NH4OAc extraction-flame photometry method) of 147.6 mg kg−1.
    The initial soil salt content of the experimental region was 2.1 g kg−1(saturated
    extract EC = 1.9 ds m−1), which represents a slightly saline-alkali land. 2.2.
    Basic physical properties of the soil The basic physical properties of the soil
    are listed in Table 1. Soil bulk density was defined as the ratio of oven-dried
    soil mass to unit volume. Undisturbed soil core samples were collected using a
    stainless-steel coring ring (50 mm internal diameter and 50 mm length) from the
    experimental site at 0–20, 20–40, 40–60, 60–80, and 80–100 cm depths. The soil
    cores were oven-dried at 105 °C for 24 h. The mass of the soil dried in the oven
    was then divided by the core volume to calculate soil bulk density. Saturated
    moisture refers to the maximum capacity of soil to hold water, including capillary
    and non-capillary pores, when all soil pores are filled with water under natural
    conditions. According to the Wilcox method (Wilcox, 1951), stainless steel coring
    rings were used to collect standard soils from the study site. After soaking the
    standard soil in water for 24 h, it was directly dried at 105 °C until the weight
    of the soil remained unchanged, which is known as the oven-dry weight. The formula
    used was as follows: saturated moisture (%) = (mass of moist soil − mass of oven-dried
    soil)/ mass of oven-dried soil/ soil bulk density × 100%. Field capacity is the
    point at which the soil water-holding capacity reaches its maximum for the entire
    field. Permanent wilting point is the moisture content of a soil at which plants
    wilt and fail to recover when supplied with sufficient moisture and is usually
    the amount in soil held by a force stronger than 15 bar, 4.2 pF or 225 psi. Field
    capacity and permanent wilting point were determined by plotting the soil moisture
    characteristic curve (dehydration curve). The soil moisture of the undisturbed
    samples was determined by the centrifuge method (CR-21 G, Hitachi Inc) under 12
    water suction conditions: 1, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 200, 400, 600, 800, and
    1000 kPa. The Van Genuchten model (Genuchten and Th, 1980) was used to fit the
    soil moisture characteristic curve using RETC software developed by the American
    Saline Soil Laboratory. The soil moisture when the soil water suction was 33 kPa
    was regarded as the field capacity, and the soil moisture corresponding to a water
    suction of 1500 kPa was regarded as the permanent wilting point. Table 1. Soil

    are explained in Section 2.2. 2.3. Experimental design Cotton 619 was selected
    as the experimental variety, and the experimental treatment was set to drip irrigation
    with plastic mulches, and the cotton planting and drip irrigation method of \"one
    film, three pipes, and three rows” (Fig. 1). A disposable single-wing labyrinth
    drip irrigation belt was selected, with specifications of Φ 16, dripper spacing
    of 30 cm, maximum flow of dripper of 3.0 L h−1, and working pressure of 0.1 Mpa.
    A 5TE sensor was used as a VSWC monitoring instrument, and the sensors were arranged
    underground in a \"grid method\" (Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image

    Layout method of the 5TE sensor. Specifically, lines perpendicular to the ground
    and parallel to the ground were drawn at 0, 20, 40, 60, and 80 cm in the horizontal
    direction and 10, 30, 50, 70, 90, and 110 cm in the vertical direction. To form
    a grid, a total of 30 5TE sensors were arranged at the intersection of the grid.
    Before the experiment, winter and spring irrigations were carried out, and the
    irrigation quota was 1500 m3 hm−2. The irrigation quota of drip irrigation cotton
    was set at 25–35 mm in the experiment, and the cotton was irrigated 12 times during
    the growing period in this experiment. The salinity of irrigation water was less
    than 0.5 g L−1, and the electrical conductivity was less than 0.9 dm s−1. The
    water requirement of cotton in the experimental region was 726.22–810.22 mm (Wang
    et al., 2016). The remaining field management measures were consistent with the
    local conventional fields. 2.4. 5TE sensor calibration 5TE sensors can output
    soil permittivity ( ), apparent soil electrical conductivity ( ), and temperature.
    Under high-salinity conditions (high level), the permittivity measurement deviates
    with the increase in , especially in sensors with frequencies below 200 MHZ (Kargas
    et al., 2017). Additionally, according to Robinson et al. (1999), it can be accurately
    measured by introducing the effect, and the calibration model (formula 1) can
    adapt to a high level (2.5 ds m−1). (1) where denotes the corrected permittivity.
    Using this formula, we can eliminate the influence of . 2.5. Data collection and
    processing 2.5.1. Data collection The data acquisition motherboard for automatic
    VSWC monitoring in this experiment was developed by the smart cotton agriculture
    innovation team at the Cotton Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural
    Sciences. The data were stored in the cloud. The monitoring time was from 0:00 h
    on 18 May to 23:00 h on 22 September. The total amount of original VSWC data collected
    was 3024 × 30 (excluding the time stamps). 2.5.2. Data processing Fig. 3 shows
    a flow chart of data processing. The original data were selected every 2, 3, 23,
    and 24 h, and 23 datasets were reconstructed, which were set as T1, T2., T23,
    and the collected raw data (every 1 h) were used as a control check (CK). Download

    Flow chart of VSWC data processing. 3D visualisation modelling of 24 data sets
    was performed using Voxler 4.0 (Golden Software Inc., USA). The resolution of
    the x-, y-, and z-axes was set to 80 × 100 × 3024, and the kriging interpolation
    was selected for modelling in the spatial domain. The linear interpolation method
    was selected in the time domain and sliced according to the hour; the output format
    was a DAT file. Surfer 18.0 (Golden Software Inc., USA) was used to draw the DAT
    files into a contour map. Image similarity detection was performed between the
    slice images of CK and the other 23 processed slice images. According to the comparison
    of the image similarity of each slice image, the processing with the highest accuracy
    and smallest observation frequency was obtained. 2.6. Calculation method 2.6.1.
    Conversion to VSWC 5TE sensors are calibrated to accurately determine the permittivity
    in the range of 1 (air) to 80 (water) by the manufacturer before delivery. According
    to the Topp equation (Topp et al., 1980), the soil dielectric constant collected
    by 5TE sensors are converted to VSWC at the measured site, thus (2) where is the
    corrected permittivity. 2.6.2. Image greyscale algorithm Greyscale images can
    represent most of the information in an image with less data/information, which
    can save memory and increase the computational speed of the computer. These images
    are often used for pre-processing in most image processing algorithms. Many scholars
    have performed considerable research on greyscale colour images (Ĉadík, 2008;
    Benedetti et al., 2012). Depending on whether the mapping function in an algorithm
    is applied to all pixels in the image, algorithms can be divided into global mapping,
    local mapping, and hybrid methods. Based on research and data searches, in this
    research study, four greyscale algorithms, namely, Luminance, Color2Gray, limited
    contrast adaptive histogram equalisation (CLAHE), and contrast preserving decolourisation
    (CP), were selected to compare and evaluate greyscale images and comprehensively
    screen out the best greyscale effect. 2.6.2.1. Luminance Luminance is a linear
    projection greyscale algorithm based on a red-green-blue (RGB) colour space. It
    is a greyscale algorithm based on global mapping. It has the advantages of simplicity
    and speed and can retain the overall information of the image to a certain extent.
    The core principle of the algorithm is to find an optimal linear projection direction
    in the RGB colour space and convert the colour 3D pixel matrix into a 2D greyscale
    matrix according to the optimal linear projection direction, so that the colour
    image is converted into a greyscale image (Hedjam et al., 2015). The weights of
    the R, G, and B components are based on the formula: (3) 2.6.2.2. Color2Gray When
    a colour image is converted to a greyscale image, important picture features are
    visually lost. The Color2Gray algorithm reduces loss by preserving the important
    features of the colour image (Gooch et al., 2005). The principle of the algorithm
    is to perform a signed chromaticity distance calculation on the CIEL*a*b* chromaticity
    plane and map the chromaticity and brightness changes in the original image onto
    the greyscale image to create a target image that retains the salient features
    of the colour image. The core of the algorithm is to render the target difference
    (grey value difference) of the greyscale image close to the colour difference
    σ (i.e., the difference in brightness and chroma) of the original image using
    the least-squares method. This formula is expressed as follows: (4) (5) (6) (7)
    where is the difference between the brightness value L of picture pixel i and
    the surrounding pixel j in the CIEL*a*b* space, and and are the differences between
    pixel i and the surrounding pixel j in the a* and b* channels, respectively. The
    difference α is the chromaticity change amount that controls the brightness value
    of the original image, θ determines whether the chromaticity difference will change
    the brightness difference of the original image on the Δa* Δb* chromaticity plane,
    is the normalised vector of θ relative to the axis of Δa* , and is the target
    difference between pixel i and the surrounding pixel j. 2.6.2.3. Limited contrast
    adaptive histogram equalisation (CLAHE) The image histogram is an image grey distribution
    density function, which is an important statistical feature of an image and is
    used to characterise the brightness distribution in a digital image. Adaptive
    histogram equalisation (AHE) is a transformation algorithm that approximates the
    output image to a uniform distribution (Muniyappan et al., 2013). Compared with
    the original image, the brightness of the image after AHE transformation is significantly
    improved, but the salient area in the image becomes more blurred and the background
    noise increases. CLAHE is a calculation method used to eliminate noise and improve
    image contrast. Compared with the image after the AHE transformation, the details
    of the image after the CLAHE transformation are more obvious (Pizer et al., 1987,
    Stimper et al., 2019). The core of the algorithm is to first divide the image
    into multiple small areas before processing, calculate the histogram of each small
    area separately, and limit the contrast to redistribute each histogram. The part
    that exceeds the histogram-clipping limit is evenly distributed to the other parts
    of the histogram. The upper shear limit was obtained as follows: (8) (9) where
    N is the sum of pixels in all small areas, L is the number of grey levels in each
    small area, α is the cut-off coefficient, is the average gray value of each small
    block, q is the mean square error of the cell, is the maximum allowable slope,
    and is the upper clipping limit of the histogram for each small area. 2.6.2.4.
    Contrast preserving decolourisation (CP) The CP is a colour image greyscale optimisation
    algorithm proposed by Lu in 2012 (Lu et al., 2012), which aims to limit the spatial
    pixel interpolation to the maximum extent and allow the appropriate greyscale
    to be automatically selected to maintain the contrast of the original image. It
    uses a finite multivariate polynomial for mapping and mathematically defines the
    polynomial space of colour c = (r, g, b) n times, as follows: (10) where is the
    polynomial space generated by the series of monomials. Therefore, the mapping
    function is expressed as (11) where is the base of the ith term of polynomial
    and is the weight of the corresponding monomial. The mapping function is uniquely
    determined by weight { }. For example, when n = 2, the total number of { } s is
    nine, and the mapping function is a linear combination of elements in {r, g, b,
    rg, rb, gb, r2, g2, b2}. Therefore, the interpolation difference between the two
    grey pixels x and y is determined by parameter { }. In addition, { } is expressed
    as (12) where can be expressed as and can be expressed as , which represents the
    colour contrast of the two pixels x and y in the CIEL*a*b* colour space, when
    and and , = 1; otherwise, = 1. Therefore, the function was minimised and the {
    } parameter set was determined. 2.6.3. Evaluation of converting a colour image
    to a greyscale image Evaluation of the effect of converting colour images into
    greyscale images can be divided into subjective and objective evaluations. Subjective
    evaluation implements a 5-point quality evaluation system. This method is simple
    and intuitive; however, because the observer''s personal factors may cause great
    uncertainty in the observed result, the evaluation result is highly subjective.
    Therefore, this experiment objectively evaluated the image quality of the colour
    image converted to a greyscale image by calculating the average value, standard
    deviation, entropy, average gradient, and edge intensity of the image. Specifically,
    the average value of the image reflects its brightness and the larger the average
    value, the greater the brightness of the image. The standard deviation of the
    image reflects the degree of dispersion between the image pixel and mean values,
    and the larger the standard deviation, the better the image quality. The entropy
    of the image is expressed as the average number of bits of the image grey-level
    set, which describes the average information amount of the image source and is
    the aggregation feature of the image grey-level distribution. The larger the entropy
    is, the greater the value levels that the image contains. The average gradient
    reflects the sharpness and textural changes in an image. The larger the average
    gradient, the clearer the image. The edge of an image refers to a collection of
    pixels with changes in the grey level of the surrounding pixels. The outline of
    the target can be drawn through an edge. This is the most basic feature of an
    image and contains rich internal information for identification. Edge density
    refers to 2D randomness. The edge density function is a variable (x, y) pixel
    with respect to x (or y). The larger the value, the more obvious are the edge
    details of the image. 2.6.4. Principles of image similarity calculation 2.6.4.1.
    Cosine similarity Cosine similarity refers to the use of the cosine of the angle
    between vectors as a measure of the difference between two individuals (Ye et
    al., 2010). An image is a function of space, which can be expressed as a vector,
    and the cosine distance between the vectors is calculated to characterise the
    similarity between the two pictures. Assuming that pictures A and B can be represented
    as two n-dimensional vectors, A is [ , , …, ] and B is [ , , …, ], then the cosine
    of the angle θ between A and B is (13) When the similarity between pictures A
    and B is high, the angle is close to 0°, and the cosine value is close to 1. 2.6.4.2.
    Structural similarity index (SSIM) SSIM is an evaluation index that comprehensively
    measures image similarity from three aspects: brightness, contrast, and structural
    similarity (Wang et al., 2004). According to this definition, the value range
    of the SSIM is [− 1, 1]. As the value approaches 1, the degree of similarity between
    the images increases. Assuming that there are images x and y, the structural similarity
    between the two pictures is. (14) where α, β, and γ represent the importance of
    the corresponding functions in the SSIM, and they are all greater than 0. Constants
    l (x, y), c (x, y), and s (x, y) are images x and y, respectively. The brightness,
    contrast, and structure comparison functions of the three functions are defined
    as follows: (15) (16) (17) where ̅ and ̅ are the average grey values of images
    x and y, respectively; and are the variances of images x and y, respectively;
    is the covariance of images x and y; and , , and are constants. The function is
    to prevent the denominator from becoming zero, so it can be defined as: (18) where
    represents a constant and L represents the greyscale range of the image. To simplify
    the calculation process in actual engineering calculations, it is often assumed
    that α = β = γ = 1, and = /2. Therefore, the SSIM formula can be expressed as
    (19) 3. Results 3.1. Greyscale of the spatial distribution map of VSWC Compared
    to the original image, the image processed by different greyscale algorithms can
    retain its information, but there were obvious differences in image brightness,
    contrast, and sharpness (Fig. 4). The greyscale image processed by the CP algorithm
    was the best in terms of brightness, and the contrast between the light and dark
    parts was the most obvious. The brightness level of the CLAHE algorithm was lower
    than that of the CP algorithm, the clarity was the best, and the detailed texture
    was the most obvious. The Color2Gray algorithm was processed, and the brightness
    of the greyscale image was the darkest, which can effectively retain the global
    contrast of the original image. However, the contrast in local details was not
    obvious, and the sharpness was also poor. The Luminance algorithm had a higher
    sharpness than the Color2Gray algorithm, but the contrast between the light and
    dark parts was not obvious. The overall grey value of the image had a low span.

    3.2. Objective evaluation of the impact of different greyscale algorithms on image
    quality The basic feature statistics based on different greyscale algorithms were
    calculated (Table 2). The brightness of the image pre-processed by the CLAHE and
    Luminance algorithms is similar, and the image pre-processed by the CP algorithm
    had the highest brightness. The pre-processed image quality of the CLAHE algorithm
    was the best, followed by the Luminance, CP, and Color2Gray algorithms. The two
    CLAHE and Color2Gray algorithms had the largest set of image grey values, and
    the image contains the smallest set of grey values after the CP and Luminance
    algorithms were processed. The image pre-processed using the CLAHE algorithm exhibited
    the highest sharpness and obvious texture changes. The edge intensity of the image
    pre-processed by the CLAHE algorithm was 4.09, which was higher than that of the
    luminance and CP algorithms, indicating that the edge details of the image processed
    by this algorithm were more obvious. Table 2. Basic characteristics of images

    accuracy in different time nodes Fig. 5 A shows the changes in image similarity
    between the different processing methods and CK after pre-processing using the
    Luminance greyscale algorithm. The image similarity comparison algorithm of SSIM
    and cosine similarity between different treatments exhibited the same changing
    trend. As the time node increased, the similarity between the treatment and the
    control showed three peaks, which appeared during the T4, T8, and T13 treatments.
    The similarity values were 99.2%, 99.4%, and 98.8%; and 99.1%, 99.6%, and 99.3%,
    respectively. Further significant multiple comparisons were made on T8, which
    has the highest similarity to CK processing, and it was found that T8 processing
    under the two image similarity comparison algorithms was not significantly different
    from T9 processing, but it was significantly different from the other processing
    methods. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download full-size

    (Structural similarity index) and Cosine are two image similarity comparison algorithms.
    Lowercase letters in the figure indicate that the difference between different
    treatments under the same image similarity algorithm comparison is significant
    at 5%. Fig. 5B shows the change in image similarity between different processing
    methods and CK after pre-processing by the Color2Gray greyscale algorithm, which
    is consistent with the comparison result of image similarity after pre-processing
    by the Luminance greyscale algorithm. The image similarity comparison algorithm
    of SSIM and cosine similarity between different treatments exhibited the same
    trend. As the time node increased, the similarity between the treatment and the
    control showed a three-peak change, with peaks appearing in the T4, T8, and T13
    treatments. The values were 99.0%, 99.5%, and 98.7%; and 99.1%, 99.6%, and 98.8%,
    respectively. Further significant multiple comparisons were made on T8 with the
    highest similarity to CK processing, and it was found that the similarity of the
    T8 processing method under the two image similarity comparison algorithms was
    significantly higher than that of the other processing methods. Fig. 5C shows
    the change in image similarity between the different processing methods and CK
    after pre-processing using the CLAHE greyscale algorithm. The image similarity
    comparison algorithm of SSIM and cosine similarity between different treatments
    showed the same change trend between treatments. As the time node increased, the
    similarity between the treatment and control presented a double peak (first increasing,
    then decreasing, then increasing, and finally decreasing), with peaks in the T4
    and T9 treatments at 88.4%, 88.3%, 99.4%, and 99.5%, respectively. Furthermore,
    the two treatments with the highest similarity to the CK treatment (T4 and T9)
    were compared. The differences between the T4 treatment and T5, T6, and T9 were
    not significant, and the differences between the T9 treatment and T8 were not
    significant. Fig. 5D shows the change in image similarity between different processing
    methods after CP greying algorithm pre-processing and CK comparison, which is
    consistent with the image similarity comparison result after CLAHE greying algorithm
    pre-processing. The image similarity comparison algorithm of SSIM and cosine similarity
    between the different treatments demonstrated the same trend. As the time node
    increased, the similarity between the treatment and control showed a double peak,
    and the peaks appeared in the T4 and T9 treatments (87.3%, 88.0%, 99.9%, and 99.9%,
    respectively). Furthermore, a significant multiple comparison of the two treatments,
    T4 and T9, with the highest similarity to the CK treatment was carried out, and
    it was found that there were significant differences between the T4 treatment
    and the other treatments. Except for the T9 treatment, there was no significant
    difference from the T8 treatment, and the other treatments showed significant
    differences. 3.4. The influence of the CLAHE algorithm on the similarity data
    of the VSWC contour map After pre-processing the VSWC contour map using CLAHE
    greyscale, this study used the SSIM and cosine similarity algorithm to calculate
    the similarity of each time contour map between the experimental and control group.
    Each batch (treatment) contained 3024 data points. As shown in Fig. 6, the similarity
    value of the image processed by the CLAHE algorithm in the SSIM and cosine similarity
    algorithm calculations is mostly within the normal range, there are fewer outliers,
    and they are concentrated on the side of the smaller value, i.e., \"left skewed\".
    At the same time, compared with the SSIM algorithm, the processing similarity
    calculated by the cosine similarity algorithm is higher, it is more concentrated
    in different processing methods, and its outlier data points are also higher than
    those of the SSIM algorithm. This indicates that the SSIM algorithm, as an image
    similarity comparison algorithm, is more sensitive than the cosine similarity
    algorithm when comparing contour maps. Download : Download high-res image (312KB)

    4. Discussion 4.1. Image description of the spatial-temporal variability in the
    VSWC The VSWC is an important factor that affects crop growth. Maintaining a proper
    VSWC is conducive to achieving high yield, quality, and efficiency for crops.
    Soil moisture has variability in the time and space domains (Zhang et al., 2019;
    Isham et al., 2005; Mälicke et al., 2019), which helps to understand the variability
    of soil characteristics and irrigation requirements of farmland, and time variability
    helps to predict the next irrigation (Pandey and Pandey, 2010). With the help
    of spatial statistics, new ideas can be provided to study the temporal and spatial
    heterogeneity and patterns of VSWC (Das and Mohanty, 2006, Korres et al., 2015).
    Liu et al. (2006) and Zhang et al. (2017) used kriging interpolation on VSWC data
    to draw contour maps, which intuitively described spatiotemporal changes in the
    VSWC. Pandey and Pandey (2010) drew the depth of irrigated fields up to 60 cm
    for soil moisture stratification. A contour map was used to show the characteristics
    of water changes in the farmland before and after irrigation. The VSWC contour
    map represents information on VSWC variability at a specific time and has been
    widely used in previous studies. Based on the contour map representing the spatiotemporal
    variation characteristics of VSWC during the entire growth period of the soil
    cotton field, this study proposes the use of image processing technology to extract
    and identify the characteristic information of the VSWC contour map. In this study,
    the author found through a comparison of image similarity algorithms that the
    similarity algorithm between the images that are closer in time is higher, and
    there is no significant difference; the similarity of images that are far apart
    in time is low, and there are significant differences. The results show that the
    image algorithm is credible for identifying the accuracy of the VSWC contour map
    and is a reliable method. 4.2. The influence of greyscale algorithm pre-processing
    on the image quality of the VSWC contour map Image processing technology has made
    great progress in the application of crop identification and classification, pest
    identification and classification, agricultural product classification, crop yield
    estimation, and plant phenotype identification (Barbedo et al., 2013; Beron et
    al., 2020; Singh et al., 2018). The algorithm is the core of image processing
    technology, and its research depth directly affects the development of image processing
    technology. As the pre-processing of most image processing, the greyscale algorithm
    is particularly important for different types of images. In previous studies,
    according to whether the mapping function in an algorithm can be applied to all
    pixels of the whole image, all current greyscale algorithms are divided into the
    global mapping method, local mapping method, and hybrid method. The global mapping
    greyscale method can better preserve the global structure information (e.g., Luminance,
    Color2Gray), but because all pixels use the same mapping method, the resulting
    image will be smoothed, and a lot of detail information will be lost (Hedjam et
    al., 2015, Gooch et al., 2005). The local mapping greyscale algorithm pays too
    much attention to local information (e.g., CLAHE), which leads to the inconspicuous
    global structure and the serious loss of information in the image, as well as
    halo and noise enhancement (Pizer et al., 1987, Stimper et al., 2019). And the
    hybrid mapping greyscale algorithm maintains both the global structural information
    (e.g., CP) and the local contrast information (Lu et al., 2012). The general analysis
    of the temporal and spatial distribution of VSWC requires professional geostatistical
    software, which increases the difficulty of nonprofessional operations (Liu et
    al., 2020; Oldak et al., 2002). The image processing technology proposed by the
    author to analyse the contour map of the spatial distribution of VSWC is a new
    idea that has been verified and has exhibited good results in this paper. In smart
    agriculture, the greyscale algorithm is the basis of image processing technology
    (Kanan and Cottrell, 2012), and the main image processing algorithms in this study
    must convert the greyscale contour image into a single-channel image before running.
    For this reason, Luminance, Color2Gray, CLAHE, and CP algorithms were chosen as
    greyscale algorithms. The research results show that the brightness, quality,
    sharpness, contrast, and local contour details of the VSWC contour map drawn by
    Surfer software after the greyscale conversion of the CLAHE algorithm are better
    than those of the Luminance, Color2Gray, and CP algorithms, and can maximise the
    retention of the original image information. However, the accuracy of these results
    must be tested and verified during production. 4.3. Reasonable setting of the
    monitoring time node of the VSWC sensor Since Williams and Baker proved that the
    VSWC was closely related to the dielectric properties of the soil in 1982 (Williams
    and Baker, 1982), the technology of indirectly measuring the VSWC by monitoring
    the soil dielectric constant has achieved rapid development. The VSWC measurement
    method based on this principle has gradually become the main method of VSWC measurement,
    owing to its advantages of speed, accuracy, and easy integration. Slama et al.
    (2019) monitored the VSWC content at temporal and spatial levels based on the
    principle of the dielectric constant to simulate the influence of different brackish
    water irrigation regimes on root absorption and solute reflux. Deploying 5TE sensors
    on the soil profile using a spatial grid method can effectively reflect spatial
    and temporal variations in the VSWC. Related research has been promoted and applied
    to production. Previous studies on the use of permittivity for VSWC monitoring
    are still based on spatial distribution and time consumption variation, but there
    are no systematic reports on the application of VSWC monitoring in production,
    especially with respect to the optimisation of the time node of VSWC observations.
    Based on production, the time nodes of VSWC monitoring based on apparent permittivity
    were optimised, and it was found that the optimal time node of VSWC monitoring
    was once every 10 h in sandy loams of typical inland extremely arid climate regions
    under slight salt conditions. However, this conclusion needs to be verified by
    setting up parallel control treatments in future studies. The results of the experiment
    were based on a sandy loam soil under saline conditions. However, the accuracy
    of VSWC measurements by 5TE sensors is affected by many factors, especially soil
    salinity (Zemni et al., 2019). The soil salt content of the experimental site
    was 2.1 g kg−1, which represents saline-alkali land. In saline-alkali soils, the
    permittivity measurement of 5TE sensors affects the performance of VSWC measurements
    owing to the deviation of high soil conductivity (Satoh and Kakiuchi, 2021). Therefore,
    the 5TE sensor must be calibrated before it is used in saline soils. Studies have
    shown that the Hilhorst linear model (Hilhorst et al., 2000), MHK model (Kargas
    et al., 2017), and MHB model (Bouksila et al., 2008) can be used to calibrate
    the apparent permittivity ( ), bulk electrical conductivity ( ), and temperature
    measured by the 5TE sensor in the laboratory and field, thus improving the performance
    of the 5TE sensor in saline-alkali soil and reducing the measurement error. 5.
    Conclusion In this study, by constructing datasets with different time intervals
    and relying on image processing technology to analyse and evaluate the accuracy
    of the data reflected by the data at different time intervals, it can be concluded
    that (1) image processing technology can be used as a spatiotemporal contour map
    of VSWC and a feasible means for extracting variability information; (2) the greyscale
    image algorithm pre-processed by the CLAHE algorithm can retain the information
    of the original image to the greatest extent, and the image quality is high; thus,
    it can be used as a greyscale pre-processing algorithm for the VSWC contour map
    image; and (3) the three greyscale algorithms and the two image similarity comparison
    algorithms in this experiment were calculated. The 10 h dataset had the highest
    similarity with the control group (1 h dataset), and the observation rate was
    the lowest; therefore, the optimal time monitoring node could be set to collect
    VSWC data every 10 h under the conditions of this experiment (cotton field in
    sandy loam under slight salt conditions in typical inland extremely arid climate
    regions). This conclusion provides a theoretical basis for the use of 5TE sensors
    to monitor changes in VSWC and the use of image processing to analyse spatiotemporal
    changes in VSWC, optimise the VSWC monitoring process, and reduce the workload
    of data processing to provide basic information in agriculture for irrigation
    and soil management purposes. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare

  description: Deep foundation pits in coastal areas have the characteristics of high

    pit water level. The real-time monitoring of the water level of the foundation
    pit is an important basis for ensuring the safe operation of the foundation pit
    project. Traditional monitoring methods have disadvantages such as unstable equipment,
    high cost, and poor scalability. Therefore, in this study, a set of online monitoring
    system for deep foundation pit water level was developed by combining Raspberry
    Pi and IoT technology. The system mainly consists of data acquisition layer, data
    management layer, equipment control layer and data display layer, and has good

    system can be controlled remotely, and the water level of foundation pit can be
    collected, stored and transmitted in real time and effectively. At the same time,
    the foundation pit pumping is controlled according to the water level of the foundation
    pit, so as to realize the fine control of the foundation pit pumping and achieve
    the effect of energy saving and emission reduction. Based on relational database
    MySql and B/S architecture, it realizes centralized data management, calculation
    and analysis, charting and other functions. The practical application test shows
    that the system has good stability, reliability and expansibility, improves the
    water level monitoring efficiency of the deep foundation pit in the coastal area,
    and provides a guarantee for the safe construction of the project.

    Location: Xi’an, China SECTION I. Introduction With the rapid rise of Chinese
    urban infrastructure industry, the development of underground space continues
    to develop to a wider and deeper level. Deep foundation pit construction is highly
    susceptible to the influence of groundwater. When excavating in areas where the
    groundwater level is too high, it is often necessary to lower the water level
    of the aquifer to ensure a safe construction environment. The coastal area is
    rich in groundwater deposits, and its hydrogeology is complex and variable [1].
    Affected by groundwater, the construction of deep foundation pits in coastal areas
    is prone to engineering problems such as pipe surge and destabilization [2]. Therefore,
    accurate and timely grasp of the pit water level, the use of scientific precipitation
    measures, to create a water-free or less water construction environment is the
    basic requirement to protect the pit operations. With the advent of the Internet
    of Things era, the traditional manual monitoring means are gradually replaced.
    In the 1960s foreign countries have adopted a full range of monitoring technology,
    and at the end of the last century to achieve the monitoring automation. The monitoring
    technology of foundation pit engineering in China started late, but after years
    of extensive research and practice, its related technology has made great progress.
    Fan et al. established a foundation pit temporal GIS monitoring system using ArcGIS
    Engine technology, which efficiently managed the monitoring data of the foundation
    pit and improved the informatization degree of the monitoring data [3]. Fu et
    al. [4] used the J2EE framework to develop a deep foundation pit safety monitoring
    platform with strong compatibility and high automation. However, the above monitoring
    devices all have the problems of inconvenience of movement, poor scalability and
    high maintenance costs. With the expansion of the microcomputer market demand,
    Raspberry Pi was born and gradually applied in transportation [5]–[7], agriculture
    [8]–[9], medical [10]–[12] and other fields. Jiang et al. [13] propose that in
    the context of Industry 4.0, intensive research and development efforts for large-scale
    complex industrial systems indicate that safety and reliability issues pose significant
    challenges. The traditional monitoring methods have disadvantages such as high
    deployment cost, difficulty, poor scalability and local processing capability
    [14]. Therefore, this study proposes an online monitoring system for pit water
    level based on Internet of Things (IoT) using Raspberry Pi. The system is based
    on Internet of Things and cloud computing technology. The compiled Python program
    is embedded in Raspberry Pi based on Linux environment to realize the functions
    of real-time collection, uploading and pre-processing of water level information
    of foundation pits. It also controls the pit pumping according to the water level
    change. Finally, based on the relational database MySql and B/S framework, the
    data is centrally managed, calculated and analyzed, and graphs are drawn. SECTION
    II. System Design A. Functional Requirements The system implements functions including
    new projects, data storage, data management, analysis and early warning, intelligent
    control, data query, chart generation, etc. The schematic diagram is shown in
    Fig. 1. The embedded operating system is designed to control the collection and
    transformation of pit water level data, and then upload it to the cloud server
    for storage. Through the obtained pit water level and precipitation well flow
    information, the water level is displayed, warned and controlled in real time,
    thus realizing the effective monitoring of pit water level. On the one hand, the
    embedded system stores the real-time raw data and statistical information in MySQL
    database. On the other hand, it uploads the data to the cloud server via HTTP
    protocol, so that users can view the on-site monitoring data and graphs by logging
    in through the webpage. Figure 1. System function architecture Show All B. System
    Composition Framework The system is mainly composed of data sensing layer, network
    layer, support layer and application layer. The platform is built with a combination
    of “LAMP” (ie, Linux operating system, Apache server, MySQL database, and PHP),
    which has the advantages of security and reliability. The components of each part
    are as follows: The data sensing layer and network layer. Raspberry Pi 4B, sensors,
    frequency converters and wireless LAN are used to realize the preprocessing of
    monitoring data, remote data transmission and water pump control. Raspberry Pi
    is a motherboard of an ARM-based microcomputer, equipped with an SD/MicroSD card
    as a storage hard disk. There are 1 to 4 USB ports and an Ethernet port around
    the card motherboard. Among many types, Type A has no network port. Port network
    cable and some input and output devices, such as keyboard and mouse. The Raspberry
    Pi 4B has a total of 40 GPIOs, which can be developed through Python after installing
    the Linux system [15]. By importing RPI.GPIO module, serial module and binascii
    module, the sensor and relay are controlled and data is converted. Set the water
    level threshold in the Raspberry Pi to control the water pump. When the water
    level exceeds the threshold, the smtplib module is used to send an email reminder
    to the monitoring personnel. Sensors include turbine flow transmitters and liquid
    level transmitters. They collect information on foundation pit water levels and
    pumping. The water pump is controlled by relays, and the real-time collected information
    is uploaded to the cloud in combination with wireless LAN. The workflow of the
    data acquisition equipment is shown in Fig. 2. Set the serial port through the
    serial module, and enable the thread to detect whether there is data sent to the
    serial port receive buffer. Read the data in the buffer into the user space, and
    parse the data according to the serial port output protocol of the sensor. Compare
    the water level threshold of the foundation pit, control the opening and closing
    of the water pump, and send the data to the database server through the network.
    The Support Layer. The cloud server adopts the CentOS7.0 operating system in the
    Linux environment. And install MySQL database for underlying data management.
    MySQL database is one of the most popular relational database management system
    application software among developers at present. It has the advantages of small
    size, fast operation speed, safety and reliability, and open source. The MySQL
    database provides the Application Programming Interface (API) for multiple programming
    languages, which is convenient for other languages to quickly call the MySQL database.
    As the most popular open source relational database, MySQL database is widely
    used in Web development. Meanwhile, MySQL database has the characteristics of
    fast processing speed, strong readability and high maintainability. The data is
    stored in the form of two-dimensional tables, the monitoring data and monitoring
    time are recorded, and early warning is made by judging the water level. The logical
    architecture of the MySQL database is shown in Fig. 3. The database connection
    can be realized by calling the connect method. Figure 2. Workflow diagram of data
    collection terminal Show All The application layer. A dynamic website is built
    on the cloud server system through PHP, nginx, and phpmyadmin programs. The communication
    protocol is HTTP protocol, and B/S network architecture is adopted, which has
    the advantages of strong scalability and easy maintenance [16]. The commonly used
    mode of B/S architecture: client-server-database. The three correspond to the
    user presentation layer, business logic layer and data persistence layer respectively.
    The three levels are independent of each other, and the data interaction between
    each level is realized through the interface. It is deployed on the cloud server
    to display the data in real time, so that the administrator can view the water
    level and pumping flow data of the foundation pit in real time. Figure 3. Workflow
    diagram of data collection terminal Show All SECTION III. System Implementation
    and Application A. System Implementation The data acquisition and control system
    is mainly composed of transformer module, acquisition module, control module,
    network module, etc. The connection of the whole set of equipment is shown in
    Fig. 4. The function of the transformer module is to adjust the input voltage
    to different output voltages, which can provide stable voltages for different
    equipment and ensure the safe operation of the entire set of equipment. The acquisition
    module is composed of WL-LWGY turbine flow transmitter and WRT-36 liquid level
    transmitter. It collects data on foundation pit water level and pumping flow,
    supports 4-20mA communication format, and its resolution is 0.001mA. The sensor
    needs to be calibrated before the field test. The control module is mainly composed
    of Raspberry Pi 4B, RS485 communication interface, relay and DC isolation transmitter,
    etc., which can convert the electrical signal data returned by the sensor into
    numerical signal, and adjust the pumping according to the water level information.
    The network module is the network supply device of the system, which adopts the
    way of IoT network card to provide network for the devices. The cloud server adopts
    the cloud server product provided by AliCloud. The Centos 7.0 system under Linux
    environment is configured on the cloud server, and the database running environment
    is built and the ports are configured. Figure 4. Data acquisition and device control
    connection diagram: a) device connection circuit diagram; b) device connection
    schematic Show All B. System Application After on-site inspection of a coastal
    foundation pit project, two sets of equipment were prepared for on-site testing.
    The equipment was debugged and assembled on site. The data acquisition program
    is written in python language, and the serial port is controlled by serial, pymysql
    and other modules. The data is read at intervals of 15 minutes, and the read information
    is uploaded to the cloud at the same time. The front-end display is done through
    programs written in PHP, nginx, phpmyadmin and other languages. It also implements
    the management of data and the generation and download of charts. Fig. 5 shows
    the front-end data display. Figure 5. Relationship between cumulative flow and
    seepage time under different compactness conditions Show All The daily average
    water level information was compared with the manually collected data. As shown
    in Fig. 6, the accuracy of the device can reach 99.94% when comparing the manual
    collection results. The average elevation of the foundation pit cushion of the
    project is −8.0m, while the average monitored water level is −15.35m. It can be
    seen that the water level of the foundation pit does not exceed 0.5m below the
    foundation cushion layer, which satisfies the “Technical Specification for Groundwater
    Control of Building and Municipal Engineering JGJ 111-2016” requirements. Figure
    6. Relationship between cumulative flow and seepage time under different compactness
    conditions Show All SECTION IV. Conclusions This study proposes an online monitoring
    system for pit water level based on Internet of Things (IoT) using Raspberry Pi.
    It realizes the functions of automatic collection, storage, analysis, display
    and feedback of the water level information of the foundation pit. Its characteristics
    are mainly reflected in the following aspects: (1) Intelligent monitoring. The
    sensor nodes deployed in the field can realize the automatic collection and wireless
    transmission of monitoring data to ensure the integrity and reliability of the
    data. (2) High stability. Raspberry Pi can be used for long-term, stable information
    acquisition, and also to control the device. (3) Early warning feedback. Establish
    early warning rules to judge the security status of real-time monitoring data
    and guide managers'' decisions. (4) Strong scalability. Raspberry Pi has rich
    interfaces. With the increase of business requirements, the number of system interfaces
    can be added, and the new interfaces will not affect the original interface functions
    and business logic. (5) Visual management. Based on the relational database MySql
    and B/S framework, it displays the trend of data changes in a visual way. Compared
    with the traditional foundation pit water level monitoring equipment, the system
    has the advantages of stable information collection, automatic equipment control,
    low cost, etc., and realizes the functions of foundation pit water level early
    warning and control of pumping. At the same time, the system has good expansibility,
    which provides the foundation for the improvement of other functions. The practice
    shows that the system has a certain guiding significance for the actual project
    and provides a guarantee for the safe construction of the project. In the future,
    other functions of the system, such as stability monitoring, displacement monitoring,
    and construction progress monitoring, will be improved in combination with actual
    engineering needs. It is expected that the informatization and specialization
    level of foundation pit engineering monitoring technology can be effectively improved
    through this system. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by Zhejiang Province

    By 2050, the number of inhabitants on Earth is assessed to ascend to a huge amount
    of 9100 million occupants. The existing population of 7300 million has plundered
    high right around two-thirds of Earth’s assets [1]. Over the most recent 60 years,
    because of popularity for wares, like fiber, petroleum, food, wood, and new water,
    extra-terrestrial has been allocated to horticulture as compared to eighties and
    nineties time period. The realities disclose that there is presently an unmistakable
    shortfall in regular assets and if the continuous consumption of assets isn’t
    managed in the correct manner, the people in the future won’t have anything to
    encourage [2]. Rainwater system is an essential worry for the improvement of agribusiness
    in agricultural nations. To determine the water system problem, individual specialists
    have put forth a few attempts by proposing imaginative strategies, for example,
    drip water system, mechanized sprinkler innovation, and smart. “Smart Farming
    technique (otherwise called accuracy agribusiness (PA) utilize most recent innovations”,
    for example, IoAT, cyber physical system, big data analytics, intellectual sensing
    and frameworks, and AI procedures to resolve the concern towards asset management
    using demonstrating effective administration of accessible assets. Besides, most
    recent advanced methodologies have additionally contributed colossally in taking
    care of the issue of water deficiency and in the improvement of irrigation system
    approaches, for example, improvement of a computerized framework for agriculture,
    which advises farmer of specific vulnerabilities ahead of time and supports, they
    control such bothersome circumstances [3, 4]. A central segment of the PA framework
    is field planning. The idea of accuracy farming isn’t old; it was induced before
    25 years when inventive innovations, for example, remote sensing networks and
    GPS were introduced [5]. PA is a creative strategy for gathering, scrutinizing,
    and highlighting information, which assumes a vital part in settling on crop the
    executives’ choices [6]. Present-day agriculture is as of now confronting another
    period with expanding creation needs and lessening accessibility. The remarkable
    expansion in population carries with it the need for a more prominent measure
    of creation; the capacity to control assets precisely permits more noteworthy
    control of costs/benefits and assists with checking the exhaustion of characteristic
    assets, for example, streams and soil supplements [7]. PA permits observing of
    environment entities and to have an exact reaction on visualization of plantation
    behavior to tackle explicit issues for each situation [8]. As demonstrated in
    Fig. 1, four primary parts of accurate agriculture cycle which involve every one
    of the various procedures utilized are Sense-Analyze-Predict-Act. Figure 1 represents
    the transformation of a cloud stage administration, is incorporated by sensors,
    which thus forecasts the outcome using the assistance of various models and ultimately
    advises the farmer which assists them with making vital moves and further their
    innovation advanced farming. As portrayed in Table 1, four parts of the accurate
    agribusiness cycle, characterize how the cycles are completed and beneath we see
    what each parameter accomplishes. Fig. 1 Precision agriculture life cycle Full
    size image Table 1 Statistical display of articles according to their research
    fields Full size table 1.1 Precision Agriculture Policies and Performs 1.1.1 Irrigation
    System Taking everything into account, innovative water system frameworks are
    vital in the whole harvest managing process, which incorporates planning of seedbeds,
    usage of supplements, pesticides and insect sprays, growth, harvest and development,
    and re-development of ranch. A profoundly exact and flexible irrigation system
    framework is highlighting a significant part of the PA procedure. 1.1.2 Quality
    Land Management System It is the utilization of tasks, performs, and medicines
    to ensure soil and improve its exhibition. It is significant, straightforwardly
    and by implication both, to efficiency and natural manageability of crops [9]
    and the board assists us with controlling significant agricultural parameters,
    i.e., vegetal wellbeing, its shelter, and soil dampness that assists with giving
    a greater depiction to mix of advancements and farming related sensors to reduce
    expenses and increment harvests, for example, sensors for pH [10]. This sensor
    is able to gauge the focus on intensities of oxygen, particle and hydrogen that
    will help ranchers during anticipating land squabble circumstances [11]. 1.1.3
    Weather Anticipating System The exact ground-level climate data support for surveying
    the usefulness of the rancher’s grounds and becoming further proficient in pest
    and infectious prevention, by staying away from obliteration of harvests and expanding
    the functionality and productivity in their activities [12, 13]. Expanding necessity
    towards IoT to interrelate every one of the parts of both the virtual and real
    sphere has brought about organizations and buyers to vigorously depend on IoT-related
    advances to create headways in their individual arenas. 1.1.4 Data Insight Expansion
    in proficiency and usefulness is the fundamental target of IoT-initiated advances.
    Gathering adequate measures of information to utilize it as an instrument to increase
    buyer involvement is the Holy Grail that most organizations depend on. The assortment
    of sensor investigation to build the information extension guarantees numerous
    advantages in cultivating, chiefly decrease in delays because of outside correspondence,
    which at last aides ranches arranged in country regions with helpless availability
    [14, 15]. 1.1.5 Sustainable Computing With the developing requirement aimed at
    sustainability of assets, the objective of bigger rated associations is to make
    the entire world a superior spot. In the wake of investigating numerous utilizations
    of IoT advances, the Forum of World Economic tracked down that 84% were tending
    to, or might actually discourse, the Sustainable Development Goals of UN. Sustainable
    processing assists with vanquishing a portion of the world''s developing obstacles,
    furthermore, handles those issues by giving arrangements, like Smart Grid. A savvy
    network comprises of all the most recent creating/created IoT manageability innovations.
    It identifies and responds to nearby alterations in use using an electric inventory
    system which utilizes computerized correspondences innovation. 1.1.6 Data Security
    Data Security has a prime job in such turns of events. The extent of information
    and abilities to incites, overall aides cultivate the fundamental correspondence
    between each one of those worried about food creation and the climate based on
    study by the ranchers and ground laborers in the overall logic, wherever [16].
    Playing out a portion of the information investigation straightforwardly inside
    the ranch additionally has number of advantages from the data security perspective.
    Just a synopsis of the homestead checking information will be shared by outsider.
    This will complicate getting explicit touchy data from the information shared.
    1.1.7 Data Analytics Data scrutinization helps with creating significant, preemptive,
    and beneficial choices which can expand openings and effectiveness in the whole
    cycle of smart cultivating. In spite information examination require relevant
    statistics to be effective, and information which is inadequate or inaccurate
    will give experiences that are not completely dissected. Data from sensors fixed
    at filed, assortment of information at every stage, and financial elements of
    choices will keep on being basic for achievement of information examination. 1.1.8
    Cyber Physical Systems Digital actual frameworks will shape an incorporated climate
    of digital and actual items which helps ranchers progressively observing of homesteads,
    soil management and crop-management by demonstrating assortment of data. 2 Legacy
    Systems 2.1 Crop Monitoring System Using IoAT The 3D organizes hub associated
    with the yield distinguishing proof component addresses different IoAT frameworks.
    This framework manages the claim normal for IoT and highlights the prospective
    it needs to increase the accuracy agribusiness strategies. The mishap the anticipated
    model has the consideration of water, environment and soil sensor in a similar
    class as yield recognizable proof, supplement regulator and energy regulator.
    2.2 Camera-Chessboard Array Preparation The principle obstacle in such sort of
    plan is assisting to manage the overlaying of IoT data using each single item
    on the perspectives on the camera. This design course of action goes through a
    specific strategy to see if some forecast blunders occur in the arrangement of
    cameras. The product, utilized to adjust such cameras, is a prior MATLAB tool
    compartment program that supports in discovering the camera forecast blunders.
    Subsequent to handling its programs and making virtual square outlines of their
    showcase and associations, a realistic of the vegetal using camera perception
    is made, that assists the ranchers with for all intents and purposes looking to
    their crops daily. 2.3 Rural Architectural Network It is a WSN empowered organization
    intended to expand crop-management doings to consider justified harvesting choices
    [17, 18]. The proposed architecture gives versatility and covers huge topographical
    areas. It utilizes 6LoWPAN centered WSN grid for detecting and inciting associated
    tasks. Progressing upon past surveys for a multi-camera course of action on a
    smaller ranch, in this research the measure increment and notice various sensors
    hubs dissipated through an enormous farmland region. These hubs play out the detecting
    and impelling tasks all the while, expanding the adaptability and the inclusion
    range. The utilization of IPv6 for this arrangement has been fundamental. In addition
    to the fact that it solves the location space and auto-setup entanglement, but
    on the other hand is joined by the amendment level to present the 6LoWPAN convention
    heap. Little parcel dimension, little data transfer capacity (amongst 250/40/20
    kbps), and other lattice geography downsides are just the beginning of the detriments
    of the 6LoWPAN organization. Despite the fact that it has its own merits, for
    example, energy redeemable overutilization of little fueled attending hubs, the
    key drawback of 6LoWPAN is the absence of use that uses 6LoWPAN due to the broad
    preparation which it needs to acquire acclimated with the innovation and the information
    on IPv6 convention. Information on heap and the usefulness of IPv6 is an absolute
    necessity aimed at the finishing clients dealing with such design. Directing arrangements,
    execution investigation, the structural intricacy of the proposed CLAD convention,
    impacts of climate over the 6LoWPAN related organization and the confirmation
    of nature of administration are for the most part completely gave in the led study
    to really carry out haze and distributed computing innovations in their anticipated
    system. In the new occasions, the utilization of applications related to IoAT
    has expanded dramatically because of its low-energy prerequisites and inclusion
    huge topographical locales. Somewhat recently, LoRaPAN and LoRaWAN advances have
    supplanted customary correspondences conventions, for example, Wi-Fi and Classic
    Bluetooth [19,20,21,22]. For the most part talking, in the haze processing models,
    IoAT based gadgets are associated with heterogeneous gadgets in closeness to IoAT
    clients. The significant difficulties in current applications of IoAT in mist
    registering climate are the executives of accessible assets and booking of routine
    assignments [18, 23]. 2.4 Irrigation System Through Aerial Sight and Central Pivot
    This system, despite the fact that is the nearest thing we need to amplify IoT
    execution, ordinarily the last uses of these advances are not easy to understand.
    The comprehension of the huge potential outcomes of these innovations is a vital
    factor in finding and applying them. Moderation of the information hole is vital
    to utilize the tested innovation proficiently and suitably. With this, security
    issues, information misfortune, and control above lengthier diffusions are additionally
    extraordinary concerns that must be managed. This sort of system is exceptional
    in the constant dissemination of the amount of water in the whole farmland region
    [24, 25]. Each proposed framework enjoys its benefits and burdens, a couple of
    significant benefits and drawbacks that accompany the execution of this framework
    are for watering bigger geological fields. The proposed design requests just 60%
    of water when contrasted with the regular water system frameworks with minimal
    expense and higher productivity. It is basic that customary overhauling and upkeep
    ought to be given to such frameworks to stay away from the chance of glitches,
    which requires colossal starting capital venture [24, 26]. Once more, if the extraordinary
    issues of this proposed model are relieved and vital advances, for example, consideration
    of sponsorships to ranchers are taken to spur them to roll out progressive improvements
    to their homestead and, that is the point at which the agriculture area will begin
    to develop the affirmative manner. Further, we take a gander at keen smart water
    management, which consolidates different advancements, with the objective to add
    the effort of IoT innovations and reason any continuous issues with the current
    designs. Brilliant water the board framework can give constant notice of the water
    system and yield conditions to ranchers, which may help ranchers in taking in
    the nick of time choices. 2.5 Anticipated Methodology This part examined an IoAT
    framework that has been anticipated in this study to give an outline of an IoT
    initiated PA framework, which stages using an order of levels, adjustable administrations,
    and administrations that can be reproduced for normal IoT frameworks alike. As
    of small sensor establishment over the farm to definite overall benefit of end
    clients, such design gives an outline or a plan that can be used for comparable
    IoT frameworks. I. Stage I: Physical Stage An IoT actual stage gadget, for example,
    actuators, sensors, and regulators communicate and robotizes the interaction of
    treatment, aquatic system and the usage of insecticides and insect poisons for
    superior harvest development the executives [27]. The IoAT framework consolidates
    a few customary advances, for example, NFC, distributed computing, RFID, WSNs
    to computerize the harvest the executives measures [28]. WMSN and WSN models transfer
    data using remote networks comprising of numerous interconnected hubs that are
    utilized to detect, measure, and speak through IoT incorporated innovations, which
    assumes a vital part in any IoT incited tests [29]. These designs are extremely
    exact as they follow a particular diagram of the relative multitude of required
    segments, which must be incorporated for effective signal transmission [30]. WMSN
    or WSN enjoy their benefits and impediments and though these segments are the
    innovators of node processing, expansion in proficiency, usability and consistency
    is consistently a worry [31]. In addition, to comprehend the administration of
    anticipated IoT Data prototypes, it is fundamental to dive further into rules
    independent entity-management, which happens at a reasonable stage. WQM is a significant
    obstacle in WSN related systems. Such frameworks request dependability, manageability,
    and ideal nature of administration to convey WQM information over longer distances
    [32,33,34]. When all is said in done, IoAT empowered WSN frameworks comprises
    of various correspondence frameworks that are needed for directing, power source
    reinforcement, actuators, and sensors for communicating data associated to crop,
    and easy to understand GUI-related plans [35]. The preparing chunk comprises of
    a miniature regulator, which benefits, in legitimate and number-crunching activities,
    whose outcomes are put away in the memory. In addition, the result of the preparing
    chunk is utilized with the correspondence chunk through an outsider application
    so the rancher can settle on better choices relying on their space of attention.
    The sensor chunk encloses various kinds of sensors, for example, pH sensors, moistness
    sensors, hotness sensors; which guarantees that the information collected is solid
    and can be examined deliberately utilizing numerical calculations [36]. As a rule,
    the regular IoAT framework incorporates three significant advancements: (a) actuators
    and sensors (b) mist registering and edge figuring (c) distributed calculating
    stockpiling. These advancements are able to give applicable data to GUI related
    gadgets and it additionally intersects the diverse IoAT engineering [37]. II.
    Stage 2: Network Stage This stage manages information assortment, the board, information
    protection and security, and IoAT device management [38, 39]. Information obtaining,
    security, and the executives: Protocol and programming segments for information
    procurement are the vital attributes of this stage furthermore to safety and device-management
    purposes. This stage uses communication agents like Mosquitoes. Mosquitoes are
    proficient to execute IoT based conventions like MQTT. MQTT is a lightweight community
    IoT convention, which helps IoAT frameworks in intersecting the regulators, center
    products, switches, doors, workers, and detecting gadgets. MQTT is a generally
    utilized convention for asset and energy requirement IoAT applications [40, 41].
    In the existing times, technologies, for example, LoRaWAN has empowered long-range
    remote correspondences around the scope of 25–30 km. It needs low force and lesser
    transmission capacity for composite remote correspondences. Irrespective, it is
    a troublesome errand for LoRaWAN to pledge present multimedia coursing above inferior
    transmission capacity for uses, like climate observing [42, 43]. LoRaWAN utilizes
    IPV6 convention to speak with IoAT based frameworks. Moreover, somewhat recently,
    with the appearance of various correspondence conventions IFTTT, Z-Wave, NFC,
    Thread, RFID, SigFox, ZigBee, and interlinking of digital and actual articles
    have gotten simpler. Thread and Z-Wave are brilliant correspondence convention
    which is being utilized in shrewd houses that needs to interlink house machines,
    for example, ACs, fans, freeze, lights, dishwasher, etc. [44, 45]. NFC is a label-based
    innovation which is utilized for distinguishing different gadgets and short-range
    interchanges. NFC is able to interrelate and regulate detecting gadgets straightforwardly
    through advanced mobile phones [46]. ZigBee is a two-way correspondence convention
    that is generally utilized for uses, for example, tree directing, vector steering,
    and low-rate information interchanges [47]. III. Stage 3: Data Management Stage
    This stage manages information conveyance, handling, and capacity. It uses software
    management firmware stage-like FIWARE. FIWARE is a stage for the turn of events
    and worldwide sending of Internet utilization of the upcoming time. It gives an
    absolutely free, public, and open architecture just as a bunch of details which
    permit designers, specialist co-ops, organizations, and different associations
    to foster items [48, 49]. FIWARE COSMOS is the orientation execution of the FIWARE’s
    big data study general enabler. It is expected to convey implies for investigating
    stream and batch information [50, 51]. FIWARE ORION and FIWARE CYGNUS is an apache
    flume related center product that is liable for overseeing constant information
    stockpiling, which is generally utilized for overseeing ancient data. It primarily
    manages information assortment, information handling, and setting mindful data
    trade [48]. FIWARE ORION is a C++ execution of FIWARE stage that is competent
    to deal with the whole lifetime pattern of information the board. It incorporates
    capacities, for example, overseeing questions, routine updates and memberships.
    FIWARE QUANTUM LEAP is a component that can accumulate information as time-arrangement,
    for example, ngsi-tsdb [48]. IV. Stage 4: Irrigation and Water Distribution Methodologies
    Ordinary farming plans are required to utilize robots and soil sensors to get
    logical data identified with soil conditions. The traditional models likewise
    use calculation insight methods for quality of water administration and cloud
    computing investigation for wellbeing or execution of output based uses [19].
    These methodologies use various logical techniques and instruments to give constant
    relevant data to farming specialists [52, 53]. (a) Edge Computing: Edge figuring
    is a productive information securing method, which is generally utilized in mechanization
    related IoAT applications to give ongoing scientific calculations and notices
    identified with soil conditions, natural conditions, and landscape-related data
    [43, 45, 54]. It is a portable detecting system which gives constant checking
    of distant areas which will help rural specialists’ in settling on farmland related
    choices [55]. Somewhat recently, individual analysts have proposed different approaches
    to carry out edge and fog registering created IoAT frameworks [56]. (b) Irrigation
    Models: A water system mechanism (drip irrigation model) comprises various water
    systems (drip irrigation) techniques which are utilized by agricultural experts
    in the existing eras. The five strategies to the water system methodology are
    (i) exterior water system (ii) sprinkling water system (iii) drop water system
    (iv) sub-surface water system and (v) water system using drone. On account of
    surface water system, the water is consistently appropriated above the dirt apparent
    because of the impact of gravitational stream. Sprinkling water system looks like
    a rain style activity where water is splashed around the ranch field. Trickle
    irrigation is a methodology wherein water is conveyed as drops or little streams.
    Smart trickle water system frameworks are boon to execute for ranchers and cause
    exceptionally less initial expense. In such frameworks, because of mechanization,
    no human mediation is required which likewise brings about moderation of water
    wastage [57,58,59]. Ranchers can oversee and control such frameworks utilizing
    smartphones. On account of subsurface water system method, the water is provided
    beneath the layer of soil. The water is generally provided inside the zone of
    plant root. Drone technology helped water utilizing IoAT helped innovations, for
    example, WSNs [60,61,62]. Agribusiness explicit drone in keeping an elevated perspective
    on crop creation and assists screen with trimming development. Improving the general
    ranch proficiency, the robots likewise give an arrangement where ranchers can
    screen their yields occasionally, as indicated by their preferring. The pesticides
    are the principle obstacle drones can intercept [63, 64]. Bugs are identified,
    and various spaces of farm are gotten in practically no time. The lone concern
    drone helped water system makes is that of protection. There is no authority required
    for drones entrance, passing over somebody’s possessions using a camera and mic
    appended to it, is said as simple as possible, and could be a possible protection
    infringement. V. Stage 5: Water Use Facilities Easy-to-use GUI-related plans are
    given to ranchers and merchants to improved agreement and quicker admittance to
    water use administrations. Next, the pecking order of IoT in farming is trailed,
    the last year carries the appropriation of such developed administrations, just
    as how nicely the anticipated framework encounters client prerequisite and satisfies
    designer and client assumptions [65]. The engineers utilize the updated information
    assembled through this trial to additionally progress their IoT environment segments,
    and the clients (ranchers) who are actually occupied by such innovation on an
    everyday premise, advantage from the use of these administrations and help give
    significant client experience information towards the executed test. Because of
    energy imperatives of water quality administration detecting gadgets a solid energy
    reaping philosophy is needed to deal with the force reinforcement prerequisites.
    Be that as it may, the productive execution of energy gathering technique is as
    yet an open issue for individual analysts [32]. A productive steering convention
    is needed to oversee smooth directing of data between detecting gadgets, regulators,
    switches, entryways, and distributed computing based information stockpiling workers
    [66]. On the new occasions, it has been seen that the land is contracting slowly
    which presses the regular assets. In such situations, most recent advances can
    help ranchers in getting context-oriented data of assortment of yields for in
    the nick of time crop the board choices [66]. Besides, the factual portrayal of
    all explored information has appeared in the additional areas, which provides
    understanding of the definite directed overview of most recent IoAT related reviews
    [67, 68]. In the wake of assessing altogether the handling stages and determining
    how an IoT framework should work for explicit assignments, investigation of the
    inborn association among IoAT-related frameworks and information is addressed
    [69]. In the decision-making process, investigation is the utmost significant
    advance. All the information created through IoT gadgets is just of worth on the
    off chance that it is exposed to examination. Unlawful perceptions and significant
    ends are the things which IoAT frameworks plan to remove while carrying out an
    information examination (DA) measure. As demonstrated in Table 1, this paper has
    done the conveyance and characterization of the IoAT articles as for various classifications,
    which are explains subsequently. It additionally helps with recognizing the difficulties
    which undermine IoT scattering and open exploration issues which steers innovation
    the correct way for coming eras [70, 71]. (a) Technology: IoT is a network, which
    is implanted with innovation and can gather and trade information [71]. Like an
    environment, it connects different frameworks with the shared factor of IoT installed
    innovations and assists us with broadening IoT advancements farther than our PCs
    and cell phones. (b) Applications: Uses of this layer in such engineering have
    a tremendous window for development. IoT gadgets are probably going to be valuable
    in association amongst individuals and the gadgets nearby them [72]. Based on
    following everyday exercises of a person, to observing their rest for more proficient
    and sound living, the utilizations of IoT are boundless and consistently have
    an extent of additional development [73, 74]. (c) Challenges: The difficulties
    in the field of IoT are largely scattered. To effectively carry out IoT implementations,
    these difficulties must be managed and insignificant or totally removed [75, 76].
    From security, protection, and legitimate difficulties to challenges, which overall
    influence each of these viewpoints, are to be searched from this engineering.
    Problem related to encryption, communication compatibility, identity management,
    universal liability problems, and data possession are the significant challenges
    which are to be engaged in. (d) Business Models: Through modifications in IoT
    advances to expand usefulness and effectiveness in everyday life, plans of action
    likewise must be adjusted to match IoT assumptions [77]. For ecological development
    and upcoming improvements in the arena of accuracy farming, rural-centered enterprises
    are needed to distinguish feasible innovation-related agricultural plans that
    can give ongoing checking of harvests and give most recent soil conditions. The
    directed review distinguishes the deficiencies between the traditional horticulture
    based frameworks and developments received by farming based ventures [78]. (e)
    Future Directions: Despite the fact that anticipating the eventual fate of farming-related
    architecture is disputable, the idea of this headway is the main thrust for the
    development of the Web of Things [79, 80]. For coordination of clever items with
    this present reality, the simplicity of the cycle of advancement, expansion in
    combination among gadgets and defeating difficulties to build the attainability
    of thoughts are the great components, which must be encountered through. (f) Survey/Overview:
    Here, comprehensive definite study of IoAT technologies are discussed and presented
    in Table 1. Table 1 depicts statistical data distribution about different categories
    and sub-categories with respect to the surveyed articles and discussions. Figure
    2 signifies a graphical presentation of the quantity of papers considered for
    journal and conference papers. Similarly, Fig. 3 illustrates the dispersal of
    all the various sources based on which the study and analysis have been incorporated.

    of the previous studies of the similar research works. Fig. 4 Global scenario
    for similar research work Full size image 3 Conclusions and Future Enhancement
    Imperative agribusiness initiatives affect the advanced existing practices, methods,
    and applications. The most recent exploration discoveries additionally recommend
    that suitable utilization of accuracy based practices can make an incredible effect
    on the efficiency grade and sustainability factors [81,82,83]. This research paper
    expects to examine the various innovation-based water system frameworks (irrigation
    systems), ongoing modern practices and developments, different accuracy agribusiness-based
    stages alongside the conversation of a recently presented methodology. This paper
    discussed various contextual investigations that were likewise talked about to
    evaluate the adequacy of the inheritance frameworks[84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92].
    In this domain, maximum research were focused on regulator of several agricultural
    crops and the remote monitoring, necessities of its resource, like required level
    of water, pesticides and insecticides quantity, and fertilizers usage to ascertain
    the indices of vegetation. Notwithstanding, this paper prepared a certified endeavor
    to dissect the current techniques as well as have proposed a viable model to accomplish
    better outcomes. Though, the paper has finished a sincere effort for analyzing
    the prevailing approaches and also suggested an efficient mechanism to attain
    superior outputs. In future, a secure precision agriculture framework can be implemented
    to address IoT-related security challenges. References Shah B, Malek S (2018)

    Battery-Operated Wireless Sensor Network Chapter © 2013 1 Introduction In geotechnical
    testing technology, there is a certain distance between the test site and storage
    and other equipment, and remote data transmission needs to be considered. The
    process in which different independent devices use lines to exchange data with
    each other is called signal transmission (or data transmission), and the line
    that constitutes the entire transmission is called a network [1, 2]. At the physical
    level, a simple data transmission network includes an upper computer, a lower
    computer, a data conversion interface and a data transmission carrier, as shown
    in Fig. 1. In the geotechnical engineering test, the lower computer refers to
    the special equipment that is directly connected to the sensing device and has
    processed the analog signal into the digital signal. In order to meet the requirements
    of complex test conditions on site, a single-chip microcomputer is generally used.
    The upper computer refers to a computer that issues measurement commands and can
    receive measurement data, and it can be a personal computer, a workstation, or
    a server. Due to the different device types of the upper computer and the lower
    computer, the supported data transmission carrier may be different. With the development
    of communication technology, there are various data transmission carriers between
    the upper computer and the lower computer, such as cables (serial data transmission
    network, twisted pair network), optical fiber (optical fiber network) and wireless
    network (WIFI network, Cellular mobile network) etc. Different data transmission
    carriers require the upper computer or lower computer to convert the data into
    a signal form recognized by the carrier. This conversion device is called a data
    conversion interface. Diverse transmission carriers and interfaces bring certain
    difficulties to the construction of data transmission networks. Fig. 1. Schematic

    image 2 Application of Real-Time Safety Monitoring System for Slopes of Power
    Transmission and Transformation Facilities 2.1 Indoor Construction of Hybrid Data
    Transmission System In geotechnical engineering testing technology, the measuring
    equipment is often far away from the upper computer (such as inter-regional, inter-city,
    inter-provincial, or even cross-border distance), and the network composed of
    serial data transmission lines cannot meet the requirements of distance and anti-interference
    and the cost of self-installation is relatively high [3]. For this reason, access
    to existing mature networks (see Fig. 2), such as wireless local area network,
    Internet, mobile cellular mobile network, etc., to transmit measurement data from
    the lower computer to the upper computer, not only can extend the data transmission
    distance, but also It can enhance the anti-interference in the process of data
    transmission and avoid the cost of wiring and network. It is an economical, efficient
    and practical networking method. Fig. 2. Extended network for serial data transmission
    Full size image The hybrid data transmission system constructed in this experiment
    uses the Zigbee network to replace part of the serial data transmission line,
    and uses the WIFI wireless network for long-distance connection to the upper computer.
    The current Zigbee technology is a short-range wireless communication technology
    developed based on the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol, a wireless method with low power
    consumption. The protocol used in Zigbee network communication determines that
    it can only be used for local networks instead of long-distance transmission,
    and is used to replace some of the lines in the serial data transmission network.
    The Zigbee coordinator, router and terminal hardware devices are the same. One
    end is a serial port to connect to a serial data transmission network; the other
    end is an antenna to build or join a Zigbee network. The lower computer is connected
    to the serial port of the Zigbee router or terminal, the router or terminal is
    connected to the coordinator through the network, and the serial port of the coordinator
    is connected to the upper computer. During data transmission, when the router
    or terminal receives data on the serial data network, it immediately sends the
    data to the coordinator through the Zigbee network. When the coordinator receives
    the network data, it is immediately converted into serial data and sent to the
    upper computer; when the coordinator receives the data on the serial data network,
    it immediately sends the data to the corresponding router or terminal through
    the Zigbee network. When the router or terminal receives the data from the Zigbee
    network, it is immediately converted into serial data and sent to the lower computer.
    It is necessary to determine whether the device connected to the lower computer
    adopts a router or a terminal according to the geographical location and low-consumption
    requirements. The construction of the hybrid data transmission network involves
    the mutual conversion and networking of the serial data network and other networks.
    In order to simplify the steps of on-site construction and improve the efficiency
    of construction, the necessary wireless coordinator, DTU, and timer are integrated,
    and the serial can be connected. Data network and wireless network, the data in
    the two networks can be transformed into each other. In order to reduce power
    consumption and extend working time, the wireless timing box is equipped with
    a timing device, such as working once an hour for 2 min each time. The wireless
    timing box power supply is provided by an external solar panel. The whole box
    has only one 4-core wire connected to the lower computer, of which 2 cores are
    excitation (external) power wires, and 2 cores are signal wires. Before starting
    the measurement work, connect the power cord to the excitation power interface
    of the lower computer, and connect the signal line to the signal output interface
    of the lower computer. During the measurement process, the wireless timing box
    is turned on regularly according to the timing rules. After opening, the box converts
    the signal from the lower computer through the wireless coordinator and sends
    it to the upper computer to complete the network transmission of data. 2.2 On-site
    Construction of a Real-Time Safety Monitoring System for Slopes of Power Transmission
    and Transformation Facilities The effective grasp of the slope deformation law
    comes from the accurate analysis of high-quality monitoring data, and the rich
    monitoring data relies on a scientific and reasonable slope monitoring system.
    With the continuous development of computer and information technology, slope
    monitoring tools and methods have made rapid progress. Multi-information dynamic
    real-time monitoring technology based on wireless networks has been widely used
    in the field of slope monitoring, which greatly enriches the evolution of slopes.
    The data source provides solid data support for more scientifically and accurately
    grasping the slope deformation mechanism [4,5,6,7]. Fig. 3. Test site 110 kV Guanjia
    Line #58-#59 in Quanzhou City, Fujian Province Full size image In order to realize
    the field research of wireless real-time monitoring, this paper selects the 110kV
    Guanjia line #58-#59 in Quanzhou City, Fujian Province as the field test site
    of the real-time safety monitoring system for the slope of the power transmission
    and transformation facility, the test site is shown in Fig. 3. 110 kV Guanjia
    Line# in Quanzhou City, Fujian Province. 58-#59 has complicated geological conditions,
    and the slope here is a landfill area, which lacks effective reinforcement and
    protection measures. After reviewing the original design and carrying out the
    construction according to the original protection design plan, there is a risk
    of slope instability. In-situ monitoring of it is a very urgent task. Fig. 4.
    Sectional view of the layout of the slope safety monitoring sensor system Full
    size image The slope monitoring system adopts wireless sensor network to build
    on site, and its basic composition mainly includes three parts: sensor system,
    data acquisition and transmission system, and data management system. This experiment
    uses the slope monitoring system developed for monitoring and data collection
    for subsequent work. In order to ensure the comprehensiveness of the influencing
    factors, in addition to the conventional stress and deformation parameters, the
    sensor layout in the monitoring system is also equipped with small weather stations
    around it to measure the changes of rainfall intensity, rainfall time, wind speed,
    wind direction and other parameters in real time. The sensor system layout is
    shown in Fig. 4. The data acquisition and transmission system is shown in Fig.
    5. The basic process is that the sensor collects physical data and transmits it
    to the sensor node next to the measuring point through the data line. Each node
    transmits the data to the site base station through the on-site Zig Bee wireless
    network [8]. Then the base station uploads the data to the Internet through the
    4G mobile data network (CDMA), and finally on the server in the remote campus,
    you can log in to the client, that is, the data management system, to obtain the
    data and perform processing analysis, message sending and other follow-up work.
    Fig. 5. Physical map of monitoring device Full size image Fig. 6. Data management
    system Full size image In the data management system shown in Fig. 6, by selecting
    the query content of the cross-section, axis, measurement type and measurement
    number where the data is located, the searched monitoring results and profile
    can be obtained. In addition, data can be viewed remotely via mobile phones, which
    is faster and more convenient than traditional monitoring methods. 3 Analysis
    of Monitoring Results 3.1 Rainfall and Slope Surface Settlement In order to analyze
    the change law of the settlement of the soil mass, a soil surface settlement observation
    point is arranged on the slope top, the slope waist and the slope toe respectively.
    Combined with rainfall, the cumulative settlement-rainfall-time variation curve
    of each measuring point is drawn as shown in the Fig. 7, the time period is selected
    as 2021/2/27–2021/7/21. The overall surface settlement of the soil is closely
    related to the rainfall. The regular characteristics of body subsidence changing
    with rainfall are prominent, showing a typical stepwise growth pattern, and with
    intermittent characteristics with rainfall changes, forming two basic change components
    of short-term rapid deformation and long-term slow deformation. The measurement
    points of the slope foot and the slope waist change more obviously with the rainfall
    than the slope top measurement points. By 2021/7/21, the cumulative subsidence
    of the slope foot is 14.145 mm, the cumulative subsidence of the slope waist is
    11.298 mm, and the cumulative subsidence of the slope top is 7.513 mm. A heavy
    rainstorm occurred on June 23, 2021, the amount of settlement during rainfall
    increased sharply in a short period of time, and then stabilized; however, the
    time of settlement at the top of the slope was earlier than that of the waist
    and top of the slope. Fig. 7. Comparison of cumulative displacement curves of
    the surface of each measuring point with time Full size image Observe the settlement
    of the four foundations (A, B, C, D) of the electrical tower at the foot of the
    slope. Figure 8 is a graph of the change of the foundation settlement of the electric
    tower over time. It can be seen from the figure that the foundation settlement
    of the electric tower increases slowly with time, and the settlement of the foundation
    does not change much during the rainfall period. The reason is that the foundation
    of the electric tower itself is deeply buried, and the rock foundation is at a
    depth of 5 m on the surface, so the foundation of the electric tower is relatively
    safe. Fig. 8. Curve of electric tower foundation settlement with time Full size

    mainly selects the deep horizontal displacement of the slope soil as the research
    object to analyze the location of the sliding surface of the slope. The two displacement
    measurement points of the slope monitoring system are respectively arranged at
    the slope waist and the slope bottom, and the horizontal displacement to the downslope
    is specified as a positive value. The time period selection is the same as in
    the previous section. The test data from 2021/2/27 to 2021/7/21 are used to draw
    the cumulative displacement-depth-time variation curve inside each measuring hole
    as shown in Fig. 9. It can be seen from the figure that by July 21, 2021, the
    maximum horizontal displacement of the slope waist reached 12.2 mm, and the maximum
    horizontal displacement of the slope foot reached 3.3 mm. Due to the existence
    of electric towers at the foot of the slope, the 4 ft. of the tower have deep
    pile foundations, and the slope toe is all rocks below 5 m, and the soil at the
    foot of the slope is limited to slide, so the horizontal displacement at the foot
    of the slope is small. In addition, the horizontal displacement-depth curves of
    each measuring point have obvious inflection points, which correspond to the sliding
    surface area at their respective positions. The slope waist sliding zone is located
    in the depth range of about 6 m below the slope surface, and the slope foot sliding
    zone it is located within a depth range of about 3 m below the slope. The horizontal
    displacement value of the soil along the depth direction of the slope waist and
    the slope toe decreases continuously, and the position of the slip surface has
    a sudden change. The horizontal displacement value of the position above the slip
    surface is much larger than that of the position below it, and this situation
    continues to become prominent with the increase of time. After the rain began,
    the soil at the waist of the slope shifted horizontally toward the bottom of the
    slope. The horizontal displacement of the soil layer within 6 m depth is much
    larger than that below 6 m, that is, the depth of influence of rainfall infiltration
    is mainly within 2 m depth. At the end of the first rainfall, the horizontal displacement
    was the largest, but the surface displacement did not exceed 5 mm, which can be
    considered to be within the range of elastic deformation. The soil in the slope
    did not undergo overall plastic deformation failure after rainfall. The heavy
    rain did not cause overall instability of the soil. Fig. 9. Comparison of cumulative
    displacement curves with time for different depth positions of various measuring
    points Full size image 3.3 Soil Pressure In order to understand the distribution
    of soil pressure, two observation sections were set up at the waist and toe of
    the slope. Set 5 lateral soil pressure observation points and 5 vertical soil
    pressure observation points along the depth of 2 m, 5 m, 10 m, 15 m, and 20 m
    on the slope waist; set 2 lateral soil pressure observation points 2 vertical
    soil pressure observation points along the 2 m, 5 m depth of the slope foot. The
    distribution of vertical soil pressure is shown in Fig. 10. Figure a shows the
    change of vertical soil pressure on the slope waist with time, and figure b shows
    the change of vertical soil pressure on the foot of the slope with time. It can
    be seen from the figure that the maximum vertical soil pressure of the measured
    slope waist is 415.83 kPa, and the maximum vertical soil pressure of the slope
    toe is 103 kPa. It can also be found from the figure that the vertical soil pressure
    of the slope increases with the increase of the buried depth. Observing the lines
    in the figure, it can be found that the greater the buried depth, the greater
    the measured value of the vertical soil pressure, which is basically the same
    as the distribution law of the theoretical calculation of the soil pressure. In
    addition, the extremely heavy rain that occurred on June 23, 2021 affected the
    soil pressures at 2 m and 5 m. As the rainfall increased the bulk density of the
    soil, the soil pressure increased, and due to the presence of stagnant water at
    the foot of the slope, the earth pressure at the foot of the slope increases more
    than the slope waist. The earth pressure at 2 m after rainfall has a smaller change
    than that at 5 m, which reflects that the depth of the impact of rainfall on the
    slope is smaller. Due to the excellent drainage of the slope, the earth pressure
    quickly recovered and stabilized, so the earth pressure did not detect large fluctuations
    in the small-scale rainfall that usually occurred. Fig. 10. The distribution of
    vertical soil pressure on the slope Full size image The distribution of lateral
    soil pressure is shown in Fig. 11. Figure a shows the change of the lateral soil
    pressure on the waist of the slope with time, and Figure b shows the change of
    the lateral soil pressure on the toe of the slope with time. It can be seen from
    the figure that the measured maximum lateral soil pressure at the waist of the
    slope is 366.41 kPa, and the maximum lateral soil pressure at the toe of the slope
    is 89.88 kPa. It can also be found from the figure that the value of the lateral
    soil pressure of the slope increases with the increase of the buried depth. It
    is calculated that the average soil lateral pressure coefficient K0 of the slope
    waist is 0.68, and the average soil lateral pressure coefficient K0 of the slope
    foot is 0.67. Before rainfall, the measured stress ratios of the lateral and vertical
    soil pressure boxes were both less than 0.7. After rainfall occurs, the lateral
    earth pressure changes are similar to the vertical earth pressures. They have
    not been monitored in small-scale rainfall, and they increase after heavy rains.
    The slope toe increase is larger than the slope waist. The scope of influence
    is mainly above 5 m. Fig. 11. The distribution of lateral earth pressure on the
    slope Full size image 3.4 Pore Water Pressure Figure 12 is the curve of slope
    pore water pressure change. Figure a is the relationship curve of the pore water
    pressure at the slope waist with time, and Figure b is the relationship curve
    of the pore water pressure at the foot of the slope with time. It can be seen
    from the figure that before the start of the first rainfall, the pore water pressure
    of each depth in the soil layer is low, and the soil is almost dry. After a small
    area of rainfall, the pore water pressure changes at a depth of 2 m, and because
    the temperature and humidity of the surrounding environment are greatly affected
    by the temperature and humidity at 2 m, the pore water pressure has been continuously
    fluctuating. After the heavy rain, the pore pressures at 2 m and 5 m continued
    to increase, and positive pore water pressures were monitored, which indicated
    that a stagnant layer appeared in a short time. Due to the excellent drainage
    performance of the slope, the pore water pressure quickly stabilizes during the
    rainfall transition. Fig. 12. The distribution of pore water pressure on the slope
    Full size image 4 Result In geotechnical engineering test technology, there is
    a certain distance between the test site and equipment, and remote data transmission
    needs to be considered. For this reason, the measurement data is transmitted from
    the lower computer to the upper computer through a hybrid data transmission network,
    and a real-time monitoring system is established. The 110 kV Guanjia Line #58-#59
    in Quanzhou City, Fujian Province, is selected as the real-time safety monitoring
    system for the slope of power transmission and transformation facilities. The
    field test will be carried out at the field test site. Get the following conclusions:
    (1) Integrate wireless coordinator, DTU, and timer to connect the serial data
    network and the wireless network, and the data in the two networks can be converted
    into each other. Simplify the steps of on-site construction and improve the efficiency
    of construction. (2) The slope monitoring system is built on-site with a wireless
    sensor network, and its basic composition mainly includes three parts: a sensor
    system, data acquisition and transmission system, and a data management system.
    (3) The power transmission and transformation slope monitoring system based on
    a hybrid data transmission network measures the relationship of slope settlement,
    deep soil horizontal displacement, vertical earth pressure, lateral earth pressure,
    and pore water pressure over time. The results show that the impact of rainfall
    on the slope is limited, and the slope has excellent drainage and good stability.

  description: 'In view of the problems of effective intelligent and full coverage
    early warning technology, and the serious threat from floor water disaster when
    mining the deep coal from Gourp A in Huaihe Energy Group, the technical idea of
    guiding the prevention and control of water inrush in mining area was proposed.
    The big data intelligent early-warning cloud platform was built from the multi-source
    information based on the real-time monitoring of hydrology, water source, and
    floor failure. Based on the engineering background of the 1612A working face of
    Group A in Zhangji coal mine, the internet of things of hydrological monitoring
    data transmission system was constructed to observe the changes of water source,
    water level, water pressure, water quality, water temperature, and other parameters,
    which was used for real-time data collection, data transmission, data analysis,
    and processing. The micro-seismic monitoring internet of things was built for
    estimating failure depth of the floor. The sensor can pick up the floor failure
    signal and transmit it to the ground data signal processing terminal through the
    optical fiber ring network of the mine. The real-time monitoring and inversion
    of the floor failure, and the distribution of the water conducting fracture channel
    can be carried out. Taking various factors of mining, geology, and monitoring
    data into account, an early-warning model based on neural network and in-depth
    learning was established. The main control index and evaluation index of coal
    mine safety evaluation were determined, and machine learning training was carried
    out for the model by collecting a large amount mine data nationwide. A big data
    early-warning cloud platform system for water inrush disaster from coal mine floor
    was established, and the system integrates five modules: data collection, management
    configuration, equipment monitoring, central control panel, multi-dimensional
    analysis, and fault early warning. The seamless connection was realized by network
    integration and data integration technologies. The learned early-warning model
    was embedded in the system. Based on the integrated multi-source data, the risk
    assessment and early warning of water inrush from the mine floor were carried
    out, and the decision-making information was released in real time through mutual
    feed analysis with micro-seismic data. At last, five groups of data of coal mines
    in Huainan and other mining areas were selected to verify the model. The evaluation
    and analysis were carried out in the 1612A working face. The results show that
    the calculation and prediction results of chosen mines were reasonable, and the
    probability of water inrush disaster in the Zhangji coal mine was small. There
    was no early warning information in the monitoring period, which confirmed the
    feasibility of the application of big data cloud platform in the prevention and
    control of coal mine floor water disaster. It provides a new technical support
    for monitoring and early warning of mine floor water disaster in mining deep coal
    in Huaihe Energy Group.'

  description: As part of the National Disaster Management Research Institute’s Official
    Development Assistance (ODA) projects for transferring new technologies in the
    field of disaster-safety management, a flood forecasting and warning system was
    established in 2019 targeting the Borikhan in the Namxan River Basin in Bolikhamxai
    Province, Laos. In the target area, which is an ungauged small and medium river
    basin, observation stations for real-time monitoring of rainfall and runoff and
    alarm stations were installed, and a software that performs real-time data management
    and flood forecasting and warning functions was also developed. In order to establish
    a flood warning standard and develop a nomograph for flood prediction, hydraulic
    and hydrological analysis was performed based on the 30-year annual maximum daily
    rainfall data and river morphology survey results in the target area. This paper
    introduces the process and methodology used in this study, and presents the results
    of the system’s applicability review based on the data observed and collected
    in 2020 after system installation.

    I. Introduction Climate change and water pollution due to urban, agricultural
    and industrial developments have impacted inland water bodies worldwide. Today,
    one of the most worrying troubles are harmful algae blooms (HAB) [1], which is
    a persistent problem induced by rising temperatures and overabundance of key nutrients,
    such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) [2], [3]. Algae proliferation on surface
    water triggers poor transparency, which affects the trophic chain by preventing
    benthic photosynthetic organisms from developing. Besides, damage to the ecosystem
    increases when bloom collapses and dies as the excessive consumption of dissolved
    oxygen by bacterial decomposers may result in aquatic animal death by asphyxia.
    The HAB dominated by cyanobacteria are a particular concern. These microorganisms
    are photosynthetic bacteria, also known as blue-green algae, and many of the most
    frequent species can produce toxins that are highly poisonous for animals and
    human beings [4]. When a toxic HAB appears, the authorities must set up exhaustive
    vigilance programmes and restrict water uses [5]. Consequently, affected areas
    often suffer vast economic losses in public health, fisheries, tourism and water
    management terms, which range from hundreds to billions of dollars, according
    to evaluations made in Europe, North America and Australia [6], [7]. Toxic cyanobacterial
    blooms are widespread in water bodies worldwide [8]. In Spain, about 35-48% of
    reservoirs are impacted by cyanobacterial blooms [9]. For instance, the As Conchas
    reservoir, located in the “Baixa Limia-Serra do Xurés” Natural Park (The Miño-Sil
    River Basin District in Galicia, NW Spain), undergoes intense eutrophication.
    Public reports by the Spanish Ministry have shown that the worse water quality
    in the As Conchas reservoir is due to not only poor sewage water purification
    at the head of the Limia River, but also to very diffuse agro-livestock contamination
    on the Limia plain. Consequently, the cyanobacterial concentration has nearly
    exceeded alert level 2 according to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines
    [5], which implies several cuts in the water supply to the population and restricting
    recreational activities in aquatic areas. Likewise, the shallow L’Albufera Lagoon
    in Valencia (E Spain) is a characteristic wetland of Mediterranean coastal environments
    that is also impacted by HABs. Human activities exert significant pressures on
    this lagoon as most incoming water is traditionally regulated by rice cultivation
    requirements and leftover sewage water discharges [10]. The occurrence of cyanobacteria
    at the shallow L’Albufera Lagoon follows a spatial-temporal pattern related to
    seasonality and strong anthropic pressure, which make it a highly eutrophic lagoon
    whose recovery to an optimal state is difficult [11]. For decades, water management
    agencies have made many efforts to track HAB dynamics by manual water sampling
    [12]. However, their variable distribution over space and time requires monitoring
    with a very fine spatial-temporal resolution, which limits manual long-term monitoring
    techniques because they are time-consuming and expensive to analyse in a laboratory
    [13]. As an alternative or auxiliary technology, remote monitoring techniques
    based on the Internet of Things (IoT) have emerged to provide continuous (real-time)
    and autonomous surveillance. These second-generation systems employ advanced sensors
    that allow the detection of key parameters related to HAB; e.g. photosynthetic
    pigments, nutrients load, pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, electric conductivity,
    etc. [13]. Current advances in wireless communications permit sensors to communicate
    with one and other and with users, which helps to make decisions supported by
    realtime data [14], [15]. Accordingly, IoT-based solutions have led to more studies
    that use nodes deployed in situ [16], [17] and sensors aboard satellites [18],
    [19] for the spatial-temporal monitoring of HABs in freshwater, brackish water
    and marine environments [20]–[22]. Modern monitoring programmes are beginning
    to include these technologies worldwide [23]–[25], and some initiatives propose
    using the big data collected to develop algorithms to foresee HABs in any lake
    on the earth [16], [26]. However, these emerging tools are in their very early
    development stage and some relevant issues still constrain their applicability
    by many water management agencies. For instance, there is no standard method or
    decision protocol to choose the right monitoring system architecture depending
    on the intrinsic characteristics of environments (salinity, size, depth, hydrodynamics,
    anthropogenic pressure, etc.). Because of this, many Remote Monitoring System
    (RMS) architectures are chosen for price, technical knowledge for handling or
    the availability of the sensing parameters offered by manufacturers. Instead they
    overlook the fact that the reliability and representativeness of the collected
    data may vary according to the number of nodes deployed per area, the selected
    parameters to be measured, the surroundings and depths where sensors are placed,
    among others [27]–[29]. This, together with the many studies that collect the
    data by developing their own nodes [17], [30], [31], makes comparisons between
    monitoring systems difficult and, therefore, big data collection may be rendered
    ineffective for HABs estimations. In this study we implement an RMS based on IoT
    technologies which, combined with satellite imagery, track HAB in two Spanish
    water bodies with different characteristics: the freshwater As Conchas Reservoir
    (Galicia) and the brackish water shallow L’Albufera Lagoon (Valencia). Readers
    will find herein the RMS architecture selection for nodes and their deployment
    in situ, the satellite images acquisition system and the development of a multiplatform
    web application for on-line data visualisation. Based on this, the aim of this
    paper is twofold: to firstly provide critical and empirical data based on market
    availabilities to replicate a continuous, realtime and remote monitoring platform
    in other HAB-affected areas; to secondly, test whether the same RMS architecture
    is adequate for monitoring different environments. To this end, we analyse the
    correlation of the data collected by the different nodes deployed in various areas
    of the water body and their variation depending on the measured parameter and
    monitored environment. Therefore, this study provides relevant information for
    water management agencies to choose the right monitoring system architecture,
    and thus paves the path to effective big data collection based on the IoT. SECTION
    II. System Architecture and Implementation Briefly, an RMS can be defined as a
    set of nodes with sensing and computing capabilities that allow data transfer
    to a central server, usually via wireless communication. This technology has its
    limitations, such as its inability to control the environment or other restrictions
    related to topological, power use and computing capabilities [32]. For continuous
    water monitoring, nodes must be installed on a floating platform or buoy (Fig.
    1), withstand adverse environmental conditions (resist water, sun exposure, robustness
    against wind and waves, wildlife impact), be energetically autonomous and have
    enough communication coverage for data transfer. They must also be scalable and
    adaptable to the requirements (size, volume, depth, etc.) present at different
    locations. Gradual system deterioration caused by natural fouling or possible
    acts of vandalism must also be considered. Nonetheless, when the deployed RMS
    possesses the aforementioned characteristics, big data are collected with minimal
    human intervention, which provides a cost-effective solution for diverse IoT-based
    environmental monitoring applications. Fig. 1. (a) Structure of a smart buoy:
    Solar panel, node based on Libelium technologies, sensors and buoy. (b) Block
    diagram of a node showing the interconnection among Sensors, Data Acquisition
    Board, Main Board and Wireless Transceiver Device (4G). Main Board includes a
    Microcontroller Unit (MCU), Real Time Clock (RTC), SD Card for data saving and
    a Power Manager for controlling energy suppliers. Show All Multispectral satellite
    images also enable water bodies to be monitored by measuring reflectance of water
    at different wavelengths and delivering data about environmental colours [33].
    The colour of bloom-forming algae and cyanobacteria depends on the pigments they
    contain and their absorption or reflectance at different wavelengths [34]. For
    instance, Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), the most dominant pigment in algae, is strongly
    reflected on the green spectrum, which the human eye captures as green. Otherwise,
    cyanobacteria also produce Phycocyanin (Phy), which reflects more intensely on
    the cyan and green spectrum and appears as a variation in blue or turquoise [35].
    By processing this type of images, different indices can be calculated as specific
    indicators, which is extremely useful for detecting various types of HAB. To date,
    several indices have been applied, such as the Harmful Algae Bloom Index (HABi),
    developed by the company EOMAP (Earth Observation and Environmental Services),
    which specialises in detecting blue algae containing Phy pigments; the Red-Tide
    Index (RI), which tracks the reflectance of Carotenoid pigments [19]. Satellite-based
    remote sensing can offer daily/weekly temporal and large spatial resolution and,
    thus, supplement the RMS deployed in situ (Fig. 2). However, interferences with
    cloud cover and low light penetration in the water column may limit HAB monitoring
    by this technology [36]. Fig. 2. RMS architecture. Big Data collection by the
    nodes deployed in situ, images acquired by on-board satellite sensors, and subsequent
    data management in the cloud. Show All Finally, given the need to gain ubiquitous
    access to the collected data, a data management system is required as an integral
    part of the IoT-based solution (Fig. 2). This could involve software that allows
    the received data to be collected and stored in a database and a web interface
    for data viewing and post-processing purposes. For a HAB monitoring platform,
    it is advisable that the RMS system exhibits a modular design to manage several
    databases from different locations and to access them simultaneously from distinct
    devices [24]. It would also be desirable for the system to allow the database
    to be replicated in several remote servers by adding backup capabilities to the
    system and allowing remote collaboration between different users and sites. A.
    Node Alternatives Modern devices for HAB monitoring are normally divided into
    physical and chemical sensors [32]. The number of measurable parameters often
    depends on the available ports at each node, the load capacity of a buoy, as well
    as other restrictions; e.g. costs or suitability of commercially available sensor
    devices (range, accuracy, resolution, etc). Optical sensors, also called fluorometers,
    of Chl-a and Phy are normally mandatory because they allow the monitoring of algae
    and cyanobacteria as these photosynthetic pigments are frequently considered to
    be a proxy of phytoplankton biomass [37]. Likewise, optical turbidity sensors
    are commonplace for environmental water quality monitoring as they reflect content
    substances in water, including pigments, suspended organic matter, microorganisms,
    etc. [38]. Optical sensors exhibit a high-accuracy and low-calibration drift,
    but at a high cost. One major drawback is that they acquire information from their
    close surroundings, which means that the deployment area must be correctly selected.
    Instead their use is significant when combined with satellite images. Indirect
    parameters come into play for monitoring HAB outbreaks at a lower cost than optical
    sensors, but at higher calibration frequencies and replacement rates. A temperature
    sensor is widely used because temperature has an strong effect on HAB dynamics
    and distribution [39]. Even intense light absorption by photosynthetic microorganisms
    can locally increase water temperature [40]. This is a thermistor and many commercial
    brands offer this sensor combined with electrodes to detect the electrical conductivity
    of water. The latter can be an interesting incorporation because electrical conductivity
    is related to rainfall and flushing events, and can be associated with certain
    toxic species [41]. The pH sensor, mostly measured by ion-selective glass combined
    electrodes, is also commonplace because it is responsive to changes in photosynthetic
    activity as a consequence of phytoplankton growth [42]. Another sensor capable
    of measuring microbial activity is the Oxydo Reduction Potential (ORP) sensing
    electrode [43]. This sensor is a platinum electrode whose potential is to read
    the sample oxidation, which may indicate algae decomposition [44]. Other widely
    employed electrochemical sensors for water quality analyses are those based on
    ion-selective electrode (ISE) membranes. They are cost-effective, but are subject
    to poor stability and a short lifespan due to fouling [45]. ISE membranes-based
    sensors have been developed for dissolved oxygen detection, which is a critical
    component of any healthy aquatic system [46], but modern optical options are also
    available. ISE membrane-based sensors can also measure essential nutrients for
    HABs promotions, such as nitrate (N-source) and orthophosphate (P-source). However,
    inherited problems of ISE membrane technologies and further limitations in other
    commercial alternatives, such as using chemical reagents-based sensors for orthophosphate
    detection [47], can restrict their use for long-term monitoring. Once sensors
    measure water samples, collected data must be stored in a datalogger and sent
    to the data management system by wireless communication. Today’s wireless communication
    technologies market offers several suitable alternatives, such as ZigBee, GSM,
    GPRS, Bluetooth, Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRa) and SigFox. They differ in
    frequency bands, data rate, range capability, network topology and energy use
    term [14], and the most appropriate technology depends on each specific location,
    requirement and application. Of all the different available commercial node alternatives
    on the market, multiparametric probes from the YSI, Hydrolab or Manta+ manufacturers
    are some of the most extended. These commercial systems can be implemented using
    fully functional proprietary solutions (plug-and-play), but also involve a high
    cost and very few customisation options. Alternatively, customisable commercial
    solutions, such as Libelium Waspmote [48], have appeared to offer ad-hoc solutions
    with open software. Differences in costs between plug-and-play and customisable
    nodes are not negligible as they are around 10-fold lower with Libelium Waspmote.
    Conversely, although the variety of sensing parameters in Libelium Waspmote is
    miscellaneous, they do not currently offer optical sensors for Chl-a and Phy detection,
    but multiparametric probes do. Notwithstanding, the set of available IoT-based
    options in Libelium is still growing, as shown by recent hybrid alternatives that
    combine custom-made dataloggers with multiparametric probes. B. Node Selection
    and Deployment In this study we select a combination of plug-and-play and customisable
    technologies for the RMS architecture implemented in the As Conchas reservoir
    and the shallow L’Albufera Lagoon. Tables I and II show the selected technologies
    and the available information for the characteristics of the sensors procured.
    Early in 2020, two multiparametric probes based on YSI technologies, two customised
    nodes based-on Libelium Waspmote and one Libelium weather station were deployed
    in each water body (Fig. 3). The system was set up to take measurements every
    15 min, and a periodic maintenance of the installed sensors was carried out following
    the manufacturer’s recommendations for cleaning, calibration and replacement rates.

    Fig. 3. Deployment of buoys containing nodes in (1) As Conchas Reservoir (Galicia,
    Spain) and (2) L’Albufera shallow lagoon (Valencia, Spain). Show All The As Conchas
    reservoir roughly contains 80 Hm3 and its depth varies between 15 m and 32 m in
    central reservoir areas. YSI multiparametric probes were deployed in the area
    using two commercial EM1250 buoys (Xylem Analytics) (Fig. 4a), while Libelium
    Waspmotes were deployed by two custom-made buoys (Fig. 4b). Buoys were anchored
    to the bottom at fixed coordinates in different reservoir areas (Fig. 3) and annual
    swings ranging from 10 m to 11 m were considered. The shallow L’Albufera Lagoon
    has a minimal volume of 17.2 Hm3 and a maximum one of 27 Hm3 depending on water
    volume contributions, and its average depth is 0.9 m [11]. Given its shallow depth,
    all the nodes were deployed using custom-made buoys (Fig. 4b) to avoid sensors
    coming close to sediment after considering minimal swings. The weather stations
    were installed in dam facilities and park management agencies’ facilities (Fig.
    3), respectively. Fig. 4. (a) Plug-and-play buoy containing YSI multiparametric

    All C. Satellite Image Acquisition System Sentinel-2 is an Earth Observation mission
    that comprises a constellation of two twin satellites, Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B,
    from European Space Agency’s (ESA) Copernicus Programme. This is oriented to provide
    surface reflectance images in 13 spectral channels from 443 nm to 2190 nm (central
    wavelength) with the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP). The mission’s novel
    imager can capture water quality parameters, such as the surface concentration
    of chlorophylls, water turbidity (or water clarity) and environmental levels of
    health and pollution [36]. Sentinel-2 optical imagery is used in this work for
    the systematic revisits made over the same area in inland water bodies at a high
    spatial resolution (10 m to 60 m). The selected images were calibrated by the
    C2RCC semi-analytical algorithm for atmospheric correction. This algorithm possesses
    a set of tools capable of reducing the atmospheric path radiance required to estimate
    the Chl-a concentration from the Sentinel-2 satellite images [49]. D. Data Management
    System The data management system is based on a software that collects and stores
    big data from nodes in a database in real-time. It consists of a web interface
    with different modules, including data management functions (Fig. 2). The system
    was developed with the Spring Source Platform through the MVC (Model-View-Controller)
    architecture pattern. Programming was developed in Java using: Spring Security
    modules to provide the server with security; Spring Data for simplified data access;
    and Spring Boot as a development framework combined with Maven and Thymeleaf as
    a template engine for HTML5, CSS and JavaScript files, which form the web application
    design (front-end). Data persistence was guaranteed with JPA and Hibernate, which
    allow to interact with the database. The TCP/IP protocol was employed to receive
    the binary communication frames from each deployed sensing node. An external database
    server was also implemented. MySQL Server 5.7.29 was used as a server in an Ubuntu
    18.04 LTS (Long Time Service) machine. A Python code was developed to introduce
    the data saved before the platform was launched into the database. Formats JSON
    and CSV were used by administrators and customers to download the data from the
    database. In fact, access to database content was secured with HTTPS and secure
    authentication. Different user profiles were defined: Administrator, with full
    access to all the data and permission to manage user profiles; Customers, with
    full access to data and some configuration options for a specific location; the
    public profile, which was able to access open information, but not to download
    data. This monitoring platform was installed at the IMDEA Water Institute facilities
    and data can be consulted on the website: http://www.cianomod.es. Spanish was
    used as the native language as this system attempts to meet the needs of water
    bodies in Spanish regions. SECTION III. System Test The monitoring website allows
    access to geolocated data online with a latency to transmit the data from sensors
    to the server of 45 ± 6 sec. After 6 months of implementing the same RMS architecture
    at each water body, different outcomes were attained. All the nodes ran well at
    the As Conchas reservoir, while those deployed at the shallow L’Albufera Lagoon
    considerably deteriorated, particularly the nodes belonging to Libelium technologies.
    Likewise, the lifespan of the ISE membranes-based sensors installed on the YSI
    multiparametric probes (i.e. nitrate sensor) was significantly shorter in the
    L’Albufera Lagoon than in the As Conchas reservoir. The most adverse conditions
    at the L’Albufera Lagoon, such as the proximity of sensors to sediment, hypereutrophic
    water, penetrating fouling, higher salinity, etc., may explain the worse response
    of some sensors in that environment. In order to know whether the measurements
    of each parameter varied depending on the monitored area per water body, a Pearson
    correlation test was performed by using the big data collected from March to September
    2020. To reduce correlation errors due to spurious measurement peaks or missing
    data, data were filtered by a median every 2 h (for every 8 data). Given the inconsistency
    of the collected data for nitrate in both water bodies, and the erratic data of
    buoy L5 at the L’Albufera Lagoon (Fig. 3), they were not considered for this assessment.
    The results showed that the correlations among nodes differed depending on both
    parameters and monitored environment. For instance, temperature sensor measurements
    were highly correlated between nodes in both water bodies, and the same occurred
    between pH sensors (Tables S1 and S2). In contrast, the correlation of the electric
    conductivity data was very low to moderate in the As Conchas reservoir, but it
    was highly correlated at the L’Albufera Lagoon (Tables S1 and S2). These differences
    could be due to the variation in depths and wide swings in volume that the As
    Conchas reservoir presents, which causes variable proximity of some sensors to
    sediment, while the characteristics of the shallow L’Albufera Lagoon led to more
    homogeneous changes in electric conductivity among nodes. The correlation outcomes
    between optical sensors were also diverse. The Chl-a measurements were highly
    correlated between nodes in As Conchas, but poorly correlated at L’Albufera (Fig.
    5). Similar results were observed for the Phy data in both environments (Fig.
    5). Altogether, these results suggest that the representativeness of the collected
    data was subjected to the parameter type and water body’s heterogeneity and, therefore,
    we agree with other studies which highlighted that not all RMS architectures would
    be effective for monitoring any water body [29]. Fig. 5. Scatter plot showing
    the Pearson correlation between the YSI multiparamteric probes measurements in
    the As Conchas reservoir (left plots) and the shallow L’Albufera Lagoon (right
    plots) for Chl-a (upper plots) and Phy (botton plots) concentration. Show All
    To verify the previous observation, an assessment of the distribution of the algae
    bloom over space and time was performed by satellite imagery. To do so, 44 Sentinel-2
    images were processed to produce detailed maps of the Chl-a concentrations in
    both water bodies (Fig. 6). In each image, 9 pixels data of 20 m were taken from
    around the coordinates of each deployed node. As far as our data show, Chl-a accumulated
    in patches in different areas of the water bodies (Fig. 6). This is particularly
    relevant for the L’Albufera Lagoon, where the largest differences in Chl-a concentrations
    were recorded. Fig. 6. The Chl-a concentration ( μg⋅ L −1 ) derived from Sentinel-2
    satellite images using the C2RCC algorithm. Left: the As Conchas Reservoir (Galicia,
    Spain); right: the shallow L’Albufera Lagoon (Valencia, Spain). Show All In order
    to validate these estimations, the satellite imagery data were compared to the
    optical measurements taken by in situ nodes. The results showed that satellite
    estimations correlated moderately with the nodes in both environments (Fig. 7,
    Tables S3 and S4). In the As Conchas reservoir, a mean difference of 0.6μg⋅ L
    −1 , with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) from ∼0.1μg⋅ L −1 to 27, 6μg⋅ L −1 ,
    was obtained for the entire Chl-a concentrations range. At the L’Albufera Lagoon,
    it was 20.7μg⋅ L −1 , with RMSE going from ∼0.1μg⋅ L −1 to 89.4μg⋅ L −1 . These
    results show that, as the Chl-a concentration increased, the differences between
    the values measured in situ and those deriving from the satellite images were
    bigger. One reason for this could be that when dealing with turbid waters, the
    C2RCC algorithm does not properly adjust due to high suspended sediment loads
    [50]. Therefore, larger data sets are needed to better adjust the calibration
    parameters in the C2RCC processing algorithm [51], [52] and, thus, unequivocally
    confirm the satellite estimations. Fig. 7. Scatter plot showing the correlation
    between the Chl-a concentrations measured in situ with buoys and those deriving
    from the C2RCC algorithm satellite images in the As Conchas reservoir (left plot)
    and the L’Albufera Lagoon (right plot). Show All Overall, these results support
    previous observations [27], [29] and point out that the more heterogeneous the
    environment is, the more nodes must be deployed in different areas and for longer
    time to obtain a realistic view of the water body status. As the optical sensors
    onboard of plug-and-play technologies are expensive, but essential for HAB growth
    estimations, the deployment of RMS by combining plug-and-play and customisable
    technologies could allow more sampling points at a lower cost. Thereby, the development
    of models based on variables of homogeneous distribution measured from many areas,
    combined with a few deployed optical sensors for algae quantification, could be
    an alternative to foresee HABs in a cost-effective manner. Likewise, combining
    the nodes deployed in situ with satellite imagery for data validation purposes
    could provide a robust and effective monitoring system architecture for many water
    management agencies to track HABs in inland water. SECTION IV. Conclusion The
    RMS allowed big data collection from two different environments, data transfer
    to a data management system on the cloud and their subsequent visualisation on
    the web interface in real time. The Pearson correlation tests suggested that the
    multiple nodes deployed in different areas are necessary to obtain a realistic
    view of the water body status. This could be particularly important for monitoring
    HABs in heterogenic water bodies with high anthropogenic pressure, where algae
    biomass could accumulate in patches that difficult to track by single nodes. If
    the high prices of nodes limit this approach, a combination of plug-and-play (e.g.
    YSI) and customisable (e.g. Libelium Waspmote) technologies could be a cost-effective
    solution. Satellite imagery could allow the suitability of deployed RMS architecture
    to be validated by analysing the spatial-temporal distribution of the algae bloom
    in such an environment. Therefore, this study provides critical and empirical
    data for water management agencies to implement a profitable and effective monitoring
    system to track HAB in inland water bodies. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors thank A.

    Location: Chongqing, China SECTION I. Introduction The environment-friendly Internet
    of things is the generally divided into four logical levels: perception interaction
    layer, network transmission layer, service support layer and intelligent application
    layer, as shown in the figure below. The perception interaction layer is mainly
    responsible for collecting various environmental protection related data and monitoring
    environmental protection related elements and related equipment. The data collected
    by the perception interaction layer includes basic information data, business
    data, real-time monitoring data and other relevant data. All kinds of sensitive
    and heterogeneous data are the collected through unified data specifications and
    security protection protocols. According to the data source location and data
    nature of the perception interaction layer, the network transmission layer transmits
    massive data quickly, reliably and safely through the internal data interface
    and external data interface, as well as the corresponding internal and external
    networks. The service support layer cloud stores the massive data of the network
    transport layer and provides cloud been computing services, providing efficient
    service support for various application entities in the smart application layer.
    The smart application layer performs targeted analysis, application and management
    of environmental data on the service support layer. In the overall logical architecture
    of the environment-friendly Internet of things, security protection and standards
    run through four levels: perception and interaction, network transmission, service
    support and intelligent application, providing all-round security protection and
    expansion support for the environment-friendly Internet of things.[1] SECTION
    II. Overall Network Network Figure 1: Network architecture diagram of environmental
    protection Internet of things. Show All The overall network architecture of the
    environment-friendly Internet of things is the shown in Figure 1 below. The sensor
    nodes deployed in each monitoring object are connected to the Internet through
    various network access methods (including industrial bus, wireless ad hoc network,
    GPRS gateway, TD-SCDMA gateway, etc.), and the remote sensing information such
    as satellite remote sensing and aircraft remote sensing is connected to the internal
    network through a special data channel. Necessary security isolation shall been
    conducted directly through the firewall on the Internet and inside and outside
    to ensure the security of sensitive data. The internal data related to environmental
    protection are been shared in the space network for environmental protection.
    At the same time, data channels are established at the three levels of District,
    county, municipal and national monitoring and supervision to ensure the smooth
    and safe upload and release of data [2]–[3]. SECTION III. Research Direction After
    the development of buoy type multi parameter automatic water quality monitoring
    equipment, the following requirements shall been met: monitoring parameters: water
    temperature, pH value, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, turbidity and redox potential.
    The automatic monitoring system uses the buoy as the carrier, and the sensor is
    in direct contact with the water body, which can float with the rise and fall
    of the water level, so as the realize 24-hour continuous monitoring, and avoid
    the damage of the sensor due to long-term dehydration. Solar power supply is adopted
    to realize low power consumption and long-time operation; the economy of system
    operation and low system operation cost; Data acquisition, processing and transmission
    are integrated, and the structure is simple; the system has self-cleaning function
    and convenient installation and maintenance [4]. SECTION IV. Parameter Selection
    The most commonly used water quality parameters are a selected, the equipment
    cost is relatively low, and can effectively reflect the water quality qualitatively
    or quantitatively to a certain extent [5]–[6] Water temperature: the physical
    and chemical properties of water are closely been related to the water temperature.
    The solubility of dissolved gases in water (such as oxygen and carbon dioxide),
    biological and microbial activities in water, non-ionic ammonia, salinity, pH
    value and other solutes are affected by the change of water temperature. Turbidity:
    it is be caused by suspended substances such as sediment, clay, organic matter,
    inorganic matter, plankton and microorganisms in the water, which is not only
    slow but also difficult to deposit. Turbidity caused by hydroxides of iron and
    manganese in daily life is very harmful and must been removed by special methods.
    Natural water can become clear after coagulation, sedimentation and filtration.
    PH value: refers to the negative logarithm of hydrogen ion activity in water,
    pH = -lgα H+, the pH value of natural water is mostly in the range of 6 ~ 9, which
    is also the pH value control range in China’s sewage discharge standards. PH value
    is not only closely related to the solubility, chemical form, characteristics,
    behavior and effect of dissolved substances in water, but also has an important
    impact on the life activities of aquatic organisms. Conductivity: conductivity
    is the ability of a solution to conduct current in numbers. The conductivity of
    pure water is very small. When the water contains inorganic acid, alkali or salt,
    the conductivity increases, conductivity is often be used indirectly infer the
    total concentration of ionic components in water. The conductivity of an aqueous
    solution depends on the properties and concentration of ions, the temperature
    and viscosity of the solution, etc. The conductivity changes with temperature.
    When the temperature increases by 1°C, the conductivity increases by about 2%,
    generally, 25°C is be specified as the standard temperature for measuring conductivity.
    Dissolved oxygen: the dissolved oxygen content of natural water depends on the
    oxygen balance between the water body and the atmosphere. The saturation content
    of dissolved oxygen is a closely related to the partial pressure of oxygen in
    the air, atmospheric pressure and water temperature. Dissolved oxygen in clean
    surface water is generally close to saturation. Due to the growth of algae, dissolved
    oxygen may be supersaturated. When the water body is been polluted by organic
    and inorganic reducing substances, the dissolved oxygen decreases. When the oxygen
    in the atmosphere is too late to supplement, the dissolved oxygen in the water
    gradually decreases and even approaches zero. At this time, anaerobic bacteria
    reproduce and the water quality deteriorates, resulting in the death of fish and
    shrimp. The content of dissolved oxygen in wastewater depends on the treatment
    process before wastewater discharge. Generally, the content is low and varies
    greatly. Fish fatalities are the mostly caused by a large amount of sewage, which
    increases the amount of oxygen consuming substances in the water, and the dissolved
    oxygen is very low, resulting in suffocation and death of fish. Therefore, dissolved
    oxygen is one of the important indicators to evaluate water quality. Redox potential:
    for a water body, there are often multiple redox pairs, which are the very complex
    system, and its redox potential is the comprehensive result of redox of multiple
    oxidizing substances and reducing substances. Redox potential is of great significance
    to the migration and transformation of pollutants in water environment. The type,
    rate and balance of oxidation in water determine the properties of main solutes
    in water to the great extent. SECTION V. Key Module Design A. Data transmission
    mode of buoy monitoring point Figure 2: Network architecture. Show All The buoy
    monitoring point of the environmental protection Internet of things monitoring
    system collects on-site water quality data, and the data is a transmitted to the
    database of the environmental protection information center through GPRS. The
    smart city platform grabs the data from the database for data display. The system
    architecture is been shown in Figure 2. B. Structural design of buoy monitoring
    points The buoy monitoring point design structure of the environmental protection
    Internet of things monitoring system is the shown in Figure 3. From top to bottom:
    antenna, night navigation warning light, GPS receiver, controller (including reserve
    power supply, data acquisition, equipment control and GPRS communication), solar
    panel, floating body and multi parameter sensor. Figure 3: structure of buoy monitoring
    points. Show All C. Design of data acquisition unit The main function of the data
    acquisition unit is to collect real-time data from sensors and an unattended data
    acquisition system integrating data acquisition, storage, transmission and management.
    It is suitable for use in industries with harsh environment. D. Power supply system
    design The system is a powered by solar energy, which is mainly composed of a
    solar cell module, solar controller, battery and support. In the solar power supply
    system, the photovoltaic module converts light energy into electric energy, which
    can used by the load directly or after inversion. The excess electric energy will
    be stored in the battery for the load to use without light. Considering that Chongqing
    is located in the southwest, it is foggy all year round and the average annual
    sunshine hours are low; Especially in winter, it is normal to have more than 10
    consecutive cloudy and rainy days. The system adopts intelligent self been power
    supply control system. The data collector collects the power of the battery in
    real time, and automatically adjusts the data sampling frequency according to
    the power of the battery and the time be period. In the process of practical application,
    the power supply scheme can adjusted according to the actual situation, and the
    specific adjustment scheme can be set remotely through GPRS. SECTION VI. Automatic
    water quality monitoring system The purpose of this system is to transmit the
    monitoring data of automatic water quality monitoring buoy to the monitoring center
    server in real time. The system uses wireless communication to collect instrument
    data. The central server is equipped with receiving platform and communication
    software to centrally process instrument data. It has the functions of displaying
    real-time data, querying historical data, exceeding standard alarm and so on [7],
    [8]. The water quality monitoring system is been built based on wireless communication
    network. The system design includes three parts: field data acquisition and transmission
    instrument, monitoring substation and monitoring center. The system architecture
    is Figure 4 follows: Figure 4: System architecture. Show All The system consists
    of water quality analyzer, buoy body, acquisition system, communication module
    and monitoring platform. The monitoring parameters of the system include temperature,
    pH, DO, conductivity, turbidity, etc. According to the requirements of the project,
    the system collects and transmits water quality monitoring data in the monitoring
    water area. Float monitoring points and fixed monitoring points been used to detect
    water quality mainly through five-parameter analyzer. After acquiring the monitoring
    data, the data acquisition and transmission instrument sends the data to the monitoring
    substation and monitoring center through the wireless communication module, it
    can receive and respond to the anti-control command information sent by the monitoring
    sub-station and the monitoring center. The monitoring center collects and applies
    the data of all monitoring points. When the monitoring center is been connected
    to the Internet network, the server data communication software of the monitoring
    center communicates with the data acquisition and transmission instruments of
    all monitoring points. Realize the collection of monitoring parameter data and
    the sending of anti-control command. The monitoring center uses the database to
    store and back up the original data to ensure the traceability of the data; In
    addition, the monitoring center service software provides data interface to share
    application data. The project requires that the instrument data of the buoy point
    is been uploaded, and the special data acquisition and transmission instrument
    is used to automatically collect various signals from the automatic analysis of
    water quality. The data acquisition and transmission instrument has 4-20mA analog
    signal interface and RS232 or RS485 communication interface, which can collect
    data in various forms. The data acquisition and transmission instrument that collects
    the data transmits the signal to the monitoring platform through wireless transmission,
    which is been analyzed and processed by the monitoring platform software. The
    system communication architecture is been shown in Figure 5 below: Figure 5: System
    communication architecture. Show All According to the requirements of data integration
    in this paper, combined with the working methodology formed by environmental protection
    data sorting and integration, the design idea of this paper is be obtained, as
    shown in Figure 7 below: Figure 6: Schematic diagram of data integration ideas
    Show All The data integration work a plan consists of three main tasks: business
    system and data analysis, data integration initialization and incremental data
    collection. At the same time, safety, quality, compliance and archiving should
    be the considered in the whole process of data integration. SECTION VII. Conclusions
    The design of this pollution source monitoring system based on the Internet of
    things is to enhance the supervision means, improve the environmental management
    capacity and environmental supervision efficiency, strengthen environmental law
    enforcement and promote environmental risk prevention. The second is to improve
    the utilization efficiency of Internet of things data, form a socialized environmental
    safety supervision system through public participation, and further promote the
    openness and transparency of monitoring data. Three breakthroughs have are made
    in the current environmental protection Internet of things. First is to break
    through the key technology of wide distribution of environmental Internet of things.
    the second is to break through the key technology of dynamic perception of governance
    and monitoring equipment status, and the third is to break through the key technology
    of multi-source massive environmental data analysis and early warning. Authors

    content Highlights • Two definitions of nexus exist but they can be unified under
    integrated system assessment. • Nexus research is classified into three questions:
    internal relationship, external analysis, system evaluation. • Nexus modelling
    should consider research questions, system scales and data availability. • Future
    research challenges are identified to develop sustainable and resilient nexus
    systems. Abstract The water-energy-food nexus has gained increasing attention
    in the research communities as the security of water, energy and food becomes
    a very high concern due to future uncertainties. Studies pertaining to calculations
    of flows and dependencies between different resources, assessments of technology
    and policy applications, and quantifications of system performance have been conducted
    to understand their interlinkages and develop management options. This paper provides
    a state-of-the-art review on the concepts, research questions and methodologies
    in the field of water-energy-food. First, two types of nexus definition are compared
    and discussed to understand the nature of nexus research issues. Then, nexus research
    questions are summarized into three themes: internal relationship analysis, external
    impact analysis, and nexus system evaluation. Eight nexus modelling approaches
    are discussed in terms of their advantages, disadvantages and applications, and
    guidance is provided on the selection of an appropriate modelling approach. Finally,
    future research challenges are identified, including system boundary, data uncertainty
    and modelling, underlying mechanism of nexus issues and system performance evaluation.
    This review helps bring research efforts together to address the challenging questions
    in the nexus research and develop sustainable and resilient water, energy and
    food systems. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Water-energy-food
    nexusDefinitionsResearch questionsUncertaintySystem evaluation 1. Introduction
    The global demand for water, energy and food is driven by rapid population increase,
    urbanization, and climate change and it is estimated to increase by over 50% by
    2050, compared with the 2015 level (Ferroukhi et al., 2015). This will pose a
    huge pressure on existing water, energy and food systems, which have already been
    constrained due to the competing needs for limited resources in many parts of
    the world. More importantly, water, energy and food are interlinked, for example,
    extreme droughts caused by climate changes can lead to significant food and energy
    security problems due to intensified water supply stress. Under such circumstances,
    the concept of water-energy-food nexus was conceived to study and manage the global
    resource systems (e.g., water, energy and food) comprehensively (Smajgl et al.,
    2015; Rasul, 2016; Yillia, 2016). The concept of the ‘nexus’ has gained increasing
    attention in the research and policy making communities (Garcia and You, 2016;
    Weitz et al., 2017). Such systematic thinking is valuable, as ignorance of the
    interlinkages among these three sectors may result in unforeseeable, adverse consequences.
    Biofuel is one of the vivid examples. The rapid bioenergy development, which was
    initially advocated to mitigate climate change by shifting away from fossil fuels,
    has the potential to cause biodiversity loss (Meehan et al., 2010) and food crisis
    by land use changes, as biomass crops may compete with food for water and land.
    Similar cases can also be found in technology applications where the adoption
    of water-conserving irrigation and desalination technologies may create pressures
    in energy sector through intensive energy consumptions. Significant efforts have
    been made to explore the water-energy-food nexus from various aspects, including
    calculation of resource flows and their dependencies, assessment of technology
    and policy applications, and quantification of system performance. What''s more,
    several literature reviews have been published to illustrate the concepts of water-energy-food
    nexus (Biggs et al., 2015; de Grenade et al., 2016; Wichelns, 2017; Cai et al.,
    2018), simulation tools (Kaddoura and El Khatib, 2017; Dai et al., 2018), and
    nexus governance (Weitz et al., 2017) or implementation (Vakilifard et al., 2018).
    This helped to improve people''s perceptions about the water-energy-food nexus.
    However, none of the reviews provides a critical analysis of nexus concepts, research
    questions, and their implications on the selection of modelling approaches (Chang
    et al., 2016). Hence, in this paper, we provide a critical review on the water-energy-food
    nexus from three aspects, including the nexus concepts, research questions and
    methodologies, and identify the directions and challenges for future research.
    This will help bring research efforts together to address the challenging questions
    in the nexus and develop the consensus on building sustainable and resilient water,
    energy and food systems. 2. Research methodology of literature review With an
    aim to illustrate the concepts and applications of the water-energy-food nexus,
    a database consisted of published articles all over the world from the Web of
    Science and Google Scholar was established. Keywords such as “water-energy nexus”,
    “water-food nexus”, “water-energy-food nexus”, “climate change & food-energy-water
    nexus”, “bioenergy & water”, “water-energy nexus & modelling”, were chosen as
    search terms. Special attention had also been paid on the policy related research
    to identify applications of nexus in natural resources management. To cover a
    wide range of relevant research, we supplemented papers pertaining to environment,
    resource recovery, water footprints, energy production, and food consumption patterns.
    After that, we exclude irrelevant papers by reading their abstracts and conclusions.
    The final sample consisted of 161 documents, ranging from 2002 to 2018. To extract
    the main focuses in the field of water-energy-food nexus, the selected papers
    were read multiple times. Then the major findings of each paper were noted, together
    with their research scale, adopted methods, illustration of nexus concepts and
    limitations. After that, we held several group meetings to discuss the assessments
    of each article as well as the classification method of the selected papers to
    reach a consensus on the subsequent analysis. Finally, the selected papers were
    classified according to their definitions of nexus, research questions, scales
    and adopted methods. Challenges for future research were also identified by summarizing
    limitations of the selected papers. Those aspects will be presented in the following
    sections with more in-depth analysis. 3. Definitions of nexus The popularity of
    the nexus could be dated back to the World Economic Forum in 2008, where the global
    challenges related to economic development were recognized from the water–energy–food
    nexus perspective. However, no consensus on the nexus definitions has been agreed
    upon (Smajgl et al., 2015; Keskinen et al., 2016; Endo et al., 2017), with varying
    interpretations in different sectors, in different contexts and by different researchers
    (Keskinen et al., 2016). In general, there are two categories of definitions as
    below. In the first category, the nexus is interpreted as the interactions among
    different subsystems (or sectors) within the nexus system (Sanders and Webber,
    2012). For example, the water-energy nexus can be presented as the interdependencies
    between energy and water, as they are coupled in their supply, processing, distribution
    and use (Liu et al., 2016). Likewise, when the system boundary is further extended
    to a water-energy-food system, the nexus can be defined as the interlink between
    water, energy and food (Gulati et al., 2013; Lawford et al., 2013). Thus, water
    is needed during the production processes of both energy and food. Energy is required
    for water abstraction, distribution and treatment. In contrast, food can also
    be used to generate energy in the form of biofuels. Recently, Cai et al. (2018)
    has further illuminated the interactions between water, energy and food from three
    respects, including the interconnected processes (e.g. physical and chemical),
    the input-output relations during resource production, as well as the interactions
    dominated by institutions, markets, and infrastructure. In a word, this category
    focuses on the representation of interactions between different sectors, aiming
    at grasping the overall characteristics of the complex system by its components’
    interlinkages. As the security issues of these three sectors become severe, the
    term emphasizes that failures in one sector may exert pressures on the other two
    sectors, requiring a holistic management among these sectors. In the second category,
    which is more prevalent, the nexus is presented as an analysis approach to quantify
    the links between the nexus nodes (i.e., water, energy and food). There are many
    interpretations about this emerging approach. For example, the Food and Agriculture
    Organization of the United Nations highlighted that the functions of the nexus
    approach was to systematically analyze the coupled human-nature system, and to
    produce an integrated management of natural resources across different sectors
    and scales by building synergies and managing trade-offs (FAO, 2014). While Scott
    et al. (2014) held the view that the essence of nexus was to produce a resource
    recovery, with the byproduct of resource use efficiency improvements. Smajgl et
    al. (2015) deepened the understanding of this approach to a continuously evolving
    system, arguing that the interactions among nexus nodes ought to be dynamically
    addressed. Meanwhile, Keskinen et al. (2016) contended that the content of the
    nexus is so rich that it could not be interpreted from a single perspective. Therefore,
    they preferred to define it from three aspects, including an analytical method,
    governance tool and an emerging discipline, which complemented one another. Despite
    the differences between two definitions above, we can conclude that the nexus
    is put forward to call for an integrated management of the three sectors by cross-sector
    coordination in order to reduce unexpected sectoral trade-offs and promote the
    sustainable development of each sector. In this regard, it differs from conventional
    decision-making practices that are previously considered within separate disciplines
    (Liu et al., 2015). 4. Research questions The nexus encompasses a broad range
    of issues and therefore studies on this topic vary considerably in terms of their
    focuses. There are many ways to classify current nexus research questions. For
    example, as for the number of nodes, current studies could be divided into three
    categories, namely, two-node nexus research (e.g., energy-irrigation (Mukherji,
    2007; Shah et al., 2007), energy-water (Marsh and Sharma, 2007; Hussey and Pittock,
    2010; Gheewala et al., 2011; Lu and Thisse, 2011; Stillwell et al., 2011; Li et
    al., 2012), food-energy (Walsh et al., 2018), water-land (Chen et al., 2018)),
    three-node nexus studies (e.g., water-energy-food (Smidt et al., 2016), energy-food-water
    (Howarth and Monasterolo, 2016), water-energy-climate (Mu and Khan, 2009), land
    use-climate change-energy (Dale et al., 2011), environment-water-climate (Groenfeldt,
    2010)), and four-node nexus studies (e.g., water-food-energy-climate (Waughray,
    2011; Beck and Walker, 2013), climate-land-energy-water (Hermann et al., 2012)).
    If we focus on the framework arrangement of nodes within the nexus, the current
    research can be divided into two categories: with a center (Hoff, 2011; Ringler
    et al., 2013; Rasul, 2014) and no center (Bizikova et al., 2013; Benson et al.,
    2015). Their differences lie in how important each of nexus sectors is compared
    with others. In other words, frameworks with certain centers usually emphasize
    the role of the center in the entire nexus system, indicating that changes in
    the framework center dominate the state of other related sectors through their
    interlinkages directly. Treating the coupled system as a circle comprised of several
    subsystems, we propose to classify the research questions into three categories:
    internal relationship analysis, external impact analysis, and evaluation of the
    coupled system. Such classification, which focuses more on the connections between
    different sectors as well as the descriptions of coupled system performance, is
    helpful to understand the nexus connotation and extension, as it distinguishes
    system response to external environment (e.g. climate change and policies) from
    the inner features of the coupled system. This also provides valuable insights
    for decision-makers in policy making and assessment. 4.1. Internal relationship
    analysis The internal relationship analysis presents inner features of the coupled
    system by capturing the interactions between different sectors. To make a clear
    outline of the internal relationship analysis, the interactions between different
    sectors are distinguished as one-way impact analysis and interactive impact analysis,
    as shown in Table 1. Table 1. The internal impact analysis. Empty Cell One-way
    impact analysis Interactive impact analysis Connections • Unilateral relationship
    • Mutual relationships • Bilateral relationship • Feedback loops Advantages •
    Lower requirements of resources (e.g. data, time, human, financing) • Provide
    more comprehensive assessments of nexus systems • Manifest how changes in one
    specific sector affect other sectors • Determine the control or dependence role
    among multiple sectors • Facilitate preliminary assessments of trade-offs • Identify
    the driving factors or processes • Serve as a starting point towards integrated
    managements • Inspire new solutions for nexus issues from holistic perspectives
    Disadvantages • Manifest limited capacity in nexus analysis due to inability to
    reflect feedback and second-round effects • Resource intensive in terms of time,
    data, human and financing Characteristics • Simple and targeted • Complex and
    holistic The one-way impact analysis, which manifests how changes in one specific
    sector may affect its associated sectors, has the potential to provide valuable
    preliminary insights for decision making even without a comprehensive description
    of the whole nexus system (Ferroukhi et al., 2015), as it accounts for the potential
    trade-offs between different sectors to some extent. Many studies employ this
    one-way impact analysis to investigate nexus impacts due to its analytical simplicity
    and lower requirements of research resources (e.g. data, time, financing, etc.).
    For example, Babel et al. (2011) found that land use change caused by biofuel
    production may have an adverse impact on water quality and quantity, noting that
    physical and environmental aspects ought to be taken into account in bioenergy
    policy making. Kondolf et al. (2014) investigated the impacts of rapid development
    of hydropower dams and found that an unprecedented boom of hydropower dams might
    result in a greater sediment starvation, leading to a profound effect on downstream
    productivity of the Mekong River (Winemiller, 2017). Recently, this one-way impact
    analysis has been widely employed to analyze the impacts of applications of new
    technologies within a certain sector on others, as the development of new technologies
    provides new ways to address the scarcity of resources, with significant impacts
    on current interlinkages between nexus sectors. To capture the impact of shifts
    toward more energy-intensive water use, Sanders and Webber (2012) made a water-related
    energy consumption estimation within “energy for water” system boundaries, indicating
    that the direct water and steam services account for 12.6% of the 2010 annual
    primary energy consumption in the United States. Likewise, energy consumption
    in wastewater treatment plants can be reduced under innovative technologies of
    energy recovery (Stillwell et al., 2010), integrated real time control (Meng et
    al., 2017), and operational permitting (Meng et al., 2016). In contrast, Denooyer
    et al. (2016) demonstrated that the cooling technology shift from open-loop to
    closed-loop can reduce water withdraws but increase water consumption, noting
    that site-specific factors are critical to the choice of thermoelectric cooling
    technologies as increase in water consumption may cause unintended consequences
    downstream. Although above one-way impact studies facilitate preliminary assessments
    of nexus impacts and trade-offs, they merely draw a partial picture of nexus systems
    and manifest limited capacity in nexus analysis owing to their inability to reflect
    feedback and second-round effects (Ferroukhi et al., 2015). Different from the
    simple unilateral impact analysis, the interactive impact analysis could describe
    the characteristics of the nexus more comprehensively. It can reveal the mutual
    interrelationship between different sectors through bilateral relationships and
    feedback loops, which helps to determine the control or dependence role among
    multiple sectors and identify the driving factors and processes in the development
    of the coupled system. For example, setting in the context of transboundary basins,
    Keskinen et al. (2016) qualitatively evaluated the bilateral relations between
    water, energy, and food in major basins of South Asia and Central Asia, noting
    that energy and food had greater impacts on water resources in Central Asia while
    the impact of water supply changes on food was more pronounced in South Asia.
    The results of Siddiqi and Anadon (2011) showed that the dependence of energy
    sector on water resources was weak, whereas the dependence of water abstraction,
    desalination, and treatment processes on energy was strong in Middle East and
    North Africa. Besides, numerous studies attempt to present the interactive impacts
    between different sectors by depicting their feedback loops through interactions,
    as changes in the feedback strength and rearrangement of couplings may characterize
    the dynamics of the system (Kumar, 2015). For instance, wastewater reuse for agricultural
    production inspired new solutions to advancing the food-energy-water nexus in
    arid-regions by reducing energy consumptions required for fertilizer and increasing
    agricultural yields in arid-regions with poor soils, as well as improving water
    quality by nutrient retention in agriculture irrigation (Mortensen et al., 2016).
    While Zaman et al. (2012) found that application of tractor in agricultural production
    led to more energy demand in Pakistan which in turn stimulated the increase of
    its irrigated agricultural land and share of agriculture value in economy from
    1975 to 2010. 4.2. External impact analysis The water-energy-food nexus system
    is usually set in a certain circumstance. Any external environment changes can
    complicate the performance of nexus systems by shaping the production and use
    of water, energy and food through interconnected processes. The categorization
    structure employed by Butler et al. (2017) for external threats in water systems
    is extended to water-energy-food nexus systems. Here, external threats refer to
    the impacts of outside force, entity, or actor (climate change, pollution incidents,
    population growth, politics, etc.). The underlying motivation of partitioning
    of external and internal factors (or threats) is to identify key factors that
    drive nexus system dynamics. It is also helpful to define system boundary and
    clarify research issues at the initial or modelling stage. What''s more, partitioning
    of the driving factors enables us to conduct a more targeted analysis and provide
    valuable insights for prioritization of interventions (Butler et al., 2017), although
    the categorization is subjective to some extent. The external impact factors can
    be classified into four categories based on their sources and occurrence time,
    as shown in Fig. 1. According to their sources, external factors can be classified
    into two groups, including physical and social causes. Physical factors such as
    climate change, extreme weather and natural hazards may change the provision of
    water, energy and food by influencing their supply chains and production processes.
    Extreme weather such as droughts and floods might have significant negative impacts
    on agricultural productivity (Challinor et al., 2010; Bandara and Cai, 2014) and
    energy generation (Famiglietti, 2014) through water availability. It has been
    proved that both a hotter climate (with more consumptive water use) and a wetter
    climate (with increasing irrigation areas) could increase the water and energy
    use for crops in river basins where agricultural production relies on canal water
    and groundwater pumping for irrigation (Yang et al., 2016). Beyond that, higher
    potential evaporation caused by climate change may even increase tradeoffs between
    hydropower generation and irrigation water use due to decreased water availability
    (Zeng et al., 2017). While social factors such as user behavior and perception
    may move the focus of resources management from supply side to demand side. For
    instance, human dietary habits can change energy use and water footprint throughout
    the food supply chain. Shifts from current food consumption patterns in US to
    a food mix diet could increase energy use by 38%, and blue-water footprint by
    10% (Tom et al., 2016). In addition, policies and technology may impact the nexus
    systems through interactions between different resources. It has been demonstrated
    that agricultural policies in China aiming to improve food security and self-sufficiency
    may lead to a remarkable decline in local groundwater resources (Ghose, 2014).
    What''s worse, agricultural water conservation subsidies and applications of more
    efficient irrigation technologies may actually aggravate water depletions by reducing
    valuable return flows and limiting aquifer recharge (Ward and Pulido-Velazquez,
    2008). Download : Download high-res image (529KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. The classification of external factors. The external factors can
    also be divided based on their occurrence time. The occurrence of extreme weather
    as well as natural hazards may change nexus systems in a relatively short time.
    It has been demonstrated that the hydropower production in the Iberia was reduced
    by 40% due to the 2004/05 drought (García-Herrera et al., 2007). To survive the
    drought, the countries in Iberian Peninsula switched to massive imports of fossil
    fuel to produce less water-intensive power (García-Herrera et al., 2007), achieving
    the decoupling between water and energy sector. Such situation is also suited
    to policy changes which may affect human behaviors rapidly. A recent study conducted
    by Housh et al. (2015) demonstrated that implementing the mandate for cellulosic
    biofuel production (e.g. Miscanthus) on the Mississippi River Basin had the potential
    to reduce the nitrate-N loads but introduce stress on streamflow and associated
    ecosystem services by increasing the water consumption through Miscanthus cultivation.
    However, the period to recognize the impacts of population growth (Mu and Khan,
    2009), climate change (Waughray, 2011; Beck and Walker, 2013) and land use (Al-Bakri
    et al., 2013) on nexus systems is much longer. Comparing the conditions in the
    year of 2000 to those in 2030 and 2050 respectively, Mu and Khan (2009) indicated
    that an increasing grain demand caused by population growth may require further
    intensification of land and water use, and climate change might cause declines
    of availability in both surface water and groundwater resources. While Berardy
    and Chester (2017) found that the temperature increase due to climate change over
    multiple decades is expected to result in more water and energy consumption through
    increasing irrigation requirements in Arizona where agriculture has a high dependency
    on energy-intensive water supply. Besides the above concerns, the term of nexus
    is also directed to manage the complex nexus system efficiently and sustainably
    (Anik Bhaduri and Scheumann, 2015). Some researchers have attempted to evaluate
    the effectiveness of policies from diverse interest groups through a nexus prospective.
    Establishing an energy-water-land nexus system, Howells et al. (2013) estimated
    that the benefits of a local biofuel development related policy, which was proposed
    to guarantee the energy security indoor and to reduce GHG emissions, were precarious
    due to climate change in Mauritius. Investigating two possible joint operation
    modes of Rogun Dam and Nurek Dam, Jalilov et al. (2016) suggested that neither
    the Energy Mode nor the Irrigation Mode could lead to optimal benefits for all
    the riparian countries from the water-energy-food nexus perspective. 4.3. Evaluation
    of the coupled system Except for internal and external impact analyses, assessment
    of the whole system performance, such as resilience (Hosseini et al., 2016) and
    sustainability (Nguyen et al., 2014), is another nascent field of current research.
    Resilience refers to the ability of a system maintain and recover its essential
    functions during and after an external shock or disturbance (Hosseini et al.,
    2016). Evaluation of resilience of the nexus system is important for comprehensive
    management of complex system and rational exploitation and utilization of resources,
    as irreversible changes may occur once the external disturbance beyond a certain
    range. Attempts have been made to evaluate the system performance under changing
    environment from resilience perspective. For instance, Suweis et al. (2015) found
    that the resilience of a coupled population-food system was losing due to the
    increasing dependency of food security on global trade. The negative impacts of
    policy changes on system resilience have also been identified. It was demonstrated
    that water conservation (e.g. improvements in irrigation efficiency) subsidies
    could result in an increasing water use through irrigation expansion. What''s
    worse, such policy change may even aggravate water scarcity, deteriorate water
    quality, and impair river basin resilience through loss of flexibility and redundancy
    (Scott et al., 2014). Beyond that, the term of resilience is also useful to validate
    the coping strategies in response to climate disruption within nexus systems.
    The study conducted by Scanlon et al. (2013) suggested that applications of natural
    gas in power generation were feasible to cope with water-energy nexus issues along
    with droughts as they consumed less water in electricity generation compared to
    traditional coal or nuclear power plants, which contributed to the resilience
    enhancement of power plant during droughts. Besides resilience, system sustainability,
    which represents system''s ability to continue its functionality with limited
    resources indefinitely, is also important for coupled systems, as ignorance of
    it may result in shortsighted policies which may work initially but fail in the
    long run. Establishing a biofuel production system consisting of three subsystems
    (e.g. water supply, biomass production and biofuel), Nguyen et al. (2014) demonstrated
    that raising the dependencies of water supply on biomass production may decrease
    the system sustainability, implying that the quality of the coupled system may
    degrade as time went on. However, due to the vague definition of system sustainability,
    quantifications of this performance measure are still limited. 5. Modelling approaches
    There are various methodologies for the nexus research, however, research priorities,
    aims, scales and data availability are found critical to decide which approach
    should be used for the water-energy-food nexus research. Moreover, no single approach
    is applicable for all situations (Endo et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2017). As illustrated
    in Fig. 2, the appropriate methods vary in response to the scale and research
    priorities of a specific nexus system. Specifically, a higher degree of data aggregation
    is likely to be required as the system scale moves up. Conversely, more detail
    of the inner mechanism of the nexus system, both social and physical should be
    represented, as the system scales down. Accordingly, models, such as the computable
    general equilibrium model, econometric analysis, and ecological network analysis,
    play important roles in large scale nexus research as their consideration of man-made
    links (e.g. global supply chains of food and energy (Lawford et al., 2013)) creates
    opportunities to investigate the socioeconomic interactions between remote places
    (Silviu, 2015). However, the investigation and mathematical methods can be applied
    to illustrate nexus issues at almost all scales due to their strength in overcoming
    data absence and providing valuable insights during an initial stage. While the
    agent-based model is much more suitable for revealing the individuals'' decision
    impacts for their consideration of individuals’ heterogeneities and life-cycle
    analysis exert its advantages in assessments of policy and technology shift pertaining
    to resources consumption and environment. Besides, the integrated index is powerful
    to include various social and environmental factors in policy planning. Download

    Summary of nexus research methods and their applications. Based on the state-of-the-art
    research methods, the eight key approaches, i.e., investigation and statistical
    methods, computable general equilibrium model, econometric analysis, ecological
    network analysis, life-cycle analysis, system dynamics model, agent-based modelling
    and integrated index, are discussed briefly in terms of their advantages, disadvantages
    and applications, with an aim to identify research gaps in current nexus methods.
    5.1. Investigations and mathematical statistics Investigations and mathematical
    statistics, which illustrate nexus issues through field surveys, expert panel,
    and collections of public data released by local agencies and governments, and
    related literatures, are the most widely used methods to explore the interactions
    between nexus sectors. Tracing related resources consumptions associated with
    the production process of a certain resources, researchers could make quantitative
    assessments about the interactions between water, energy, food and other resources
    through data analysis. Adopting such method, Machell et al. (2014) identified
    that electric power generation accounted for approximately 15% of total global
    freshwater water withdrawals and about 70% of global water was consumed by food
    production. While Ramırez et al. (2006) revealed that strong hygiene regulations
    may account for one or two-third of the total increase of energy consumption in
    the meat industry of four European countries as the temperature of water used
    for cleaning and sterilization increased from 60 °C in 1990 to 82 °C in 2001 for
    the sake of food safety. Through field surveys, Alimagham et al. (2017) found
    that conventional scenarios of soybean production are more environment-friendly
    in comparison with mechanized scenarios because of their lower energy consumption
    and GHG emissions. Such methods are also useful to capture pivotal factors (e.g.
    climate change, land use changes, demographics, basin infrastructure) which dominate
    the evolution processes of the water-energy-food nexus system. Aggregating the
    questionnaire responses across all respondents, Lawford et al. (2013) obtained
    the ranking of the importance of different factors that may influence the Water-Energy-Food
    Nexus, and provided some recommendations to improve the sustainability of each
    individual sector based on the ranking. Likewise, Smajgl et al. (2015) succeeded
    in formulating the dynamic framework of water-energy-food nexus in Mekong basin
    by identification of interlinked variables between different sectors through the
    Delphi technique which relied on investigations of a panel of experts. The studies
    above demonstrate the fact that there exist complex interlinkages between nexus
    sectors, and qualitative analyses (e.g., Lawford et al. (2013); Smajgl et al.
    (2015)) can bring some valuable insights into decision making. Moreover, key variables,
    which can be potentially estimated for a broad range of impact categories at various
    scales (global, national and local scales), pave the way for an integrated nexus
    modelling and assessment (Liu et al., 2016). Yet, statistical approaches cannot
    provide insights into the internal mechanism of interactions between water, energy
    and food, resulting in great difficulties in policy making and evaluating. 5.2.
    Computable general equilibrium model The computable general equilibrium model
    (CGE) is a kind of economic model, which is widely applied to policy analyses
    pertaining to economy (Silviu, 2015). The CGE models can evaluate the impacts
    of policies on the nexus systems through price mechanism by grasping the interlinkages
    relevant to market behavior and changes (Ge et al., 2014). Considerable progresses
    have been made in nexus quantifications with various CGE models, including GTAP-W
    model (Calzadilla et al., 2011), GEM-E3 model (Kancs and Wohlgemuth, 2008; Németh
    et al., 2011) and IMPACT model (Rosegrant et al., 2002). Using the GTAP-W model,
    Calzadilla et al. (2011) demonstrated that the effects of trade liberalization
    on agricultural production and water use are modest. While Wianwiwat and Asafu-Adjaye
    (2013) identified that promoting bio-liquid policies would increase the price
    of manufactured food and decrease the food manufacturing in the short term, but
    their effects would be smaller in the long run, indicating that the adverse impacts
    of such policies on food security were limited in the long term. Similar research
    is also conducted by Ge et al. (2014), which shows that even though the expansion
    of non-grain fuel ethanol raises the food prices by intensifying the competition
    of land, capital and labor between food and fuel ethanol production, a supply
    of marginal land to non-grain fuel ethanol can still enhance the food security
    in China by reducing food imports, providing valuable insights to manage the trade-off
    between biofuel energy production and food security. Although the CGE model could
    provide a comprehensive interpretation about the macro-economy and its interaction
    with the natural resource system, challenges in the above methods still exist.
    With a large number of parameters involved, the validity of the model results
    highly depends on the quality of the data which are used in model calibration.
    Moreover, the hypothesis about the economy within the model is somewhat identical
    or simple that it may not be in accordance with the realities, leading to a large
    deviation of the policy evaluation. 5.3. Econometric analysis Econometric analysis
    employs statistical methods to provide empirical content to economic relations
    by analyzing non-experimental economic data (Wooldridge, 2012). The method of
    multiple regression analysis lays the foundation for econometric analysis. However,
    econometric analysis is different from general statistical methods introduced
    in Section 5.1, as it manifests nexus systems through a set of mathematical equations
    and elucidates nexus issues based on economic theories. Econometric techniques
    and procedures have been widely used to infer causality (Huang et al., 2008) and
    test economic theories (Pao and Tsai, 2011; Allard et al., 2018) in the field
    of nexus research. For example, the regression results of Zaman et al. (2012)
    empirically revealed the bi-directional causality between agricultural growth
    and energy consumption in Pakistan, demonstrating that actions pertaining to promoting
    energy efficiency and diversifying energy sources will indeed contribute to sustained
    economic growth in Pakistan where agriculture plays a dominant role in economy.
    Pao and Tsai (2011) confirmed the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis for the
    four BRIC countries, noting that the relationship between CO2 emissions and gross
    domestic product fits an inverted-U curve. Beyond the above research, numerous
    attempts have also been made to examine the validity of existing policies. A recent
    research, which investigated the impacts of biofuel production on the ecosystem
    in six regions of the world through panel econometric techniques, confirmed the
    conclusion that expansion of biofuels was not a good choice to cope with climate
    change given its negative impacts on biodiversity and water resource at the global
    scale (Zaman et al., 2016). Similar methods have been utilized to provide recommendations
    for future policy design. Ozturk (2015) manifested the food-energy-water nexus
    for the BRICS countries by simultaneously modelling each individual sector that
    was linked separately to multiple regressors, noting that food security may be
    challenging for the five countries as the demand and supply gaps of energy and
    water widened. This indicates that economic-environmental policies are imperative
    to stimulate sustainable development for the BRICS countries in the long-run,
    as increasing energy demand for economic growth may lead to environment degradation
    among the five countries (Ozturk, 2015). Econometric analysis is more targeted
    and efficient in policy assessment and design than general statistical methods.
    However, analogous to CGE models, econometric models heavily rely on data (Semertzidis,
    2015), and some underlying assumptions may not be justified (Hamiche et al., 2016).
    What''s worse, misleading conclusions may be drawn due to ignorance of key variables
    in econometric models and application of small data samples (Pao and Tsai, 2011).
    To get more reliable results, it is suggested to use large sample sizes, panel
    data approach (Huang et al., 2008), and multivariate models to conduct econometric
    analysis (Zachariadis, 2007; Ozturk, 2010). In addition, unrecorded economy should
    be considered to get closer to real economy when making assumptions in econometric
    modelling (Ozturk, 2010). 5.4. Ecological network analysis Ecological network
    analysis (ENA) evolved from input-output analysis (Chen and Chen, 2015) is currently
    one of the main methods for evaluating the interactions between economic and natural
    components. Taking systems as the integration of multiple entities connected by
    metabolic flows, ENA can offer a unified analysis for both direct and indirect
    flows embodied in interwoven chains of production and consumption, indicating
    the potential to investigate the trade-off between multiple elements (Chen and
    Chen, 2016). It has been used to dissect metabolic flows (e.g. water, energy,
    carbon emissions) in urban metabolism (Chen and Chen, 2016, 2017a) and global
    trade of energy (Duan and Chen, 2017) and virtual water (Yang et al., 2012). Combined
    with other metrics such as linkage analysis (Lenzen, 2003; Fang and Chen, 2017),
    Finn''s cycling index (Finn, 1976) and system robustness (Fath, 2015), ENA is
    capable to detect the role transition of a sector and quantify the system performance
    (cycling and resilience). For example, using Beijing as an example, Chen and Chen
    (2016) identified that most urban sectors rely on manufacturing in the energy–water
    nexus, and the impact of nexus on energy networks (±200%) is larger than water
    networks (±30%). Furthermore, the average robustness of the energy-water nexus
    network seemed to be lower compared to natural ecosystems, as it had more intensive
    material exchanges (Chen and Chen, 2016). In addition, compartment-oriented ENA
    metrics such as control allocation and dependence allocation can identify the
    control or dependence role among multiple sectors (or components) by tracking
    the metabolic (or material) flows (Chen and Chen, 2015). This analysis is critical
    for locating the driving factors of changing nexus systems and inspiring new solutions
    for resources management from both systemic and sectoral levels (Chen and Chen,
    2016). For instance, with the aid of control allocation and dependence allocation,
    Chen and Chen (2017b) revealed that high-pollution industries which were moved
    outside the urban boundary of Beijing, were expected to have impacts on the local
    carbon emissions for the constant demand of urban citizens, indicating that carbon-cutting
    policies might not be effective unless a full optimization of supply chains was
    given. Duan and Chen (2017) applied a similar approach to investigate the mutual
    interactions between water and energy inherent in global energy trade and took
    China as an example to demonstrate the usefulness of such analysis in policy design.
    Their results showed that although no country was controlled by China via energy
    trade, the international trade of energy made China''s water security more vulnerable
    to other countries due to strong water import dependence associated with energy
    products. This informed the policy makers that strategies pertaining to reduce
    the proportion of water-intensive products in energy import mix are more beneficial.
    Despite the strength of ENA in analysis of complex interactions, ENA is essentially
    a static method due to its steady-state assumption that the inputs must equal
    the outputs for each component and the whole network. Hence, the dynamic characteristics
    of the network system cannot be captured unless a longitudinal study is conducted
    (Yang et al., 2012). In addition, the implication of ENA in urban planning is
    still limited due to its sectoral level analysis and the lack of indicators directly
    related to land-use based urban planning (Chen and Chen, 2015), although ENA can
    be related to environmentally friendly planning for its consumption-based insights
    (Chen et al., 2014). 5.5. Life-cycle analysis Life-cycle analysis (LCA) is one
    of the most widely used methods for quantifying the environmental impacts of a
    given product or process throughout its entire life cycle. It can accurately show
    the quantification of any unit during its life cycle and easily export its calculation
    processes, with the characteristics of identifying all of the inputs or outputs
    that may have significant impacts on environment (Nair et al., 2014). Due to above
    advantages, LCA approach, which could provide a consistent analytical framework
    and environmental data support for decision-making, has been extensively applied
    in assessing the environmental impact of nexus sectors across their production
    and consumption processes, aiming to seek effective ways to cope with current
    resources shortage and global climate change. Using the integrated life cycle
    assessment (LCA) method, Al-Ansari et al. (2015) made an integrated environmental
    evaluation of energy, water and food supply chains, and indicated that food system
    had the most significant impact on global warming. While Feng et al. (2014) proved
    that wind power production, compared to other electricity generation technologies,
    would significantly reduce the carbon emissions and water consumption over its
    whole life cycle. In addition, LCA has also been frequently applied for evaluating
    the impacts of construction and operation of urban water supply facilities on
    environment (Lundie et al., 2004; Friedrich et al., 2007; Foley et al., 2010).
    Foley et al. (2010), for instance, demonstrated that operational energy and greenhouse
    gas emissions presented a positive relationship with nitrogen removal and a non-significant
    correlativity with phosphorus removal in wastewater treatment plants. Such method
    is also useful for policy-making by comparing the impacts resulting from different
    options. For example, results of Chang et al. (2015) implied that a coal-to-shale
    gas shift in power generation was a promising way to a lower water intensive electricity
    in China, as the water consumption of shale gas-fired electricity was less than
    that of China''s present coal-fired electricity given the extraction-to-wire effects.
    However, the LCA method still has some drawbacks despite its extensive applications
    in nexus research. With a high dependency on data, the LCA method is difficult
    to apply in data-scarce regions (Hamiche et al., 2016). Moreover, due to the subjective
    decision of the definition about the system boundaries, it is therefore inevitable
    to leave out some production processes, which often leads to significant truncation
    errors in the calculations of LCA. Further, the LCA seems to be a static method
    and may not be directly suitable for dynamic analyses of complex systems (Nair
    et al., 2014). To some extent, it is difficult to consider social factors within
    a coupled system based on LCA method with a focus on assessments of environmental
    impacts (Balkema et al., 2002). 5.6. System dynamics modelling System dynamics
    modelling (SDM), a top-down modelling method based on causal mechanism, follows
    the assumption that system behaviors are determined by their structures. It allows
    comprehensive analysis of multi-sectoral systems at both macro and micro levels
    by establishing causal feedback loops among the elements within a certain system.
    This makes it well suited for multidisciplinary and multi-actor problems (Stave,
    2003). For example, Chhipi-Shrestha et al. (2017) had adopted such method to identify
    critical factors that constrained the sustainability of the urban water system
    in Penticton, noting that it was the hot water use that contributed the most to
    energy use and carbon emissions of the operational phase of the urban water system.
    Such approach has also been extensively applied in policy evaluation. Establishing
    main causal-loop diagrams of the climate-energy-water nexus, Newell et al. (2011)
    found that technology innovation, increase of redundancy in distribution and transmission
    networks and a dynamic system thinking in policy-making were helpful to improve
    the resilience of the national electricity market in Australia. While El-Gafy
    (2014) demonstrated that raising the self-sufficiency from wheat in Egypt through
    wheat trade pattern policies were expected to increase its wheat cultivated area
    as well as water footprint of wheat production for the interval 2010–2050, compared
    with the base line scenario in 2010. Such models contribute a lot to overcoming
    difficulties that may otherwise impede the development of holistic policies (Newell
    et al., 2005). The causal feedback loops developed by system dynamics model could
    assist in the identification of the sources of problem behaviors and the understanding
    of the feedback structure of the system. Based on the dynamic analysis under different
    scenarios, the system dynamics model could offer optimal system structures to
    coordinate the various factors within the system and provide scientific basis
    for decision-making. However, due to the subjective abstraction and simplification
    of the nexus system during modelling process, it is necessary to involve relevant
    stakeholders in the SDM modelling process as much as possible to avoid the inconsistences
    between reality and the model caused by subjective factors. 5.7. Agent-based modelling
    Agent-based modelling (ABM) is a ‘‘bottom-up’’ approach where every agent is a
    discrete autonomous entity with distinct goals and actions within a particular
    social context. By modelling agents individually, the full effects of the diversity
    that exists among agents in their attributes and the behaviors can be observed
    at the bottom level (Macal and North, 2010). What''s more, the emergent phenomena
    at the system level can also be investigated through aggregation of all agents''
    behaviors (Du et al., 2017). Thus, agent-based modelling breaks through the limitations
    of single-level and individual-perspective, and provides a more realistic and
    effective modelling framework for describing and investigating complex systems
    by offering a way to model social systems that are composed of numerous agents
    which can interact with and influence each other, learn from their experiences,
    and adapt their behaviors so they are better suited to their environment. Recently,
    Ng et al. (2011) established an agent-based hydrologic-agronomic model to explore
    the interlinkages between the farmers'' planting decisions and their associated
    effects on stream nitrate load when carbon allowance trading, and markets for
    crops (including biofuel crop) are considered. Their results proved the usefulness
    of such models for coupled human-environment nexus within a watershed. Hereafter,
    Khan et al. (2017) investigated the impacts of agents'' water resource management
    decisions on the water-food-energy-environment nexus system at watershed scale
    through a more generalized ABM framework by coupling the water system model with
    SWAT model, noting that the impact of agent preferences on crop production was
    more significant than that of hydropower generation. However, due to higher requirements
    of data, challenges of noneconomic behaviors’ definitions and computational requirements,
    application of this method to nexus related issues is currently limited, but promising
    in further research. 5.8. Integrated index The integrated index method usually
    presents various social and environmental characteristics of systems by multiple
    indicators. With the aid of these indicators, researchers are able to capture
    the overall properties of nexus systems regardless their complexity (Endo et al.,
    2015). What''s more, index based methods contribute a lot to comparative assessment
    and benchmarking (Yigitcanlar et al., 2015) by describing system performance in
    a uniform and standardized format. For example, Kourtit et al. (2017) derived
    a holistic picture of sustainability of 39 global cities based on their efficiency
    performance indicators, indicating that European cities gain higher sustainability
    efficiency scores in terms of their human environment. Beyond that, this method
    can also provide valuable information for policy planning by manifesting a comprehensive
    outline of nexus issues (Flörke et al., 2018; Schlör et al., 2018). Taking urban
    surface-water deficit as an indicator, Flörke et al. (2018) identified that climate
    change and population growth could intensify the competition of water between
    urban and agricultural sectors, noting that improvement in irrigation efficiency
    became an essential adaptation option to enhance urban water security. As cities
    become the center of water-energy-food nexus discussion (Duić et al., 2014; Wang
    and Chen, 2016; Brandoni and Bošnjaković, 2017; Schlör et al., 2018), efficient
    managements of nexus systems call for consideration of multidimensional performance
    (sociology, ecology, economy, etc.). More integrated indicators should be introduced
    to measure the performance of nexus systems in a holistic way (Yigitcanlar et
    al., 2015; Schlör et al., 2018). The UN-Habitat City Prosperity Index (CPI) was
    therefore proposed to identify factors that make urban cities become more prosperous
    and the areas where policy intervention is needed from five aspects (productivity,
    infrastructure, quality of life, equity, and environmental sustainability) (UN-Habitat,
    2013). After that, attempts have been made to combine CPI with regulations of
    urban nexus. Yigitcanlar et al. (2015) proposed a multi-scalar approach to assess
    the environmental sustainability of CPI in urban cities and applied it to the
    Gold Coast to demonstrate its usefulness. Schlör et al. (2018) established the
    Nexus City Index (NXI) based on CPI and employed it to quantify the resilience
    of the food-energy-water nexus in urban cites. Their results suggested that NXI
    put city resilience on a comparable scale without reducing the complexity of nexus
    systems and offered opportunities to cope with prosperity gaps in urban planning
    (Schlör et al., 2018). Despite the above advantages, the application of such indicators
    in urban planning is still challenging, as it highly depends on systematic database
    (Schlör et al., 2018). In addition, major difficulties also lie in how to build
    a rational index system and eliminate the bias resulting from the use of weights
    among indicators (Yigitcanlar et al., 2015). 6. Directions of future research
    and prospects The existing studies offer a promising outlook for water-energy-food
    nexus from different aspects, which can support in assessing trade-offs, predicting
    potential (unintended) effects, providing a co-optimization base for different
    stakeholders who often have conflicting interests and visualizing the impacts
    for informed decision making (Agboola and Braimoh, 2009; Hurford and Harou, 2014;
    Santhosh et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2015). However, limitations of current studies
    still exist. Grouping the above analysis together, future directions of nexus
    research are identified from four aspects, including the system boundary, data
    uncertainty and modelling, nexus mechanism and system evaluation, as shown in
    Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (564KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. Summary of future nexus research directions. (a) Definitions of
    the system boundary; (b) Date uncertainty and modelling; (c) The underlying mechanism
    referring to the physical, chemical processes associated with resource flows as
    well as their supply chains. For example, setting the nexus issue within a water-hydropower-agriculture
    system, the internal mechanism refers to flow states (e.g. velocity, temperature),
    sediment transport, growth of algae and biochemical reactions (e.g. nitration
    and denitrification via the water-sediment interface) along with hydropower generation
    and food production, as well as decision making mechanisms; (d) The evaluation
    of coupled nexus system, including assessment metrics and quantitative assessment
    approaches. 6.1. System boundary It is of great importance to define the system
    boundary when conducting nexus analysis, as different system boundary definitions
    result in different results. For example, Liu et al. (2016) concluded that energy
    embedded in agricultural, municipal and industrial water use (e.g. irrigation,
    wastewater collection) accounted for 1.0%–1.9% of total primary energy in the
    United States in 2010, however, considering a wider range of processes where energy
    is applied to water for other outputs (e.g. steam-driven power generation), the
    proportion increased to 47% (Sanders and Webber, 2012). The difficulty of system
    boundary definition lies in how to choose an appropriate boundary. On one hand,
    a narrow boundary might leave out some important interlinkages, which means that
    the description of the nexus system is under-representation. For example, merely
    focusing on conflicts between hydropower generation and irrigation issues with
    an ignorance of the interactions between water and inland fisheries in food security
    may lead to a partial evaluation of water-energy-food security nexus in riparian
    countries (Cooke et al., 2016). On the other hand, with a large system boundary,
    more processes are included in the nexus system and thus more data, assumptions
    and detailed understanding of the processes are required to develop a nexus model
    (Garcia and You, 2016). For example, for a global water-energy nexus, a large
    number of end-use processes (e.g., dish cleaning) need to be accounted for, increasing
    the difficulty of modelling due to varied users (Yillia, 2016) and end-use processes
    representation (Kyle et al., 2016). Moreover, it is much more difficult to extract
    and synthesize valuable information from different sectors considering their interactions,
    as the nexus boundary varies from resource management units to administrative
    boundaries (Liu et al., 2017). An appropriate selection of system boundary is
    critical for the nexus and thus required for further research. Currently, it has
    been widely accepted that the definition of system boundaries should base on research
    aims (Avellán et al., 2017; Chen and Chen, 2017a; Albrecht et al., 2018) and data
    availability (Chen and Chen, 2017a). It is of great importance to note that water-energy-food
    nexus can go beyond its system boundaries (Avellán et al., 2017; Chen and Chen,
    2017a). Taking the urban nexus research in Beijing as an example, Chen and Chen
    (2017a) suggested that upstream activities (e.g., indirect energy or water use
    outside Beijing) beyond the system boundaries ought to be considered due to their
    significant impacts on urban metabolism. In this regard, introducing the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response
    (DPSIR) framework designed for adaptive management of Social-Ecological Systems
    (Gari et al., 2015) into modelling might be an effective way to demarcate system
    boundaries, as the scale of the two DPSIR elements (State Change and Impact) within
    the system of concern can provide valuable information for the establishment of
    system boundaries (Atkins et al., 2011). This has been demonstrated by Atkins
    et al. (2011) which showed that DPSIR was capable to quantify the environmental
    state changes as well as their impacts on societal benefits resulting from the
    pressures. 6.2. Data and modelling uncertainty The themes of the research vary
    as the research scale changes, as shown in Fig. 2. In the literature, global scale
    research focuses more on the impacts of climate changes on agriculture and water
    availability, as well as the changes in virtual water/water footprints caused
    by the global trade (Yang et al., 2012; Duan and Chen, 2017). At the national
    scale, more attention is paid to resource security relevant issues as well as
    their associated environment impacts under various policies. While studies pertaining
    to quantification of the interactions between water, energy and food at household
    scale are more concerned about behavioral and technological factors (Abdallah
    and Rosenberg, 2014). Different research problems have different data requirements.
    The larger the system scale is, the more concerns about social and economic data.
    However, the data from government reports and published data are of varying quality
    and availability (Perrone et al., 2011), as they are released by different sectors
    for various purposes without consistent reporting standards (Ernst and Preston,
    2017). The use of these data may cause great uncertainty in the nexus research.
    Moreover, some data are aggregated at large scale (Perrone et al., 2011), making
    it unsuitable for small scale research. This is the case in climate-related nexus
    studies (Waughray, 2011; Beck and Walker, 2013; Berardy and Chester, 2017), where
    application of climate models and their downscaling (Howells et al., 2013) introduces
    uncertainty to the final results. What''s more, assumptions and simplifications
    are frequently introduced in nexus research to deal with data scarcity. For example,
    Liu et al. (2016) had to assign constant energy intensity values to water-related
    processes except desalination in temporal variability analysis of water-related
    energy consumption due to lack of data on those processes. Owing to the lack of
    empirical data, two extremes of behavior (e.g. cautious and bold) are defined
    by Ng et al. (2011) to represent the farmers'' behaviors in their water-energy
    nexus system through an ABM framework, which means the simulate results may not
    adequately represent the reality. Likewise, Jalilov et al. (2016) had to exclude
    the groundwater use for irrigation and introduce many assumptions on cropped area
    and crop water use in an agronomic model when conducting the water-energy-food
    nexus research. Such assumptions or simplifications may help overcome some data
    scarcity, however, they can also exert an impact on the final results and even
    misrepresent the interactions among nexus sectors. In addition, models such as
    CGE, which consist of several sectors including economy, water, crop and energy,
    may have numerous sources of uncertainty, ranging from model inputs and structures
    to scenario assumptions. To address above issues, endeavors should be made to
    improve data availability for nexus research. On one hand, special efforts should
    be made in data monitoring and collection, data processing as well as uncertainty
    analysis. Recently, implications of innovative sensor technologies (Abegaz et
    al., 2018) (including remote sensing (Scanlon et al., 2017)) have been demonstrated
    to have remarkable utility in providing new data sources. Besides, advanced data
    science techniques (e.g., machine learning, correlation analysis, cloud computing
    (McCabe et al., 2017), Geographic Information Systems (Cai et al., 2018), etc.)
    as well as high performance computers are expected to speed up data uptake and
    facilitate analysis of massive datasets. Combination of these techniques indicates
    a promising future for data uptake and analysis. On the other hand, there is an
    urgent need to advance data-sharing through development of new data sharing mechanism
    which can stimulate broad participation and cooperation from different governments,
    research institutions and communities (Fekete et al., 2015). Connecting existing
    and new datasets can produce more accessible and useful data to prioritize problems,
    support nexus modelling and inform decisions (DOE, 2014). In addition, further
    research on the trade-offs between simplicity and comprehensiveness in the modelling
    process will provide new insights to develop appropriate models, generating robust
    results with limited data (Kaddoura and El Khatib, 2017). Beyond that, modelers
    should make the structure of nexus models more standardized and modularized, offering
    opportunities to analyze structural uncertainties better by exchange and recombination
    of model components (DOE, 2014). 6.3. The underlying mechanism of nexus Future
    research needs to characterize the interlinkages between nexus sectors, with a
    focus on understanding of the underlying mechanism of the nexus. One of the most
    critical knowledge gap is that the majority of current studies focus more on the
    supply chains and resource use efficiencies of nexus sectors under different scenarios,
    for example, water use in food production (Siebert et al., 2010; Finley and Seiber,
    2014), energy implications in water use (Kahrl and Roland-Holst, 2008). Yet, consideration
    of physical, biophysical and chemical processes is important for conceptualizing
    relationships of nexus sectors (de Grenade et al., 2016). Knowledge gaps also
    exist in interactions between ecological, economic, and social dimensions (Räsänen
    et al., 2015). Dynamic quantification methods are required to capture the vital
    factors affecting the coupled nexus system performance and to reveal the dynamics
    of natural processes along with social processes that underpin the interactions
    between nexus sectors. For instance, few studies have been conducted to understand
    how the development of hydropower will affect soil erosion, sediment transport
    and nutrient composition (e.g. the nitration and denitrification via the water-sediment
    interface) within rivers. This is important to identify the systemic risk of runoff
    utilization, develop adaptive utilization strategies considering the nexus and
    evaluate the reasonable exploitation scope of hydropower. Based on above, there
    is an urgent need to develop nexus-specific models to provide a better representation
    of nexus systems (Albrecht et al., 2018), as implications of existing models derived
    from other fields (e.g., LCA from management science and econometric analysis
    come from economics) may lead to a partial description of feedback and interactions
    of nexus systems due to these models’ specific design purposes (Miralles-Wilhelm,
    2016). As nexus elements being considered continue to expand (Dai et al., 2018),
    a nexus-specific model ought to be flexible enough to support module extensions
    (Chang et al., 2016), reveal physical and social dynamics, and facilitate analysis
    across multiple temporal and spatial scales (Albrecht et al., 2018). Given current
    data availability, such models are also required to have the ability to combine
    quantitative with qualitative data (Albrecht et al., 2018) to alleviate intensive
    and extensive data requirements during modelling. In addition, to establish an
    integrated and flexible model for water-energy-food nexus, multiple stakeholders
    and decision makers should be engaged into modelling processes to incorporate
    valuable and timely information from different sectors (e.g., technological descriptions,
    human activities) and avoid ignorance of vital processes or interactions owing
    to the site-specific nature of nexus (Keairns et al., 2016; Albrecht et al., 2018),
    which can be done through better interagency collaborations. 6.4. The evaluation
    of coupled nexus systems One motivation of the nexus research is to better manage
    the water-energy-food system in order to promote sustainable development under
    changing environments. Assessments of the resilience and sustainability of the
    coupled systems are therefore important to understand their long-term performance
    under changing environments. However, in water-energy-food system, resilience
    and sustainability depend not only on the characteristics of the individual subsystems
    but also on the interlinkages among different subsystems (Hosseini et al., 2016),
    as changes in one subsystem may cascade quickly and widely through the couple
    system, triggering a series of chain reactions. The assessment metrics and approaches
    designed for individual systems may be no longer applicable to the nexus system
    as a whole. In addition, due to the loose coupling of nexus sectors in most of
    current methods (Yillia, 2016), the feedback is usually considered exogenously,
    resulting in an inadequate representation of the nexus system. All these create
    great challenges for the evaluation of resilience and sustainability of coupled
    systems. Thus, efforts are required to investigate the resilience as well as sustainability
    of the coupled system, including assessment metrics and quantitative assessment
    approaches for nexus systems. However, this might be challenging, as multiple
    dimensions (sociology, ecology, economy, etc.) ought to be included to assess
    nexus system performance owing to the wide connotation of nexus. Fortunately,
    emerging concepts like NXI (Schlör et al., 2018), CPI (UN-Habitat, 2013) and entropy
    theory (Tamvakis and Xenidis, 2013) are expected to rectify this situation, as
    they exemplify how to combine different aspects of the research system in a holistic
    way. What’ s more, Tamvakis and Xenidis (2013) evidenced that the framework based
    on entropy theory was useful to quantify system properties due to their strength
    in capturing underlying interactions (including feedback (Mayer et al., 2014))
    among system components (both living and non-living). This study also informed
    us that transforming system performance into entropy can facilitate a direct and
    explicit way for assessing the overall system behaviors (e.g., resilience (Tamvakis
    and Xenidis, 2013), sustainability (Mayer et al., 2014)) through aggregation of
    behaviors at the component level as a single metric. This can inspire researchers
    to use innovative ways in development of assessment metrics and methods for nexus
    systems. 7. Conclusions This paper provides a critical review on the concepts,
    research questions and methodologies in the field of water-energy-food nexus.
    The key findings are summarized below: 1) Two definitions of nexus currently exist
    in literatures, but they can be unified under integrated system assessment. The
    first one defines nexus as the interlinkage between different resources, while
    the other one treats nexus as a novel approach to investigate nexus systems with
    various meanings in different contexts. The two definitions could be unified through
    integrated management of the nexus to reduce unexpected impacts and sectoral trade-offs
    and promote the sustainability and resilience of the entire nexus system. 2) Current
    research can be classified into three categories: internal relationship analysis,
    external impact analysis, and evaluation of the coupled system. Such classification
    is helpful to catch the hotspots in nexus studies scattered in various disciplines,
    as it stimulates more focuses on the connections between different sectors as
    well as the coupled system performance. What''s more, partitioning of internal
    and external factors enables us to clarify site-specific nexus issues, conduct
    a more targeted analysis, and provide valuable insights for prioritization of
    interventions. 3) Eight modelling approaches are discussed in terms of their advantages,
    disadvantages and applications, providing guidance on model selection in the nexus
    research. It is identified that the connotation of nexus is so rich that no single
    approach is applicable in all situations however the appropriate method should
    be selected considering research priorities, research aims, scales and data availability
    of the nexus system. For example, the CGE Model is more appropriate to investigate
    macro-economy and environmental change at regional and global scales due to its
    consideration of man-made links. While ABM is much more suitable for revealing
    the individuals'' decision impacts for its description of individuals'' heterogeneities
    and decision-making processes. 4) Despite the progress in water-energy-food nexus,
    limitations of current studies still exist, and four challenges for future research
    are identified. Analysis indicates that current research does not adequately address
    problems inherent in system boundary definition as well as the uncertainties associated
    with data and modelling. What''s more, the internal mechanism analysis of nexus
    issues is somewhat constrained due to partial description of nexus systems. Challenges
    also exist in the evaluation of system performance, where nexus-specific assessment
    metrics and quantitative approaches need to be developed. Therefore, more efforts
    are required to advance holistic assessments of water-energy-food nexus. Current
    discussions suggest that implications of DPSIR framework in nexus modelling may
    be useful for clarifying system boundaries, while improvement in data availability
    through innovative technologies is promising to address uncertainties associated
    with data and modelling. Besides, there is an urgent need to develop nexus-specific
    models to elucidate the underlying mechanism inherent in water-energy-food nexus.
    Emerging concepts like NXI, CPI and entropy theory are expected to stimulate more
    holistic assessments of system performance. These efforts may also be helpful
    in providing concise information to support decision-making in reality. In this
    regard, this review helps bring research efforts together to address the challenging
    questions in the nexus research and develop resilient water, energy and food systems.

    Research Coordinator EFSA. Approved: 14 June 2019 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE The
    European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) regularly collects recommendations from
    members of the Scientific Committee and Scientific Panels on EFSA''s research
    needs and priorities (EFSA, 2017). At the end of the 2015–2018 Scientific Panels
    mandate, we collected views of outgoing Panel members on what food safety research
    areas should be prioritised for the coming 5–10 years. The objective was, not
    only to capitalise on experience gained during the Panel mandate, but also to
    inform research agendas, such as the upcoming Horizon Europe – Research Programme.
    The identification of risk assessment research priorities and the communication
    of such priorities to the relevant actors is an important aspect of the ‘EFSA
    Strategy 2020: Trusted science for safe food’.1 In addition to the Panel members,
    EFSA staff and other EFSA partner organisations and stakeholders were consulted,
    including the following: By July 2018, 43 research needs were received from Scientific
    Committee/Scientific Panel members, as well as from EFSA''s own scientific staff,
    describing briefly the scope and desired impact of the research. These research
    needs were collated and shared with EFSA''s Advisory Forum for comments by September
    2018. During EFSA''s Scientific Conference (18–21 September 2018),2 EFSA consulted
    the wider scientific community participating in the conference and received 30
    additional contributions. The various inputs were grouped into themes, and then
    tabled for consultation with EFSA''s stakeholders at the Stakeholder Forum meeting
    (20 November 2018).3 These consultations formed the basis for EFSA to formulate
    its regulatory research priorities under three research streams (Safe Food Systems,
    Innovation in Risk Assessment, and Holistic Risk Assessment). These research streams
    and priorities were tabled at the workshop: ‘Food Safety Systems for the Future’
    on 17 January 2019 that was convened by Directorate General Research & Innovation,
    where the chair of EFSA''s Scientific Committee introduced the first break-out
    session to define the main challenges and opportunities for food safety. In February
    2019, the Scientific Committee discussed and endorsed the research needs. In formulating
    the research needs, attention was paid to relate to the current debate and reflections
    in preparation towards Horizon Europe. In particular, the Food20304 debates are
    relevant for food safety, where Research & Innovation will need to support a systems
    change, in ways to deliver enough safe food to feed a growing world population.
    Considering the UN Sustainable Development Goals and citizens’ requests for sustainable
    and safe food, regulatory science will need to support sustainable food systems
    by assessing the safety and efficacy of innovation in the food chain. The 7th
    Environment Action Programme (EAP)5 formulated an inspiring forward-looking vision:
    ‘In 2050, we live well, within the planet''s ecological limits. Our prosperity
    and healthy environment stem from an innovative, circular economy where nothing
    is wasted and where natural resources are managed sustainably, and biodiversity
    is protected, valued and restored in ways that enhance our society''s resilience.
    …’. Furthermore, research needs identified in the ‘JRC report on delivering on
    EU food safety and nutrition in 2050’ (Mylona et al., 2016) have informed this
    paper. Recent discussions and statements, including the ‘Lamy Report’6 and the
    Tallinn Call for Action,7 call for better alignment with EU/national R&I investments
    and facilitate collaborative approaches. The interim evaluation of the H2020 research
    programme found that more attention needs to be given to make sure research delivers
    impact. Therefore, our research priorities do not stop strictly at the borders
    of risk assessment but consider the full risk analysis framework to ensure that
    research and innovation indeed can deliver the desired innovation and impact on
    science and society. Innovation is important to EFSA''s work, for example, when
    performing safety assessments of regulated products in food, feed and the environment,
    to be able to assess novel products in a pre-market phase (e.g. synthetic biology,
    nanotechnology). Therefore, we choose to formulate broad research streams, showing
    the interconnectivity and impact on science and society, under which we brought
    together the more specific research themes and topics from the consultations.
    The ten research themes and underlying topics from the consultations are listed
    in Annex 3. Other important developments that influenced the formulation of these
    research needs include the cooperation with other EU Agencies and the Risk Assessment
    Research Assembly (RARA).8 In February 2018, EFSA convened policymakers and the
    wider scientific community (200 participants from 39 countries) to discuss research
    priorities and ideas (EFSA, 2018). On this occasion, EFSA''s Advisory Forum highlighted
    the mutual benefits of increased interaction between funders, EU agencies and
    national partners on food safety research,9 to enable: access to expert networks
    in Member States (MS), pre-accession and neighbourhood countries avoid duplication/redundancy
    in research efforts strengthen the science/policy interface and help research
    to deliver impact exploit outcomes of research projects and provide sustainable
    follow-up disseminate research results: engage regulators, public bodies, civil
    society. EFSA performs regulatory science, assessing the latest science to inform
    policy decisions, and operates a large network in and beyond Europe. EFSA actively
    works with many partners to exchange data, information, expertise and staff, through
    our Advisory Forum and 375 competent organisations, including public authorities,
    universities and research organisations. EFSA coordinates 16 scientific networks
    with representatives from all MS and is active in several international networks
    and liaison groups, such as the Global Coalition for Regulatory Science Research.10
    In response to the call for coordination in the area of food safety research at
    the RARA event, where participants called on EFSA to be a knowledge-broker between
    scientists and policy makers, EFSA established a Research Platform (http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/engage/research-platform)
    on its website that is home for the wider food safety research community, aiming
    to support project ideas, promote consortia formation, and help scientists find
    opportunities for food safety research funding. EFSA works closely together with
    the EU Agencies Network for Scientific Advice (EU–ANSA)11 that provide scientific
    advice to EU policymakers. This network recently published a reflection paper
    (EU-ANSA, 2018) that proposes actions to enhance the added value of EU agencies
    to EU research actors and policymakers in the EU institutions, by engaging more
    actively in the research knowledge cycle. One such action for EU Agencies is to
    be more actively involved in shaping and informing research agendas. In order
    to inform research agendas, this paper presents, in the following tables, three
    research streams bringing together the main research needs and priorities in support
    of food safety risk assessment in the coming years. These Food Safety Regulatory
    Research Needs for 2030 should be useful when developing Safe Food Systems of
    the future as well as EFSA''s Strategy for 2027. 1. SAFE FOOD SYSTEMS Improve
    food safety while moving towards alternative and sustainable production systems
    This research stream shall consider impacts on food safety of innovation in food
    production and food systems. Risk assessment operates at the science–policy interface,
    informing decision- and policy-making and food safety is integral part of food
    and nutrition security. For food systems to be safe, it does not suffice to assess
    risks, but also benefits, impacts and alternatives need to be assessed and put
    into the equation. This should be done at processing level as well as primary
    production level, hence animal and plant health issues need to be considered.
    Dietary prevention strategies focusing on energy or single nutrients have generally
    failed and should be broadened. Themes Impact Food Risk Analysis Capacity Widening
    the EU food risk analysis capacity to incorporate risk-benefits in the socio-economic
    analysis of alternative and sustainable production systems Increased EU capacity
    for Agri-Food Technology impact assessment to anticipate impacts of food safety
    interventions Reduce, Replace, Re-organise across the food chain Primarily aimed
    at reducing the impacts of pesticide use on human health and the environment by
    alternative approaches Stimulate innovation by developing and introducing non-chemical
    alternatives such as microorganisms used as Plant Protection Products (PPP) Understand
    the influence of soil and ecosystems for alternative and sustainable production
    systems Ensure food, feed, nutrition security Consider the continuum of food safety
    & food and nutrition security Support food sustainability through safe agricultural
    and aquaculture practices Quicker detection of food fraud through improved surveillance
    Smarter methods to responsibly deal with food, including reduction of waste Anticipate
    the impact of socio-demographic and consumer trends on food availability, product
    reformulation and dietary patterns Establish the public health impact of food
    fortification Ensuring nutritional health through understanding and acceptance
    of science-based dietary guidelines Shift attention towards overall dietary patterns
    and role of specific foods on disease prevention Impact of new technologies on
    food production and circular economy Ability to assess impact of new technologies
    on food production (e.g. emissions) and circular economy (e.g. reintroduction
    of food waste) Deliver tools to identify vulnerable systems for food production,
    susceptible to (multiple) pest and pathogens Development of novel foods and feeds
    and ensuring their safety, including the development of safe GMO-based plant and
    animal products Deliver methods for assessing the environmental impact of new
    technologies. Better preparedness through transdisciplinary analysis of threats
    to food safety, for migrant and indigenous populations Impact of social changes
    Anticipate how social changes (e.g. climate change, consumer choices, migration,
    personalised nutrition) drive changes in exposure patterns, and choices in diets
    that may constitute new hazards Support personalised nutrition, while providing
    an assessment of nutrient intake and nutritional status across different populations,
    including migrants 2. INNOVATION IN RISK ASSESSMENTAnticipating impact of innovations
    and new technologies on integrated risk assessment This research stream shall
    consider what impact new knowledge and tools may bring to risk assessment of food
    safety, so to be prepared for the future. The current risk assessment paradigm
    is challenged by recent scientific and technical advances, and public demands.
    The current approach is considered too resource-intensive, is mostly animal-based
    and can raise issues in terms of reproducibility and ethics. A paradigm shift
    is required to deliver testing strategies that enable reliable, animal-free hazard
    and risk assessments, which are based on a mechanistic understanding of chemical
    toxicity. Increasingly, we see that different compartments are interlinked, and
    understand the importance of a OneHealth approach. Themes Impact Integrated approaches
    for chemical and microbiological hazards and antimicrobial resistance Apply an
    integrated risk assessment approach on chemical and biological hazards including
    social and environmental factors based on a ‘One Health’ approach Have means to
    identify emerging chemical and biological risks at global level and propose prevention
    strategies Identify potential hazards associated with antibiotic resistant species
    present in food of non-animal origin and the environment Using standardised and
    validated analytical and sequencing methodologies and tailored tools to use Whole
    Genome Sequencing (WGS) analysis for risk assessment purposes Integration of molecular
    data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics) in microbiological
    risk assessment Integrating new technologies in risk and safety assessment New
    methodologies: integrated non-animal testing, integrated exposure assessment,
    new approach methodologies based on in silico and in vitro approaches, mechanistic
    information (e.g. Adverse Outcome Pathway, impact of regulated products) Facilitate
    the paradigm shift in terms of gathering/accessing new data and re-engineering/making
    better use of available ones Develop approaches to assess the health relevance
    of changes in the microbiome Incorporate knowledge from interindividual variabilities
    in metabolism and susceptibility in population-based assessment Integrating new
    knowledge in risk and safety assessment To have measures from biomonitoring, microbiome
    and exposome analysis that reflects consumer ‘real life’ exposure To develop methodologies
    for the safety assessment of the combined exposure and effect of multiple chemicals
    in food To integrate knowledge generated by the new technologies into risk assessment
    and regulatory processes Integrated approaches to pests and diseases in plants
    and animal production Have a holistic approach on assessing the environmental
    impact of farming practices, crop threats (e.g. plant pests and diseases, climate
    change effects as droughts, floods etc.) and threat mitigation measures (e.g.
    PPP, resistant plant varieties, fertilisers, irrigation, etc.) to biodiversity
    and ecosystem services Integrating outcomes of human and environmental risk assessment
    Have indicators for ‘chemical, microbial and overall safety’ of food products,
    and for sustainability of ‘safe food production’ Have a systems approach to environmental
    risk assessment Understand the dynamics of micro-/nano-plastics in food chain
    and impacts on health Develop landscape-based environmental scenarios for non-target
    organisms and the impact of regulated stressors Ability to assess safety and human
    and environmental impact of technologies such as nanomaterials and synthetic biology
    Develop tools to consider protein toxicity and allergenicity 3. HOLISTIC RISK
    ASSESSMENTUnderstanding the context and delivering and communicating impactful
    science Holistic risk assessment uses insights from society, explores the use
    of latest technologies and relies on outstanding scientific expertise. Coupled
    with evidence-based risk communication, these elements allow delivery of impactful
    scientific advice meeting expectations of citizens. This research stream will
    focus on understanding the societal context in which science is delivered, as
    well as how that science can be strengthened - through the use of big data and
    innovative tools in the risk assessment process and by building a generation of
    experts who are able to use evidence from different disciplines. To understand
    the context, research will focus on understanding citizens’ awareness, perceptions
    and behaviour, integrate risks and benefits, while at the same time promoting
    education and mobility of experts to acquire transdisciplinary expertise. Themes
    Impact Social research to understand citizens’ awareness, perceptions and behaviour
    in the area of food safety Insights from social research will help identify right
    timing and adequate methods of engaging with society during the risk assessment
    process Understanding citizen''s perceptions will inform risk communication which,
    on evidence-base, will employ a tailored approach to meet the information needs
    of target audiences Improvements to the way science is communicated will contribute
    to accountability and trustworthiness of regulatory bodies Traditional quantitative
    and qualitative methods will be complemented with tools such as social media analysis,
    or community-based monitoring Integrated risk-benefit assessment To develop and
    apply methodologies for the combined effects of risks and benefits into one overall
    assessment, using the same denominator (e.g. Disability Adjusted Life Years, cost-of-illness)
    To develop and apply cost-benefit assessment methodologies to assess costs associated
    with preventing risks and/or establishing benefits To develop and apply methodologies
    for risk-risk comparisons and risk-ranking To develop and apply methodologies
    for communicating on and informing risk-managers on risk-benefit assessments,
    cost-benefit assessments, risk–risk comparisons and risk ranking endeavours Tools
    for data-driven food systems Ability to use crowdsourcing, operate real-time monitoring
    and signal alerts with help of appropriate big data analytical platforms to assess
    effectiveness of interventions Improving tools and approaches in exposure assessment
    Open and interoperable data from various domains to support risk assessment Benefits
    of using blockchain technology along the food chain, including for supply chain
    monitoring and potential prevention of food fraud Artificial Intelligence and
    machine learning Intensified cooperation with wider society and value provided
    by society for risk assessment through the use of Artificial Intelligence (primarily
    focused on machine learning) by real time analysis of big data (incl. Internet
    of Things) Increased efficiency (in terms of time and human resources) in the
    data-to-evidence process (search, appraise, integrate) Building capacity for future
    transdisciplinary expertise Training programmes will widen scientist''s knowledge
    and provide hands-on experience in risk assessment and communication The mobility
    nature of the programme will ensure familiarity with different disciplines, for
    experts to acquire transdisciplinary expertise Educate next generation experts

    Get rights and content Highlights • First literature review paper of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management. • Four applications of blockchain
    technology are identified. • Six challenges for applying blockchain technology
    are identified. • Research gaps and future research directions are proposed. Abstract
    Agri-food value chain is an area of significant importance because of providing
    sustainable, affordable, safety and sufficient food, feed, fibre and fuel to consumers,
    it is critical to ensure these value chains running smoothly and successfully
    by applying advanced internet technologies. Blockchain technology is a new digital
    technological approach underpinned by the Industry 4.0 to ensuring data integrity
    and preventing tampering and single point failure through offering fault-tolerance,
    immutability, trust, transparency and full traceability of the stored transaction
    records to all agri-food value chain partners. This paper used systematic literature
    network analysis to review the state-of-the-art blockchain technology including
    its recent advances, main applications in agri-food value chain and challenges
    from a holistic perspective. The findings suggest that blockchain technology together
    with advanced information and communication technology and internet of things
    have been adopted for the improvement of agri-food value chain management in four
    main aspects: traceability, information security, manufacturing and sustainable
    water management. Six challenges have been identified including storage capacity
    and scalability, privacy leakage, high cost and regulation problem, throughput
    and latency issue, and lack of skills. Based on the critical analysis of literature,
    research gaps and future research directions are proposed in this paper regarding
    the applications and challenges of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    management. This study makes contributions to the extant literature in the field
    of agri-food value chain management by discovering the potential of blockchain
    technology and its implications for agri-food value chain performance improvements
    such as food safety, food quality and food traceability. Previous article in issue

    1. Introduction The agri-food value chain is a complex system responsible for
    the circulation of agri-food products from the initial stage of production to
    the final stage of consumption. In the circulation process, value chain members
    play a critical role in meeting the consumers’ demand for agri-food products and
    maintaining the quality and safety of products [1]. Simultaneously, with the rapid
    development of internet technologies in the value chain area, a large number of
    emerging technologies such as advanced information and communication technology
    (ICT) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have been applied to the agri-food value
    chain [46]. However, almost all the systems applied to the agri-food value chain
    are centralised, monopolistic, asymmetric and opaque, and may result in serious
    trust problem. Therefore, consumers’ confidence towards food safety has been broken
    after a series of food safety risk incidents and scandals over the last decades
    [46], such as mad cow disease, horsemeat scandal [2], toxic milk powder, genetically
    modified food and trench oil [3]. Consequently, detailed information of agri-food
    products from farm to fork is increasingly requested by consumers. Furthermore,
    how to build fault-tolerance, immutability, trust, transparency and full traceability
    of agri-food value chain [4], regulations and customers’ expectations towards
    food quality and food safety [5], the complexity of agri-food value chain [6],
    and the current applications of technologies and their potential issues/pitfalls
    [7] have attracted increasing attention from academics and practitioners. A potential
    solution to alleviate the above issues and concerns is usage of blockchain technology,
    which is a new digital technological approach underpinned by the Industry 4.0
    to ensuring data integrity and preventing tampering and any single point failure.
    Four special elements - decentralised, immutable, consensus, and democratic that
    are unique to blockchain networks that make the technology more attractive in
    promoting trust and transparency in the agri-food value chain fraught with errors,
    duplication and redundancies [68]. Crosby et al. [8] underlines that blockchain
    is essentially a distributed database system that records transactional data or
    other digital events that have been executed and shared among value chain participants.
    It enables agri-food value chain participants to establish a decentralized consensus
    on the sequence of events and the current status of the transaction [9]. Blockchain
    technology uses a combination of different technologies that have been applied
    in computer science such as public/private key cryptography, cryptographic hash
    functions and database technologies [10], which provides an innovative solution
    to achieve food traceability, transparency, safety and security [11]. Two prominent
    benefits of blockchain technology are that it provides a permanent transaction
    records which are grouped into individual blocks and cannot be tampered with;
    and it can replace those traditional paper tracking systems and manual monitoring
    systems, so as to prevent the traditional way of the value chain from suffering
    the inaccurate impact [39]. The academic interest in investigating the application
    of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management has been progressively
    expanded, with a rapid increase in the contributions of academic experts covering
    this aspect [[11], [12], [13],38]. Moreover, blockchain technology used in the
    agri-food value chain seems to be a promising research stream for future research,
    especially in the era of Industry 4.0 [14,83]. However, only a limited number
    of studies analyse the current applications and future research directions of
    blockchain technology in different industries. We found three reviews concerned
    with the blockchain technology and its impact on the social and economy, drawn
    up, respectively, by Anascavage and Davis [15], who identified 16 areas that blockchain
    technology could be applied to, including food security; Tama et al. [16] acknowledge
    four areas that blockchain technology has been applied to and considers that blockchain
    technology plays an important role in guaranteeing the traceability of the agri-food
    value chain; and finally Yli-Huumo et al. [17] conducted a systematic literature
    review (SLR) on current research of blockchain technology including security,
    wasted resources, usability and privacy. These reviews are, however, relatively
    general, and given the current research and applications of blockchain technology,
    none of the reviews addresses the application of the blockchain technology in
    the agri-food value chain management. Therefore, there is a lack of up-to-date
    reviews that offer a comprehensive overview of the main issues related to current
    applications, challenges and future research directions of the blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain management. Considering the above arguments, the
    main objective of this study is to fill this gap by offering a systematic literature
    network analysis (SLNA) of the recent contributions of blockchain technology in
    the agri-food value chain management, highlighting the research that has been
    developed over time, and identifying the challenges of applying blockchain technology
    to the agri-food value chain management, and proposing the most promising research
    directions for the future. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.
    The methodology adopted in this paper is described in Section 2, while the application
    of the research methodology to the context under study is provided in Section
    3. Then, the current applications of blockchain technology in the agri-food value
    chain management are presented in Section 4 followed by the challenges for applying
    blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain that are presented in Section
    5. The research gaps and proposed future research directions are presented in
    Section 6. Finally, conclusions and research limitations are drawn in Section
    7. 2. Research methodology: systematic literature network analysis Systematic
    literature network analysis (SLNA) is constituted with two methods: systematic
    literature review (SLR) and citation network analysis (CNA). The purpose of integrating
    these two existing methodologies (SLR and CNA) is to maximize the advantages related
    to each of them: SLR provides a reproducible and rigorous method that is applied
    in this study to select the most relevant and high-quality studies from previous
    literature of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. Through
    synthesising of the literatures, the state-of-the-art of applications and the
    challenges to apply blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    will be revealed. Simultaneously, why blockchain technology matters in agri-food
    value chain management is also disclosed. CNA offers an evidence-based approach
    to identifying the most-cited studies from the selected databases, revealing the
    contributions on blockchain technology theory building in the agri-food value
    chain management as well as suggesting future research directions that can facilitate
    the application of the blockchain technology to the agri-food value chain management
    [18]. The process of SLNA from the combination of SLR and CNA is shown in Fig.
    A1. 3. Applying the SLNA to the area under study The process of how to apply SLNA
    to the area of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management is described
    in the following five sub-sections. 3.1. Formulating the research questions The
    first stage of conducting SLNA is to formulate research questions. It is important
    to have well-specified, informative and clearly formulated research questions
    to avoid bias, error and ambiguity [19]. Therefore, the research questions were
    formulated based on the following process: (1) Brainstorming all types of applications
    of blockchain technology that can be used in agri-food value chain management;
    (2) Consulting with three experts in academia and agri-food industry to evaluate
    whether it is possible to apply the blockchain technology in these areas; (3)
    Examining possible applications of blockchain technology that can be applied to
    the agri-food value chain management. Based on the above processes and principles,
    the following research questions were formulated: RQ1. What are the main applications
    of blockchain technology that have been developed in agri-food value chain management?
    RQ2. What are the key challenges for applying blockchain technology to agri-food
    value chain management? RQ3. What are the research gaps and future research directions
    for applying blockchain technology to agri-food value chain management? 3.2. Locating
    study Denyer and Tranfield [20] proposed that a comprehensive list of core contributions
    is necessary to answer the review questions by searching the most relevant and
    high-quality studies. Eight databases were selected for literature search, including
    ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, Taylor & Francis Online, Wiley Online Library,
    Emerald, Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore. The rationale for selecting these databases
    is that they include the top science and technology journals, conference proceedings
    and business research journals. Consistent with other SLR papers in blockchain
    technology (e.g. [17,21,22]), the identified keywords were used as the search
    criteria in our review. Since the aim of this research is to identify the main
    issues relating to the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain management, a combination of “blockchain” and “agri-food value chain management”,
    with all the related terms were used for searching the title, keywords and abstract
    in the selected electronic academic databases. These keywords were combined later
    through Boolean connectors to constitute different search strings to be applied
    in the databases. Furthermore, consultation with various practitioners and academics
    in the relevant field was conducted to confirm whether search strings were also
    necessary. Finally, a total of 45 search strings were identified by the authors
    to be included in the search process. A full list of search strings is shown in
    Table 1. Table 1. Search strings for databases search. Keywords “blockchain”,
    “information security”, “information transparency”, “agriculture”, “agricultural”,

    OR “food value chain management” OR “agriculture value chain management” OR “agri-food
    value chain management” OR “agriculture trade”) 3.3. Study selection and evaluation
    As a very recent and new research area, as discussed earlier, the term of blockchain
    technology was first coined in 2008 [16]. In fact, the idea of blockchain technology
    was hardly discussed before 2008. Therefore, we use the year 2008 as the starting
    point to search relevant publications. Further, to find more relevant and important
    studies to be included in the analysis, various reference types such as journal
    papers, conference papers and book chapters were included in the systematic review.
    Simultaneously, the identification of key articles and book chapters that provide
    background information on blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    were found from different sources, including colleagues working in the same field.
    The initial search with the specified keywords and open access in the selected
    eight databases from 2008 to 2018 resulted in a preliminary sample of 632 contributions.
    Afterwards, each study was checked by three authors by carefully analysing the
    abstracts, introductions and conclusions to reduce any subjective bias and enhance
    validity. Moreover, relevant book chapters and other publications that were not
    covered by the databases were then identified through carefully searching the
    references used in the previous literature (e.g. [17,21,22]). The review of the
    work of influential authors in the field of blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain management was also carried out by the same three authors. A series
    of inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to include/exclude papers (Table
    2), which were built through a brainstorming session among these three authors.
    Studies that do not meet the inclusion criteria or duplicates or non-relevant
    studies were eliminated. As a result, 62 studies were finally selected. Table
    2. Criteria for inclusion or exclusion studies. Inclusion criteria Rationale Articles
    were published in peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings and book chapters
    in English Peer-reviewed journals, conference papers and book chapters are considered
    to have better quality than non-peer-reviewed articles Articles were published
    between 2008 and 2018 The year 2008 was selected as the starting point as the
    term blockchain was coined in 2008 [16] The selected articles contain at least
    one keyword in their title or abstract Abstract or title focusing on the applications
    of blockchain technology was selected Judge relevance by fully reading all remaining
    abstract, introduction and conclusion The remaining abstract, introduction and
    conclusion focusing on the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain were selected Judge relevance by fully reading all remaining articles
    Articles focusing on the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain were selected All selected 62 studies were read entirely by the three authors
    independently. By cross-referencing all the citations and references and talking
    with experts in the experts from academia and the agri-food industry, nine additional
    studies were identified and added, resulting in a total of 71 academic peer-reviewed
    journal papers, conference papers and book chapters to be included in the analysis.
    The search and selection process is presented in Fig. A2. 3.4. Citation network
    analysis (CNA) CNA is an effective and efficient way to reveal the articles that
    represent the basis of the field and to identify which articles were used by many
    other authors for the development of their contributions [18]. The citation data
    (author, title, year, cited reference, source, time cited etc.) were collected
    from the Web of Science Core collection. Then, the software Gephi was used to
    build a citation network among the selected studies. Gephi is the leading visualization
    and exploration software for all graphs and networks, which can be applied to
    six main areas such as exploratory data analysis, link analysis, social network
    analysis, biological network analysis, and poster creation [23]. The rationale
    for this choice is that Gephi can provide large information handling capacity,
    friendly graphical user interface and high-quality output formats [24]. As shown
    in Fig. 1, a network consisting of 71 nodes was constructed. It comprises 47 connected
    components and 24 isolated components. Download : Download high-res image (822KB)

    studies. Note: Node size depends on the quantity of connected components. From
    the Fig. 1, we can see that the connected components were divided into seven clusters
    according to their citation information. For example, the orange cluster summarized
    the opportunities that blockchain technology could be applied in agri-food value
    chain management such as blockchain combined with IoT to be used in agri-food
    value chain, as well as used in agri-food value chain traceability. It is important
    to note that most of the papers included in this cluster were literature review
    papers [17,25,26]. A detailed analysis of benefits, opportunities and challenges
    of integrating blockchain technology with IoT were discussed in the cluster of
    black. There were four clusters (Light green, purple, red and blue) mainly discussed
    how to use blockchain technology to increase the agri-food value chain traceability
    and manufacturing conceptually and empirically. Simultaneously, different traceability
    models were proposed and tested. Finally, the green cluster represents how blockchain
    along with other technologies such as Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
    Internet of Things served as an engine of the 4th industrial revolution, and how
    these technologies can revolutionize the current agri-food value chain management
    [27,28]. The detailed information of each cluster is shown in Table 3. Table 3.

    has gained increasing attention from researchers and practitioners, in 2016 Yli-Huumo
    et al. [17] proposed an SLR on blockchain technology by highlighting current research
    topics, challenges and future research directions from a technological perspective.
    Their research results indicate four research gaps existing in the current study:
    (1) Lack of high-quality journal papers, most of the papers are published in conferences,
    symposiums and workshops; (2) The majority of current research is conducted in
    Bitcoin environment, rather than in other blockchain environments; (3) Lack of
    research on usability; (4) No research on the challenges for applying blockchain
    technology, such as latency, throughput and bandwidth. Following Yli-Huumo et
    al. [17], a series of research articles attempt to fill the research gaps. Tian
    [38] and Faye [39] have explored the field of blockchain technology in the context
    of the agri-food value chain from a traceability perspective. The issue addressed
    is how to embed blockchain technology in the current traceability system to increase
    the transparency and security of the agri-food value chain. With the evolution
    of research in the blockchain-based traceability system, some researchers tried
    to examine some generic models for facilitating the development of blockchain-based
    traceability system, such as the “TRADE” model proposed by Maouchi et al. [36].
    Concerns about integrating blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain
    need to be addressed from a single company perspective firstly, therefore, Hamida
    et al. [40] provided a detailed analysis on enterprise blockchains of its applications,
    challenges and opportunities. It is interesting to note that within these studies,
    the paper An agri-food supply chain traceability system for China based on RFID
    & blockchain technology proposed by Tian [38] is the most frequently cited paper,
    which has been cited 16 times by other authors among the selected papers (Table
    4). At the current stage of research in blockchain technology for traceability,
    most researchers (e.g. [[38], [39], [40]]) considered blockchain technology as
    a competitive advantage for agriculture value chain participants to gain trust
    from customers. Finally, most of these articles focus on addressing blockchain-based
    traceability system from the perspective of conceptual development. Table 4. Most

    of research examines how to combine blockchain technology with the IoT that can
    be applied in agri-food value chain management. Christidis and Devetsikiotis [41]
    noted that the combination of blockchain technology with IoT would allow agri-food
    value chain participants to get automated time-consuming workflows in a new and
    unique way, as well as to reduce significant costs in the process. Following Christidis
    and Devetsikiotis [41], many researchers have tried to contribute the theory-building
    of integrating blockchain technology with IoT from different perspectives. Hammi
    et al. [49] explored how to improve trust relationship among agri-food value chain
    members by designing a blockchain-IoT application. Reyna et al. [50] investigated
    how blockchain technology could potentially improve the IoT. Finally, Davcev et
    al. [30] proposed a blockchain-based distributed cloud/fog platform for IoT to
    enable grape value chain. The research trends on blockchain-based IoT has been
    from generally discussing the challenges and opportunities for combining blockchain
    technology with IoT to how to design a blockchain-based IoT system for solving
    the trust issues among agri-food value chain members, which facilitate to build
    a distributed peer-to-peer systems to interact with agri-food value chain participants
    in a trust and auditable manner. The trends towards stricter rules on food safety
    and food quality leads some researchers to explore potential applications of blockchain
    technology in other fields of agri-food value chain management, such as how to
    apply blockchain technology in food manufacturing [43] and how to use blockchain
    technology to increase the water sustainability [59]. Regarding the performance
    of applying blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain management, just
    a few papers measure the performance from the perspective of reducing tracking
    time to improve the traceability [4] and increasing the efficiency of the traceability
    in the agri-food value chain [13]. Simultaneously, several literature review papers
    investigated how blockchain technology has been applied in different industries
    such as agri-food industry, financial service and healthcare [8,16]. They provide
    insights on the development of blockchain technology in different industries and
    facilitate researchers to investigate how to transfer the knowledge from theory
    to practice. 3.5. Thematic analysis Braun and Clarke [51] stated that “thematic
    analysis is a method for identifying, analysing and reporting patterns (themes)
    within data, which provides core skills that will be useful for conducting many
    other forms of qualitative analysis”. Holloway and Todres [52] underlined that
    thematic analysis can be seen as a foundational approach for qualitative analysis.
    In this paper, thematic analysis was used to allow blockchain themes being generated
    by six phases of analysis: reading the whole paper collected from SLR, generating
    initial codes, searching for themes, reviewing themes, defining and naming themes,
    and finally presenting the results. Following the process of thematic analysis,
    we divided the literature of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    based on the following themes: (1) current applications of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management; (2) the challenges for applying the blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management. The detailed results from thematic
    analysis are presented in Section 4. Tama et al. [16] conducted a literature review
    on the blockchain technology and its current applications, where the majority
    of literature was concerned with the blockchain technology theory building and
    conceptual development. However, the findings in our study show that the trend
    has been gradually shifted from theory building trying to use blockchain technology
    in practice. Although the number of studies on how blockchain technology can be
    used in agri-food value chain management is increasing, there are a limited number
    of studies on how blockchain technology can be executed. 4. Current applications
    of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management The first application
    of the blockchain technology was Bitcoin – a peer-to-peer electronic cash system
    [53]. Then, blockchain technology evolved towards smart contracts with the ability
    to provide transparency and trust to the system [41]. A smart contract is a kind
    of computer program that stores on the blockchain and executes by all consensus
    nodes in the network. It can translate contractual clauses into code and store
    them into the storage file, and operate them automatically and independently in
    a prescribed manner based on the data that was included in the triggering transaction
    [54]. Through operating the smart contracts, the need for trusted intermediaries
    between partners can be minimized and the occurrence of malicious or accidental
    exceptions can be reduced. Thus, blockchain technology has been generalized and
    applied in different domains such as finance [55], smart city [56], healthcare
    [57] and agri-food value chain [43]. However, as reviewed by Yli-Huumo et al.
    [17], more than 80% of the academic papers on blockchain technology focused on
    the Bitcoin system, while less than 20% deal with other blockchain applications.
    Although it is a relatively new technology, blockchain is rapidly advancing and
    developing. Lucena et al. [58] stated that there was a huge opportunity for blockchain
    applications to global trade. Blockchain market is estimated to grow from 210.2
    million USD to 2312.5 million USD in the period from 2016 to 2021 based on the
    Global Opportunity Report [90]. Due to its potential increase in the global market,
    it is expected that blockchain technology will play a critical role in facilitating
    future industry development and revolution. However, Poberezhna [59] argued that
    the key challenge for blockchain was to be considered as a simply disruptive technology,
    rather than as an innovative integrative solution that could provide a value proposition
    across a number of business process. In the following four sub-sections, we analyse
    the literature of the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain management by classifying them in four distinctive themes: traceability,
    information security, manufacturing and sustainable water management. 4.1. Applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain traceability According to Murki
    [60], different value chains need to embed blockchain technology in the current
    traceability system to create more agile value chains and closer customer relationship.
    Tse et al. [11] hold a similar view that the application of blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain may have been the optimal choice to fulfil the requirements
    of supervision and adaption of the fast-growing food market. More specifically,
    Kumar and Mallick [61] construe that blockchain technology has wider applications
    in agri-food value chain such as food delivery and shipping data records, food
    online ordering and transaction data, and food quality assurance data. To integrate
    blockchain technology in the existing traceability system of agri-food value chain,
    many researchers have tried to explore the options from different perspectives.
    Tian [38] proposed an agri-food value chain traceability system based on RFID
    (Radio-Frequency IDentification) and blockchain technology for helping Chinese
    agri-food markets to enhance their food safety and food quality during the logistics
    process. In their proposed traceability system, RFID was used for acquiring and
    sharing data in the agri-food value chain, meanwhile, blockchain technology was
    used for guaranteeing the data shared and published in this traceability system
    is reliable and authentic. However, some researchers argue that RFID technology
    and blockchain based traceability system has some defects in solving the counterfeit
    issues. For example, RFID tags can be cloned which can cause counterfeit parts
    to be circulated in the agri-food value chain [62]. To overcome the drawbacks
    of RFID, Boehm et al. [37] proposed an updated traceability system using blockchain
    technology combined with Near Field Communication (NFC) and verified users. In
    their proposed traceability system, users must provide valid user credentials
    if they want to update a product’s history on the blockchain. Thus, various changes
    of an agri-food product can be reported, and the capabilities of other members
    can be restricted at the same time. Therefore, holistic tracking agri-food products
    with higher transparency and security can be achieved. Faye [39] underlined that
    the application of blockchain technology in agri-food industry would foster more
    transparency and thus customers’ confidence towards agri-food products would be
    re-established. Although blockchain technology has great potential for revolutionizing
    current agri-food value chain traceability systems, it still has some inherent
    defects such as scalability that needs to be tackled, especially when we face
    mass data in the real world. Recent innovations in blockchain, such as scaling
    would change this working manner that requires every computer in the blockchain
    to process every transaction [63]. Croman et al. [64] argued that a scaled blockchain
    could accelerate the transaction process, without sacrificing high security, by
    determining the optimal number of computers to validate each transaction and divide
    work efficiently. Therefore, Tian [46] investigated a value chain traceability
    system based on HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point), blockchain
    technology and IoT. In their proposed new decentralized traceability system, HACCP
    was used to prevent food risk occurrences, and IoT combined with blockchain technology
    was used to continuously deliver massive real-time food-related information to
    all value chain partners in an effective, safe and efficient manner. Then, a case
    testing experiment was used to check whether the system was feasible or not. The
    research results indicate that food safety, value chain efficiency and transparency
    have been effectively improved. Badzar [65] emphasizes that openness and unchangeable
    attributes of blockchain ensure high transparency, stability and reliability of
    agri-food value chain, as well as provide liquidity, more accurate record-keeping
    and high transparency of ownership [66]. To have deep understanding of knowledge
    on how blockchain technology can be used to enhance agri-food business, Rabah
    [28] conducted a review on the applications of big data and blockchain technology
    in the agri-food industry. Their research results reveal that blockchain technology
    played a critical role in creating secure and transparent ledger that was available
    to all the involved participants within the agri-food value chain including the
    producers, manufacturers, logistics service providers, wholesalers, retailers
    and regulators. They provide insights into the effects of blockchain technology
    on the current traceability system, and facilitate the development of blockchain
    technology in the agri-food value chain management. Finally, Biswas et al. [67]
    propose a blockchain based wine value chain traceability system where every transaction
    is recorded as a block in the chain and is visible to relevant value chain members
    such as the grape grower, wine producer, bulk distributor, transit cellar, filler/packer,
    finished goods distributor, wholesaler and retailer entity. One of the most important
    features of their proposed system is that anyone can trace the purchase history
    of the wine by inputting the product ID in the system. However, their work just
    examines an example, rather than a practical application of blockchain technology
    in the wine value chain. Maouchi et al. [36] argue that although various approaches
    have been proposed to create a decentralized traceability system for agri-food
    value chain, these works do not state the feasibility of their work and their
    application for the agri-food value chain. Due to the great potential benefits
    of applying blockchain technology to agri-food value chain traceability system,
    several agricultural industry enterprises around the world have evaluated the
    effect of blockchain technology. For example, Walmart plans to invest $25 million
    over five years from 2017 to establish one food safety collaboration centre in
    Beijing to build a completely new food traceability system with blockchain technology.
    Their mango blockchain solution pilots reduced the time for tracking mango origins
    from seven days to 2.2 s, thus, more transparency and greater efficiency have
    been achieved in Walmart’s food value chain. Then, a pork value chain traceability
    system combined with barcode has been built based on the mango blockchain solutions
    [13]. Yiannas [68] states that the biggest advantage of this system is that it
    allows any trusted users to verify the traceability and authenticity of the product
    at any point of the pork value chain. Despite the increasing emphasis on applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain traceability system, recent studies
    conducted by Kshetri [69] show that just a few researchers have begun to systematically
    assess the effects of blockchain technology on current agri-food value chain traceability
    system. Caro et al. [4] introduced an AgriBlockIoT traceability system for agri-food
    value chain management. It was constituted with three main components, a REST
    Application Interface with the responsibilities to integrate with the existing
    software system, a controller equipped with the abilities to query and convert
    the data records stored in the blockchain, and blockchain involved with smart
    contracts as a gateway to the blockchain itself. It is important to note that
    smart contracts can fire autonomously; hence creating records whenever anomalies
    are detected. Then, two different implementations, namely Ethereum and Hyperledger
    Sawtooth were used to do the performance analysis of traceability. Their research
    results indicate that Hyperledger Sawtooth has better performances than the Ethereum
    counterpart and may be more suitable for IoT devices, because Etherum is quite
    CPU-intensive. Based on the case study for grain quality assurance tracking, Lucena
    [58] finds out that quality measurement throughout the transportation for grains
    along the value chain is always accompanied with fraud, poor monitoring and delay
    to final destinations. Their findings indicate that using blockchain technology
    in the grain value chain traceability system is the best way at present to reduce
    disputes among business partners and information asymmetries. Finally, Kumar and
    Iyengar [70] demonstrated a blockchain based traceability framework for rice value
    chain management. In their proposed framework, blockchain was used to record all
    related issues happening within the rice value chain and monitor the security
    and quality of rice in the transportation process. It is important to note that
    all members in the rice value chain should register themselves and match their
    unique identities and digital profiles in the blockchain system. The research
    result indicates that the security of rice in the transportation process and the
    efficiency of the rice value chain have been greatly improved. 4.2. Applying blockchain
    technology in the agri-food value chain information security Under the background
    of Industry 4.0 and distributed computing, the characteristics of information
    system in agri-food industry have experienced substantial changes. Blockchain
    technology has inherent benefits such as recording transactions in real-time,
    no intermediary, immutability and distributed ledger, which becomes the first
    choice for agri-food value chain managers to enhance information security [60].
    Tse et al. [11] construed that blockchain was a well worthy technology for helping
    agri-food value chain participants to record and transfer transactions authentically.
    Leng et al. [1] proposed a public blockchain for agricultural value chain system
    along with double-chain architecture. The research results reveal that the proposed
    agricultural business resource blockchain not only can increase the security of
    transaction information and privacy of enterprise information, but also can enhance
    the credibility of the public service platform and facilitate overall increase
    of efficiency across the whole value chain system. Neisse et al. [71] explored
    a blockchain-based approach to achieve data accountability and provenance tracking.
    Their findings indicate that for the dynamic data frequently shared among value
    chain members such as the transaction record in agri-food value chain, which have
    strict scalability and performance requirements, controllers or processors should
    manage a contract that registers all subjects accepting all or part of usage conditions.
    Recently, with the advancement of IoT, machine-to-machine (M2M) connections is
    estimated to increase to 3.9 billion to 2022 [72]. More and more agri-food value
    chain participants are being equipped with interconnected electronic devices and
    protocol suites to increase the connectivity and sophisticated data gathering
    and analytics capabilities [50]. However, most of the IoT solutions are dependent
    on the centralized server-client paradigm, connecting to the cloud servers through
    the Internet [26]. Decentralised architectures such as building a large Peer-to-Peer
    (P2P) Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) may cause privacy and security issues to the
    users [73]. Thus, effective tools to ensure information security need to be supported
    by agri-food value chain participants to meet the requested security requirements.
    Currently, around 50% of agri-food practitioners have been experimenting blockchain
    technology with creating proof-of-concept, and 17% of agri-food practitioners
    have been preparing to deploy and use it in their business [74]. Hammi et al.
    [49] proposed a public blockchain-based approach in which devices can communicate
    with each other in a completely secure and efficient way by creating a secure
    virtual zone. After a series of tests, the research results indicate that the
    blockchain-based system demonstrated high resilience towards attacks. Iansiti
    and Lakhani [42] underlined that blockchain technology could provide secure, irreversible,
    distributed, transparent and accurate information sharing service. After conducting
    research on blockchain-based distributed cloud/fog platform for IoT, Davcev et
    al. [30] proposed that holistically using these blockchain-based ICT technologies
    has a positive effect in increasing the quality of agri-food products. 4.3. Applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food manufacturing In today’s highly competitive
    and knowledge-based economy, managing massive amount of information and services
    is the basic requirement for successful food manufacturers. As the information
    and services are diversified, growing in an accelerating velocity, and highly
    complex, an increase number of food manufacturers have difficulties in acquiring
    and managing them alone. Wang et al. [75] state that it is necessary for food
    manufacturers to work together and sustain their competitiveness. To address this
    issue, some researchers have started integrating blockchain concept into manufacturing
    practices. Li et al. [35] proposed a decentralized framework to manage the knowledge
    and services shared between different enterprises based on the blockchain application
    involved smart contracts and edge computing. In their proposed framework, edge
    computing acted as a foundation for providing distributed network, storage and
    computing capabilities in the manufacturing environment. The smart contracts played
    as interfaces between enterprise and its partners for successfully interact. Thus,
    a signed secure and controllable connection between the enterprise and the partner
    could be built with the transaction record and the status were updated on the
    blockchain. A case study was used to examine the effectiveness of the decentralized
    framework. The case study results indicate that manufacturers can develop scalable
    and flexible businesses at a lower cost, and ultimately the overall quality, efficiency,
    and effectiveness of manufacturing services can be improved. Furthermore, Zhao
    et al. [76], built a model of manufacturing service information based on blockchain
    principle and cloud computing, which theoretically solves the problems of sharing
    and securing the manufacturing resources, recalling the product data and guaranteeing
    the quality of the processing. Finally, Kumar and Mallic [61] reported that blockchain
    technology could be used in various perspectives of manufacturing, such as manufacturing
    management, production data, product warranty information and product assurance.
    Although blockchain technology has been seen as a critical element in the manufacturing
    sector in recent years, the role of blockchain technology for promoting resilience,
    scalability, security and autonomy of manufacturing service has been relatively
    overlooked [14]. 4.4. Applying blockchain technology in sustainable water management
    The agriculture productivity is highly dependent on water resource management.
    How to use water resources effectively and efficiently is crucial for agriculture
    development. To drive the sustainable development of water, it is critical to
    address water scarcity aspects that are deeply interrelated with agri-food development.
    Therefore, Civic Ledger [77] considered to develop a blockchain-enabled peer-to-peer
    trading platform (Water Ledger) that would allow more irrigators to participate
    in the platform that entitles and allocates water securely and transparently,
    further boosting the overall efficiency of water resources. Though creating new
    digital identity for irrigators and digitizing the water assets in agri-food value
    chain will cost a lot of money, Poberezhna [59] argues that blockchain combined
    with smart contracts can potentially help water companies and government bodies
    to access real-time data regarding market shares, consumption patterns and management
    of utility bills of consumers, thus, greater transparency to regulators and auditors
    can be achieved. Their research also indicates that recordkeeping will be significantly
    reduced when the blockchain platform is applied in water trading. 5. The challenges
    for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain Blockchain technology
    is still in testing phase and its implementation in agri-food value chain management
    has some issues that need to be tackled. Therefore, in this section, we will scrutinize
    the challenges to apply blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management.
    A review of the literature indicates that there are six main challenges for applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management: storage capacity and
    scalability issue, privacy leakage, regulation problem, high cost problem, throughput
    and latency issue, and lack of skills. 5.1. Storage capacity and scalability Storage
    capacity along with scalability issues have been deeply questioned in the blockchain.
    Koteska et al. [25] stated that one of the main challenges for blockchain implementation
    is scalability. To provide theoretically proven security, it is necessary to have
    a large number of full nodes (a node that can fully validate transactions and
    blocks) in the blockchain implementation. The nodes in the blockchain network
    are expected to validate each transaction of each block [50]. Otherwise, blockchain
    implementation in agri-food value chain management might result in a less decentralized
    system. Koteska et al. [25] proposed that scalability negatively affected three
    dimensions of the blockchain, the size of the data on the blockchain, the transaction
    processing rate and the latency of data transmission on the blockchain. Although
    only full nodes store the full chain, storage requirements are also significant
    [50]. For example of the Bitcoin, the blockchain is always growing with a rate
    of 1MB per block every ten minutes and store a large amount of data in every node
    that no interest for them [26]. As the number of transactions increase in the
    agri-food value chains, the amount of data becomes larger, and the loading of
    store and computing accompanied with data becomes harder, which results in the
    blockchain becoming bulky [78]. Simultaneously, every participant in the agri-food
    value chain needs to constantly store all transaction data to validate them on
    the blockchain because they need to check if the source of the current transaction
    is unspent or not [83]. Thus, with the node size increasing, additional resources
    are required by the nodes. Finally the system’s capacity scale is reduced and
    synchronization time for the new user is increased [50]. 5.2. Privacy leakage
    In the blockchain, each transaction can be traced, checked and audited and every
    user can be identified by their public key or its hash. Undoubtedly, blockchain
    technology provides a new level of transparency and helps to build trust. However,
    it also has negative effect on protecting users’ privacy [50]. Kosba et al. [79]
    stated that blockchain could not guarantee the transactional privacy even with
    the permission management because the information on blockchain was available
    to all participants who belonged to the blockchain network. Lu and Xu [80] underlined
    that every member could access all information on the blockchain because there
    were no privileged users. Maouchi et al. [36] argued that some agri-food value
    chain members might be competitors with each other and they did not enjoy the
    transparent traceability system. Therefore, many efforts for protecting privacy
    in blockchain has been done such as obfuscation on the transaction relationships
    to prevent linking or tracing analysis, hiding the identifies of the sender and
    the receiver through complicated cryptographic schemes, and blinding the transaction
    content whilst retaining the verifiability and computability [81]. In order to
    ensure transactions are not easily to be traced to any given person or computer,
    Monero [82] applies ring of signatures scheme to guarantee transactions untraceable.
    Other schemes such as Stealth Addresses, Pedersen Commitments, Ring Signature,
    Homomorphic Encryption, Zero-knowledge-proof have been used in blockchains to
    improve privacy, but no schemes can hide the sender, the receiver and the amount
    at the same time [40]. Kosba et al. [79] tackled these privacy issues differently
    through using encrypted transactions. The Hawk – a decentralized smart contract
    is responsible for translating the generic code written by programmers into cryptographic
    primitives such as zero-knowledge proofs that retaining transactional privacy.
    After researching in the wine value chain traceability system, Biswas et al. [67]
    stated that there were two drawbacks of the blockchain technology: one is the
    transaction speed; the other one is privacy as neither companies nor individuals
    would like to publish all information onto a public database. 5.3. High cost problem
    Lin and Liao [83] proposed that agri-food value chain participants would need
    a lot of money and time to embed blockchain technology in the current agri-food
    value chain traceability system. Yli-Huumo et al. [17] noted that when blockchain
    became more complex, the computational power would be another critical issue,
    as it required more computational power to confirm more blocks. Simultaneously,
    energy consumption also needs to be taken into consideration [39]. After conducting
    a case study on blockchain-based traceability system, Lu and Xu [80] pointed out
    some public blockchains inherent with a proof-of-work consensus mechanism wasted
    a lot of electricity. Most of the electricity is consumed in two different ways:
    (1) a large amount of electricity is used for the mining process, which involves
    a consensus algorithm that consists in a sort of brute force search for a hash;
    (2) another amount of electricity is consumed in peer-to-peer communications because
    it requires an edge device to be powered [26]. 5.4. Regulation problem Agri-food
    value chains are extended across the globe. Hence, applying blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management needs to be considered from a global perspective.
    However, blockchain is a new technology that involves different people from various
    countries without any legal or regulation to follow. Additionally, the absence
    of a central authority and the non-existent of censorship in the current blockchain
    system, this situation creates many uncertainties [50]. Atlam et al. [29] stated
    that this was a serious problem for both agri-food manufacturers and service providers.
    Therefore, it is necessary to introduce new laws or regulations to monitor and
    regulate blockchain applications in the agri-food industry for compliance [8].
    After conducting a case study on grain quality assurance tracking-based on blockchain
    technology, Lucena et al. [58] found a controversial issue when using blockchain
    technology regarding its legal value. Their research also indicates that complex
    agri-food value chain scenarios involving international trade and arbitration
    laws are yet to be proven. 5.5. Throughput and latency issue In the context of
    agri-food value chain management, due to the original restriction of block size
    and the time interval used to generate a new block, the current processing capacity
    of blokchain cannot fulfil the requirements of processing millions of transactions
    in real-time. Aste et al. [84] (p.26) stated that “a system that could handle
    large transaction volumes would require large blocks or mechanisms in which multiple
    blocks are validated simultaneously”. All the above issues will cause a big problem
    for clients when running a blockchain-based system. After investigating an RFID
    and blockchain based traceability system for agri-food value chain, Tian [38]
    stated that there were two obstacles for applying blockchain technology: (1) the
    transaction capacity of blockchain is restricted to seven transactions per second
    due to the restricted size of block; (2) how to deal with storage and synchronization
    issues with the growing size of the blockchain. Regarding latency, it is critical
    to note that current blockchain system needs some time to process transactions.
    For example, in the case of Bitcoin, block creation times follow a Poisson distribution
    with an average of ten minutes (10-minute block interval with 6-block confirmation)
    [26]. As for Ethereum, it is estimated around 3 min for 14-second block interval
    with 12-block confirmation [85]. Jindal et al. [86] construed that the time required
    for generating blocks and validating transactions is increases with an increase
    in the number of transactions. Sharma et al. [87] evaluated the performance of
    a blockchain-based distributed framework involved with Proof-of-Work algorithm
    and found that additional cost in computing sources and more processing time is
    required in case of network delays. 5.6. Lack of skills Given that blockchain
    is a new technology, a limited number of people have in-depth knowledge and skills
    about how blockchain can be used in agri-food value chain management [29]. To
    obtain general knowhow in blockchain technology and expectations of the technology
    in the context of agri-food value chain, Ge et al. [10] conducted numerous interviews
    and meetings with agri-food value chain stakeholders. They found that a considerable
    level of scepticism existed among stakeholders with low know-how of blockchain
    technology, partly due to the way blockchain was portrayed as panacea to all information
    problems, partly due to a series of technical issues that remained to be resolved.
    Therefore, Iansiti and Lakhani [42] proposed that applying blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain was likely to be a long process. Simultaneously,
    a widespread lack of understanding on how blockchain works in other areas also
    exists [88]. 6. Discussion: research gaps and future research directions Below,
    we summarized the research gaps and future research directions on blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management based on our systematic review of the literature.
    6.1. Future research directions for the applications of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management The analysis of the applications of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management allows us to better understand
    how blockchain technology has been applied and evolved in agri-food value chain
    management. Several directions for future research about implementing blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management are suggested and summarized in
    the following. • In the context of applying blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain traceability, various researchers proposed different blockchain-based
    traceability system that involved different technologies such as RFID, IoT, NFC,
    cloud computing, and big data, as well took different agri-food value chain entities
    into consideration (see Table 5). It is interesting to note that the traceability
    system proposed by Davcev et al. [30] could provide a comprehensive function for
    monitoring the land status, vegetable status, as well as to help to achieve the
    transparent and secure agri-food value chain. Therefore, should be implemented
    in reality. However, most of the proposed traceability systems are staying in
    conceptual phase and there is little empirical research to suggest which one is
    most applicable to the reality. Additionally, just few researchers considered
    third-party regulators/authority organizations in their proposed traceability
    framework. Therefore, one of the priorities for researching the blockchain-based
    traceability system is to conduct empirical research involving third-party regulators/authority
    organizations on different context of agri-food value chains to assess the performance
    of the blockchain-based traceability system. Thus, future studies can evaluate
    the proposed blockchain-based traceability framework effects from different perspectives,
    such as computation costs, transaction processing speed, storage capability, and
    the overall efficiency of agri-food value chains. Table 5. Blockchain technology

    in the agri-food supply chain can share the same business rules and transaction

    if involved in the international trade. • There are two main areas in the literature
    for using blockchain technology to improve agri-food value chain information security:
    one is using blockchain technology alone; the other one is using blockchain technology
    combined with other technologies such as IoT (see Table 6). Obviously, double
    blockchain architecture has it unique advantages such as efficiency, transparency
    and privacy can be achieved with more data can be stored in the blockchain. Key
    technical components such as decentralized storage, mining hardware, and consensus
    mechanisms are easily to be achieved. However, it needs more effective consensus
    mechanism to deal with large amount of nodes and resources that stored in public
    service platform. Therefore, future research should investigate which consensus
    algorithm is more effective compared with others (Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake,
    etc) in the same context. IoT applications have its own drawbacks such as they
    generate large volume of data and require connectivity and power for long periods.
    Besides, there are other limitations in memory, computer capacity, networks and
    limited power supply. In order to alleviate above issues, one important future
    research direction is to decide where the interactions will take place when combining
    blockchain technology with IoT, for example, inside the IoT, or blockchain, or
    a hybrid approach involving blockahin and IoT. It will need to discuss the advantages
    and disadvantages of these blockchain-IoT based applications through comparative
    analysis. This area is open for future researchers to investigate the impact and
    relative importance, and identify which one is the optimal choice to enhance agri-food
    information security. Table 6. Blockchain technology used for agri-food value
    chain information security. Authors Involved technologies Architecture Advantages
    Disadvantages Leng et al. [1] Blockchain Double chain architecture based on public

    and data would be increased Hybrid approach (1) Part of the data are stored in

    because involved more devices • Another finding of this study is a new trend of
    focusing on blockchain technology to achieve a higher level of sharing knowledge
    and services among agri-food manufacturers. Current agri-food manufacturing ecosystem
    is changing from integrated and centralized systems to shared and distributed
    systems. Most of the proposed framework for achieving higher performance were
    based on the blockchain technology and cloud computing, which aimed to provide
    a secure, low energy consumption and high efficiency systems to agri-food manufacturers.
    However, it still has some drawbacks. For example, unstable data transmission,
    lack of uniformed technology standard and low internet speed, etc. Blockchain
    technology integrated with edge computing provide a new way to achieve a higher
    level knowledge sharing performance through developing a distributed, sharing,
    standardized, and secured framework. Key technological components such as communication
    protocol, decentralized storage, smart contracts, edge cloud are all needed to
    build this system. However, there are questions remaining about the combination
    of blockchain and edge computing in enhancing overall efficiency and effectiveness
    of agri-food manufacturers. Thus, future studies should apply the blokchain technology
    and edge computing in different agri-food manufacturers using empirical and analytical
    tools to assess its effect on agri-food manufacturing. • A new trend emerging
    in the literature is the application of blockchain technology in sustainable water
    management. A few studies discussed how to apply blockchain technology to enhance
    water sustainability. However, these studies just considered how to enhance water
    sustainability from irrigator’s perspective and water company’s perspective, rather
    than taking the whole agri-food value chain stakeholders into consideration. Therefore,
    future work should holistically consider how to use blockchain technology to enhance
    water sustainability from the whole agri-food value chain perspective. 6.2. Future
    research directions for addressing the challenges of applying blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management From our systematic literature review, six
    key challenges emerged for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    management, they are storage capacity and scalability, privacy leakage, high cost
    problem, regulation problem, throughput and latency issue, and lack of skills.
    Although a growing body of literature is available on discussing these challenges,
    a number of challenges still exist. The purpose of this section is to highlight
    the main challenges identified in the literature and propose future research directions
    for unsolved problems. The identified solutions for the challenges of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management are summarized in Table 7. • One
    of key challenges for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    is the storage capacity. Although some researchers broadly investigated several
    methods that could enhance the storage capacity, for example, store part of the
    data on-chain and part of the data off-chain [85], build a multi-layers blockchain
    architecture with different purposes [40], and develop a new algorithm involved
    deep learning concept [12] (see Table 7). It is easily to find that more computational
    power is required when implementing these solution methods. Therefore, future
    work should investigate how to appropriate solve the data storage problem without
    increasing the computational power. Specifically, integrating the deep learning
    concept or artificially intelligence concept with current algorithms such as ant
    colony algorithm to achieve computational power efficiency and systematically
    eliminate the irrelevance data of blockchain provide a new route for solving the
    storage problem. Furthermore, comparative analysis of implementing these possible
    solutions in the context of agri-food value chain should be conducted empirically
    and analytically. • Most of the researchers investigated how to solve privacy
    leakage issues from single blockchain architecture perspective, and have applied
    different schemes such as Stealth Addresses, Pedersen Commitments, Ring signature,
    Homomorphic encryption, Zero-Knowledge-Proof to protect privacy of users. Few
    researchers investigated how to protect privacy from a double blockchain architecture
    perspective, that is, one for public, one for agri-food value chain participants.
    Therefore, future work should investigate how to design and evaluate double chain
    structures for blockchain. Further, conduct experiments to check how to combine
    the above-listed data privacy schemes to maximum the performance of data privacy
    mechanisms. • As for the high cost problem, different consensus algorithms have
    been proposed by various authors such as Proof-of-Stake and delegated Proof-of-Stake
    algorithm. Though these two algorithms have various advantages such as reducing
    the computing time, less nodes will be involved in the block validation, etc.
    However, no one have conducted comparative analysis using these two algorithms
    in empirical study in the context of agri-food value chain. This area is open
    for future researchers to systematically investigate the impact and relative importance
    of different mechanisms using empirical and analytical tools. • As discussed earlier,
    blockchain is a new technology which neither has any legislations or regulations
    to follow, nor has a defined way of how to insert the implications arising from
    blockchain technology into a norm setting. Although the application of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain is currently still in its infancy, it can
    be expected that more initiatives will be taken by various agri-food organizations
    [10]. Therefore, more work should be taken from theory and empirical perspectives
    to check the effects of blockchain technology on the agri-food value chain, especially
    to check its effect in the international agri-food trade, and then formulate corresponding
    standards based on the research results. • As for the throughput and latency issue,
    some researchers proposed different methods to solve this problem such as implementing
    Bitcoin-NG algorithm and increase the size of each block [17,89]. However, both
    of methods are not perfect enough which will have side effects such as larger
    blocks make full nodes more expensive to operate, and the latency is limited by
    the propagation time of the network, etc. Therefore, how to choose appropriate
    algorithm and block size without side effects become very important in solving
    the throughput and latency issue of blockchain. It is necessary to holistically
    consider this problem with continually experiments and get an optimal solution.
    • Finally, concerned with the lack of skills, we did not find many publications
    that gave us clear answers on this challenge. Only Ge et al. [10] proposed two
    learning objectives for solving the challenge of lacking skills: (1) learn general
    knowledge of blockchain technology; (2) identify how to benefit from blockchain
    technology. Table 7. The identified solutions for the challenges of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management. Main challenges Possible solutions

    7. Conclusions In this study, we conducted an SLNA to review existing work on
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. Through question formulation,
    locating studies, study selection and evaluation, we identified 71 publications,
    including journal papers, conference proceedings and book chapters. Then, we used
    software Gephi to build a citation network based on the citation data collected
    from Web of Science, which helped us to identify current trends and future research
    directions of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. The target
    publications of this study covered a broad spectrum of themes such as blockchain-based
    information security and traceability system, and blockchain-based water sustainability
    and food manufacturing. By synthesising the literature of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management within a 10-year timeframe (2008–2018), this
    paper makes contributions to existing knowledge in three aspects: (1) The paper
    provides an overall picture of the evolution of blockchain technology and its
    application in agri-food value chains. (2) The paper elicited key challenges and
    proposed initial solutions for applying blockchain technology to agri-food value
    chain. (3) Research gaps have been identified and future research directions were
    suggested for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management.
    The findings of this study provide a solid foundation for future studies in the
    area of blockchain technology and agri-food value chain management. Acknowledgment

    Get rights and content Highlights • Antibiotics and prevalence of antibiotic resistance
    genes in reservoirs • No clear associations between antibiotic occurrence and
    resistance genes • Composition of microbial communities explained by the presence
    of resistance genes • Actinobacteria and Firmicutes associated to the presence
    of resistance genes Abstract Antibiotic resistance represents a growing global
    health concern due to the overuse and misuse of antibiotics. There is, however,
    little information about how the selective pressure of clinical antibiotic usage
    can affect environmental communities in aquatic ecosystems and which bacterial
    groups might be responsible for dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs)
    into the environment. In this study, chemical and biological characterization
    of water and sediments from three water supply reservoirs subjected to a wide
    pollution gradient allowed to draw an accurate picture of the concentration of
    antibiotics and prevalence of ARGs, in order to evaluate the potential role of
    ARGs in shaping bacterial communities, and to identify the bacterial groups most
    probably carrying and disseminating ARGs. Results showed significant correlation
    between the presence of ARG conferring resistance to macrolides and the composition
    of bacterial communities, suggesting that antibiotic pollution and the spreading
    of ARG might play a role in the conformation of bacterial communities in reservoirs.
    Results also pointed out the bacterial groups Actinobacteria and Firmicutes as
    the ones probably carrying and disseminating ARGs. The potential effect of antibiotic
    pollution and the presence of ARGs on the composition of bacterial communities
    in lacustrine ecosystems prompt the fundamental question about potential effects
    on bacterial-related ecosystem services supplied by lakes and reservoirs. Previous

    1. Introduction One of the most significant groups of pollutants within the category
    of emerging contaminants is antibiotics (Schriks et al., 2010). Antibiotic compounds
    may be found in different environmental compartments due to their extensive use
    in human and veterinary medicine and the continuous drainage of surface runoff
    and release from wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). The presence of these compounds
    in freshwater systems has attracted increasing attention because of their potential
    threat to the environment (Gros et al., 2009, Kim and Carlson, 2007). Antibiotics
    may pose a risk to the ecosystems even at very low concentrations and persistence
    rates, as they are designed to have a biochemical effect in the microorganisms,
    and thus have a significant impact in the processes controlled by native biological
    communities (Maul et al., 2006, Muñoz et al., 2009). To date most research on
    the impact of antibiotic discharges into the environment are based on the effects
    on benthic invertebrates and algae (Cleuvers, 2003, Fent et al., 2006). However,
    little is known about the potential effects on the diversity and functioning of
    bacterial communities in lacustrine ecosystems, despite its fundamental role as
    regulators of the processes that define the majority of ecosystem services provided
    by these freshwater bodies, such as the capacity for self-purification (Bell et
    al., 2005). One of the greatest concerns about the presence of antibiotics in
    the environment is the emergence and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes
    (ARGs) due to continuous exposure of bacteria, even at very low antibiotic concentrations
    (Baquero et al., 2008, Kümmerer, 2009a, Kümmerer, 2009b, Martinez, 2009, Zuccato
    et al., 2010). Many of these genes are found on transposons, integrons or plasmids,
    which can be mobilized and transferred to other bacteria, belonging to the same
    or different species (Allen et al., 2010). Although, antibiotic resistance development
    has been extensively investigated in cultivable bacteria, especially those of
    clinical importance (D''Costa et al., 2007), the vast majority of environmental
    bacteria cannot be cultured using standard laboratory methods (Amann et al., 1995,
    Kirk et al., 2004, Oliver, 2010). As a result, there is little information about
    how the selective pressure of clinical antibiotic usage can affect environmental
    communities (D''Costa et al., 2011, Martinez, 2009) and which bacterial groups
    might be responsible for dissemination of ARGs in the environment (Allen et al.,
    2010, Li et al., 2011, Zhang et al., 2009). This is particularly relevant in the
    case of reservoirs used for abstraction of drinking water and recreational activities,
    two principal routes for resistant environmental bacteria and ARGs to reach human
    populations (Taylor et al., 2011). Water supply in Mediterranean countries is
    frequently based on resources stored in reservoirs located downstream from populated
    areas, defining these systems as ideal study sites to investigate the effect of
    antibiotic pollution on natural microbial communities. The objective of this study
    was to assess whether the occurrence of antibiotic compounds and ARGs can have
    a role in the composition of microbial communities from the water column and sediments
    of three water supply reservoirs (La Llosa del Cavall, Sau, and Foix) located
    near Barcelona, Spain. Concentrations of nine antibiotic families in water and
    sediment samples were measured by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography
    coupled to mass spectrometry. Real-time PCR was applied for the quantification
    of four selected ARGs, whereas pyrosequencing was used to analyze the bacterial
    community composition. This combined approach allowed to draw an accurate picture
    of the concentration of antibiotics and prevalence of ARGs in the studied reservoirs,
    to evaluate the associations between ARGs and bacterial communities, and to identify
    the bacterial groups most probably carrying and disseminating ARGs. 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Sampling and in situ measurements Three man-made reservoirs located
    in Catalonia (Spain) were chosen considering their role in water supply, irrigation,
    and recreational uses, as well as the intensity of human activity in the upstream
    watershed. La Llosa Reservoir is located in the headwaters of the Cardener River,
    and stores 79 hm3 of water (maximum depth 72 m, mean water residence time (WRT)
    333 days) devoted mainly to water supply and irrigation. Sau Reservoir (volume
    164 hm3, maximum depth 50 m, WRT 113 days) is located in a middle stretch of the
    Ter River, and is a fundamental player in the water supply scheme of the Barcelona
    Metropolitan Area. Finally, Foix Reservoir is a small reservoir (volume 3.7 hm3,
    maximum depth 11 m, WRT 106 days) located in the Foix River devoted to irrigation
    of local fields and hosts a number of recreational activities. These artificial
    reservoirs present an increasing pollution gradient from La Llosa Reservoir, which
    is near pristine conditions, to Foix Reservoir, which is a highly polluted water
    body, while Sau Reservoir is in an intermediate situation. The main stressor defining
    the pollution gradient observed in the reservoirs is the impact of effluents from
    upstream WWTP: in Foix Reservoir the mean percent of water entering the reservoir
    that comes from upstream WWTP effluents was 60% for the last decade, in Sau Reservoir
    was 10%, and in La Llosa Reservoir was 0.3%. Sampling campaigns were performed
    in May 2010 and May 2011. Samples were taken at three different points in each
    reservoir: near the main inflow (tail), in middle reach (mid), and near the dam.
    The rationale behind sampling in these three different points along the reservoirs
    is that the input of materials from the river promotes the establishment of heterogeneous
    bacterial communities along the reservoir (Šimek et al., 2011). During the sampling
    campaigns, reservoirs were stratified, with surface water temperature around 15
    °C and the bottom water around 8 °C. In the three sampling points visited in each
    reservoir a surface water sample (i.e. 0.5 m depth) was collected with a 5 L hydrographic
    bottle (except for LC–MS/MS analysis, where an amber glass bottle was used), and
    a sample from the top 4 cm of the sediments by means of a Ekman–Birge bottom sampler
    (Hydro-Bios). In the sampling point near the dam an additional water sample one
    meter above the sediments was collected (i.e., four water samples and three sediment
    samples for each reservoir in total). ARGs analyses and bacterial community characterization
    were performed only for samples collected in 2011. At every sampling station profiles
    of water temperature, conductivity, pH, and dissolved oxygen were measured with
    a SeaBird 19plus SEACAT CTD Profiler. The amount of light down the profiles was
    assessed by means of a Li-COR spherical Quantum Sensor (LI-193SA), and the light
    extinction coefficient calculated assuming the Beer–Lambert law. Hydrological
    data for the reservoirs were supplied by the Catalan Water Agency (ACA). 2.2.
    General parameters Water samples were filtered through GF/F filters and analyzed
    for nitrate and chloride by liquid chromatography in a Konik KNK 500-A, and for
    soluble phosphate (Murphy and Riley, 1962) and ammonia (Solórzano, 1969) by a
    colorimetric method. Dissolved organic carbon concentration was quantified by
    combustion in a Shimadzu TOC-5000 Analyzer after filtration through a GF/F filter
    and acidification to remove inorganic carbon. Suspended solids were calculated
    by gravimetry. Total dissolved iron and manganese were measured through the phenantroline
    method and the persulfate method, respectively (APHA, 1992). Density of live bacteria
    was assessed after staining water samples with Live/Dead(R) BacLight™ bacterial
    viability kit. For the top 4 cm of the sediment samples, concentrations of As,
    Ba, Cd, Ce, Co, Cr, Cu, Ga, Mn, Mo, Nb, Ni, Pb, Rb, Sn, Sr, Th, Ti, V, W, Y, Zn,
    Zr, and Fe were determined through X-ray fluorescence (model: Axios advanced PANalytical)
    after adhesion using Elvactite 2044 and posterior pressing. 2.3. Antibiotic analysis
    A Baker vacuum system (J.T. Baker, The Netherlands) was used to pre-concentrate
    the water samples using an adapted method (Gros et al., 2012). Briefly, water
    sample was pH-adjusted to 3 with 1.0 M HCl and 10 ml of 1 M EDTA (4%, v/v) was
    added. Oasis HLB cartridges (60 mg, 3 ml) cartridges (Waters, Massachusetts, USA)
    were loaded with 250 mL of water samples. Cartridges were eluted with 10 ml of
    methanol. The extracts were evaporated under a gentle nitrogen stream and reconstituted
    with 1 mL of methanol–water mixture (50:50, v/v). A detailed description of the
    sediment extraction method can be found elsewhere (Yang et al., 2010). Briefly,
    1 g of freeze-dried sediment was sonicated for 15 minutes in 10 mL of 0.2 M citric
    buffer (pH 4.0) and acetonitrile solution (50:50, v/v). Each extract was centrifuged
    and the supernatant diluted to 500 mL and purified with SPE following the same
    procedure as water samples. Extracts were analyzed using the method developed
    by Gros et al. (Gros et al., 2013) using a UPLC Waters chromatographic system
    (Milford, MA, USA) coupled to a Qtrap 5500 (Applied Biosystems) mass spectrometer.
    Chromatographic separation was achieved with an ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 column (2.1
    × 50 mm, particle size 1.8 μm) at 30 °C, supplied by Waters (Milford, MA, USA).
    Recoveries for the analyzed antibiotic compounds were 50–133% for water samples,
    and 33–101% for sediment samples. 2.4. Quantification of ARGs by real-time PCR
    Water samples were filtered through 0.22 μm nylon filters (Millipore) in order
    to concentrate bacterial cells. The membranes were then resuspended in lysis buffer
    (1.2% Triton X-100, 20 mM Tris–Cl, 2 mM sodium EDTA, and 20 mg/ml), and DNA was
    extracted using a standard phenol-chloroform method. Sediment samples were also
    collected, weighed, and homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 10 mM sodium
    phosphate, 150 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.2). The homogenates were then resuspended
    in lysis buffer and DNA was extracted as mentioned above. All samples were collected
    and analyzed in duplicate. The ARGs considered in this study were blaTEM, ermB,
    qnrS, and sulI, which confer resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, macrolides, quinolones
    (including fluoroquinolones) and sulfonamides, respectively. ARGs were quantified
    in all DNA extracted samples using real-time PCR. Copy number of the 16S rRNA
    gene was also quantified for normalization of the data. All real-time PCR assays
    were amplified in duplicate using the Brilliant III Ultra-Fast SYBR® Green QPCR
    Master Mix (Agilent Technologies) on a MX3005P system (Agilent Technologies),
    with the exception for the blaTEM gene, which was amplified using the SYBR® Green
    Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The primers sets and the thermal cycling parameters
    were specific for each gene (Table A.1). After the PCR, a dissociation curve (melting
    curve) was constructed in the range of 60 °C to 95 °C. Escherichia coli strain
    488 (blaTEM), Enterococcus sp. strain CO4097 (ermB), E. coli strain J53 pMG306
    (qnrS) and Aeromonas sp. strain P2G1 (sulI) were used as positive controls to
    make the standards by transforming gene-bearing plasmids into E. coli using the
    TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen). Plasmids were then extracted using the PureLink
    plasmid kit (Invitrogen), and the concentration was determined using a NanoDrop
    spectrophotometer (NanoDrop). Ten-fold serial dilutions of purified plasmid DNA
    were used for the generation of standard curves for each ARG. Gene copies were
    calculated as described previously (Marti and Balcazar, 2012). Data (copy number
    of each ARG) were compared using the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Kruskal-Wallis
    test as appropriate, because most data were not normally distributed. Data were
    analyzed using SPSS for Windows version 17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). 2.5. Analysis
    of bacterial community composition by pyrosequencing Purified DNA samples from
    each sampling point were amplified separately with primers 27F (3′-GAG TTT GAT
    CNT GGC TCAG-5′) and 519R (3′-GTN TTA CNG CGG CKG CTG-5′), and the amplicons were
    sequenced using Roche 454 GS FLX Titanium chemistry. Raw sequencing reads were
    quality trimmed using the MOTHUR software package (Schloss et al., 2009). Sequences
    were restricted to the first 250 bp and aligned using the SILVA reference database
    (Pruesse et al., 2007). Sequences were then randomly removed from each library
    to retain a total of 10855 (water samples) and 6058 (sediment samples) sequences
    for each treatment in order to minimize any bias due to the difference in the
    total number of sequences. The Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) pipeline and Classifier
    function (Wang et al., 2007) were used to align and assign identities at a confidence
    threshold of 80%. MOTHUR was used to assign sequences to operational taxonomic
    units (OTUs, 97% similarity) and calculate both Shannon''s diversity index values
    (H′) and Chao1 richness estimates. The parsimony test, as implemented by MOTHUR,
    was used to assess whether two or more communities have the same structure. A
    Bonferroni correction was applied to adjust the significance level for multiple
    pairwise comparisons. The sequence data from this study have been deposited in
    the NCBI Short Read Archive under accession number SRA049379. 2.6. Data analyses
    To investigate the generality of longitudinal patterns in reservoirs, mean normalized
    concentrations of antibiotics were calculated to be able to combine data from
    the different reservoirs in common analyses and figures. Antibiotic concentrations
    along a given reservoir were normalized by the corresponding average of the whole
    system, and then data from all reservoirs were used to calculate cross-system
    means and standard deviations for the tail, mid, and dam regions (water and sediments
    treated separately). The same procedure was used to calculate mean normalized
    ARG abundances. To search for potential links between antibiotic pollution, ARGs,
    and bacterial communities, a series of Redundancy Analysis (RDA)-based analyses
    was performed. First, the relative importance of environmental variables (including
    antibiotic concentrations), space (geographic coordinates) (Van der Gucht et al.,
    2007), and the presence of ARGs in explaining the bacterial communities in the
    water column and sediments, separately, was determined. The total variation of
    the bacterial community matrix was decomposed into unique environmental, spatial,
    and ARG components with corresponding p values using RDA and partial RDA (Borcard
    et al., 1992, Cottenie et al., 2003, Legendre and Legendre, 1998). This analysis
    measures the amount of variation that can be attributed exclusively to one set
    of explanatory (environment, space, or ARGs) variables and the variation explained
    by correlations between the different sets (shared or common term). The significance
    of these components was evaluated with a Monte Carlo permutation test (Legendre
    and Legendre, 1998), and the variation components were bias-corrected (Peres-Neto
    et al., 2006). Although the set of samples for the analyses was limited (n = 12
    for water samples, n = 9 for sediments), RDA and partial RDA included in the variation
    analyses never used a number of explanatory variables in excess of n/2 (Borcard
    et al., 2011) in the case of water samples, and only one RDA failed to fulfill
    this condition for the sediment set. This was accomplished reducing the number
    of explanatory variables in each set to the most parsimonious subset of significant
    variables with a forward selection procedure. This procedure also prevented over-fitting
    and co-linearity. The bacterial community data consisted in percentages to avoid
    the deleterious effect of the different density of bacteria on the analyses, while
    all explanatory variables were log transformed and standardized. No significant
    eigenvector or polynomial spatial variable was found, hence only the geographic
    coordinates were considered in the analyses. The association between antibiotics
    and ARGs in the water column and sediments was assessed performing two separate
    RDA using as explanatory variables the corresponding set of environmental variables
    measured in this study. Due to the large number of potential explanatory variables,
    the most parsimonious subsets of significant variables were selected with a forward
    selection procedure. The association between ARGs and bacterial groups in water
    and sediments was also tested through RDA, using the ARGs data as the explanatory
    matrix. Forward selection was used as above to avoid over-fitting and co-linearity.
    All RDA and partial RDA included in this study were performed with R (R Development
    Core Team, 2007) and the Vegan library (Oksanen et al., 2007). 3. Results 3.1.
    Pollution gradient The general physico-chemical characterization (Table A.2) allowed
    us to confirm a clear eutrophication and pollution gradient from La Llosa to Foix.
    Water samples for Foix Reservoir showed extremely high values for ammonia, phosphate,
    and metals. Nonetheless, maximum values for the light extinction coefficient were
    very high at Foix Reservoir, according to the largest levels of suspended solids.
    Chloride concentration, a variable closely related to pollution in reservoirs
    (Marcé et al., 2008), was also largest in Foix Reservoir. On the contrary, in
    the case of sediment samples, results did not support the existence of an obvious
    pollution gradient in this compartment (Table A.2). Among elements that can be
    potentially attributed to human pollution, only Cu, Pb, and Zn showed mild gradients
    with largest values at Foix Reservoir. 3.2. Antibiotic occurrence Antibiotic levels
    at the water column reached their maximum in Foix Reservoir, where the most abundant
    antibiotic families found were macrolides and sulfonamides, with erythromycin
    and sulfamethoxazole as the main family representatives, respectively (Fig. 1A–F,
    Table A.3). In contrast, very low concentrations were found in water from Sau
    and La Llosa Reservoirs, where maximum concentrations were in the low ng L− 1
    range. The most prevalent antibiotic compound in these two reservoirs was sulfamethozaxole,
    present in all the water samples from Sau Reservoir and four samples out of twelve
    from La Llosa. Antibiotic concentrations in sediment samples were slightly higher
    in Foix Reservoir (Fig. 1G–L, Table A.4), but this tendency was less evident than
    in water samples. Whereas macrolides followed the same occurrence pattern found
    in water, sulfonamides and tetracyclines showed a different behavior, with relatively
    constant concentrations across reservoirs. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 1. Average antibiotic concentration and ARG abundance at the water column
    and sediments found in three water supply reservoirs. For each antibiotic family
    and reservoir, calculations include all concentrations measured above the limit
    of quantification from all sampling points. For each ARG and reservoir, calculations
    included all sampling points. Missing points indicate that the antibiotic family
    or ARG was not detected. Bars denote standard deviations, and some were not plotted
    because they extended beyond zero in the logarithmic axis. Antibiotic concentration
    along the water body of all reservoirs sampled in this study (Fig. 2A–F) presented
    two distinct situations: a) the compounds tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole, and
    erythromycin showed stable concentrations along the water body, a similar result
    to that found for chloride, a conservative ion often used as a tracer, indicating
    that these substances did not experienced major transformations during transport
    along reservoirs; whereas b) ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin seemed to be influenced
    by attenuation processes, as their concentrations decreased significantly from
    the tail to the dam. Considering the dynamics of chloride, this reduction in the
    concentrations cannot be attributed to dilution inside the reservoir but to other
    biotic or abiotic processes such as sorption in particulate matter and photo and
    biodegradation. Greater variability within each reservoir was present in sediment
    samples (Fig. 2G–K), where the fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin were
    absent. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Occurrence of chloride, selected
    antibiotics and ARGs in the water column and sediments along the longitudinal

    For reference, the normalized concentration that equals the mean (i.e., one) was
    indicated as a dashed horizontal line, and we included results of an exponential
    fit and corresponding curve for fluoroquinolones. Missing points indicate that
    the antibiotic or ARG was not detected. Bars denote standard deviations, and some
    were not plotted because they extended beyond zero in the logarithmic axis. 3.3.
    Prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) Quantitative analysis of ARGs
    in water samples showed that qnrS and ermB genes had a higher copy number in Foix
    Reservoir than in Sau and La Llosa del Cavall reservoirs (Fig. 1M–P). In addition,
    the abundance of the sulI gene was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in water samples
    from Foix and Sau reservoirs compared with the abundance in La Llosa del Cavall
    Reservoir. However, no significant differences (p > 0.05) in abundance of the
    blaTEM gene was found among reservoirs. For sediment samples, only the abundance
    of the sulI gene was significantly greater (p < 0.05) in Foix Reservoir compared
    to the other two reservoirs (Fig. 1Q-R). The qnrS gene was only detected in sediment
    samples collected from Foix and Sau reservoirs. However, there was no significant
    difference (p > 0.05) in copy number between the two reservoirs. The blaTEM and
    ermB genes showed similar copy number in sediment samples from the three reservoirs.
    Although the normalized concentration of ARGs in water samples collected at the
    tail of the reservoirs tended to be larger than in mid and dam regions (Fig. 2L–S),
    the differences did not reach the level of statistical significance, with the
    exception of the qnrS gene whose concentration was significantly higher (p < 0.05)
    at the tail. A higher concentration of ARGs was indeed observed in sediment samples
    collected at the tail stations, with the exception of the qnrS gene whose concentration
    did not show any significant difference among sampling points. 3.4. Bacterial
    community composition Phylum level affiliations of sequences encountered in each
    sampling point revealed a diverse bacterial community. The relative abundance
    of bacterial communities at the phylum level (classes for Proteobacteria) showed
    that the dominant bacterial groups in water samples were Actinobacteria, Betaproteobacteria,
    and Bacteroidetes (Fig. 3), except for the tail of Foix Reservoir where Actinobacteria
    and Gammaproteobacteria were dominant. The bacterial community composition in
    sediment samples was more variable among the different sampling points (Fig. 3),
    as measured by the Shannon diversity index and Chao1 richness estimator (Tables
    A.5-A.8). The dominant bacterial groups in sediment samples were Actinobacteria,
    Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria in La Llosa del Cavall Reservoir;
    Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, and Planctomycetes in Sau Reservoir; and Actinobacteria,
    Firmicutes, and Planctomycetes in Foix Reservoir. A high proportion of unclassified
    bacteria (mean value for all the sediment samples = 17.41 ± 6.63, n = 9) was also
    observed. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Bacterial community composition
    in A) water samples; B) sediment samples from the three reservoirs.##. Despite
    the high degree of similarity shared among the bacterial communities from each
    sampling point at the phylum level, differences with respect to community structure
    and composition became apparent at the genus level (97% similarity). Pairwise
    comparison of each bacterial community harbored a phylogenetic structure that
    was significantly different (p < 0.01) from each other, as determined by the phylogeny-based
    parsimony test (Tables A.5 and A.6). Only water samples collected at the tail,
    mid, and dam sites from La Llosa del Cavall Reservoir did not show any significant
    difference in the bacterial community structure. 3.5. Links between antibiotics,
    ARGs, and bacterial communities A variation partitioning analysis was performed
    to identify the environmental and spatial factors that best explain the disparity
    in bacterial communities found in water and sediment samples (see Section 2.6).
    The analysis included the geographic location of sampling points, the environmental
    variables measured in this study (including antibiotic concentration), and the
    ARG abundance data as a third additional descriptor group. As for water samples,
    the analysis explained the 80% of the variation in the bacterial community data,
    and yielded 19% of total variance explained by ARG alone, 17% by environmental
    variables alone, 11% by geographical location alone, and 33% by a common effect
    (Fig. 4A and Table A.9). In particular, the variables that significantly contributed
    to explain the overall bacterial community patterns where: geographic location
    (x coordinate), water temperature, pH, light extinction coefficient, and normalized
    emrB and blaTEM copy numbers. In the case of sediment samples, the analysis explained
    the 74% of the variation of the bacterial communities, but we could not identify
    any significant isolated component (Fig. 4B and Table A.9). This was most probably
    because the explanatory matrices were highly correlated, as showed by the large
    shared component (69%). Geographical location was not significant in this case,
    being the variables that significantly contributed to explain the overall bacterial
    community patterns: W, Rb, and Mn concentration, and normalized emrB and sulI
    copy numbers. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Analysis of the relationships

    Potential links between the environmental conditions and the abundance of ARGs
    in water and sediment samples were explored performing a RDA, using the environmental
    variables (including antibiotic concentration) as an explanatory matrix. In the
    case of water samples, the analysis explained 85% of the variability of the ARGs
    data (Fig. 4C, p < 0.0001), with a disproportional large effect of macrolides
    concentration (adjusted r2 = 0.64, p = 0.001) and minor contributions of density
    of live bacteria (adjusted R2 = 0.15, p = 0.001) and the light extinction coefficient
    (adjusted r2 = 0.06, p = 0.001). It was noteworthy the association between macrolides
    concentration and normalized ermB copy numbers (Pearson''s r2 = 0.77, p = 0.0002,
    n = 12), and between the density of live bacteria and normalized sulI (Pearson''s
    r2 = 0.54, p = 0.0067, n = 12). For the sediments, the analysis explained 50%
    of the variability of the ARG data (Fig. 4D, p = 0.016), with a significant effect
    of macrolides concentration (adjusted r2 = 0.28, p = 0.036) and Cd concentration
    (adjusted r2 = 0.18, p = 0.044). Macrolides concentration correlated positively
    with sulI copy number (Pearson''s r2 = 0.52, p = 0.0293, n = 9), while Cd concentration
    was inversely related to qnrS (Pearson''s r2 = 0.51, p = 0.0308, n = 9). Finally,
    associations between ARGs and bacterial groups in water samples were assessed
    performing a RDA using the ARGs data as the explanatory matrix (Fig. 4E). The
    analysis explained 52% of the variability of the bacterial community data (p <
    0.0027), with the blaTEM (adjusted r2 = 0.40, p = 0.011) and ermB (adjusted r2
    = 0.12, p = 0.016) genes as significant explanatory variables. Although the RDA
    suggested a positive association between normalized ermB copy numbers and the
    percentage of Firmicutes, as well as between the blaTEM gene and the percentage
    of Actinobacteria, paired Pearson''s correlations did not show any significant
    result. Remarkably, in RDA analysis for the sediment samples, the bacterial groups
    related to ARGs in water samples were also involved in main associations found
    in the sediments (Fig. 4F). Explained variability was 69% (p < 0.0001), with the
    ermB (adjusted R2 = 0.57, p = 0.002) and sulI (adjusted r2 = 0.12, p = 0.019)
    genes as significant predictors. The ermB gene strongly and significantly correlated
    with the percentage of Actinobacteria (Pearson''s r2 = 0.88, p = 0.0002, n = 9),
    as well as the sulI gene with Firmicutes (Pearson''s r2 = 0.61, p = 0.0129, n
    = 9). 4. Discussion Significant associations between the ARGs and bacterial community
    composition in three water supply reservoirs were detected. Although a correlation
    exercise cannot confirm the hypothesis that antibiotic occurrence and ARGs is
    shaping the bacterial communities in the reservoirs sampled, results suggested
    that this is the most plausible explanation for the associations found. A potential
    alternative explanation is that correlations were spurious, that is, promoted
    by an unnoticed common cause. This common cause might be the effect of WWTP effluents
    containing resistant bacteria (Pruden et al., 2006), which means that all associations
    found between ARGs and bacterial communities were just promoted by the fact that
    both bacteria and ARGs are released from upstream WWTPs. Although this may be
    the main explanation for the presence of the detected ARGs in the resistome of
    the bacterial communities, this cannot explain associations between ARG and bacterial
    communities found in this study considering the WRT of the water bodies under
    investigation. Since WRT in the reservoirs is in the order of months, the bacterial
    communities are the result of the complex ecological interactions (e.g., competence,
    predation) among bacteria and the other components of the food web after presumably
    hundreds or thousands of bacterial live cycles. Although it is reasonable to think
    that the presence of ARGs in the resistome can be facilitated by direct pollution
    from WWTP effluents, the most plausible explanation for the associations found
    between ARGs and the bacterial communities is that ARGs and the resistant bacteria
    spread in the bacterial community facilitated by the presence of the selective
    agent (antibiotic). The association between ARGs and the bacterial communities
    was more evident in the water column, where ARGs was the unique variation component
    with the strongest explaining power (19%), despite the dominant role of the variation
    shared by the three explaining sets (33%). The variation shared by the different
    explaining sets precluded the detection of any significant unique component in
    the sediments, but considering the highly significant explanatory power of the
    ARGs data the effect of ARGs on the bacterial communities cannot be discarded
    (Table A.8). In any case, the pollution gradient in water samples was more evident
    than in the sediments, where differences in environmental variables and ARGs were
    less apparent. Normalized ARGs abundance in water and sediments from the same
    sampling site were closely related (Fig. A.1), suggesting a common process, with
    the only exception of qnrS (related to fluoroquinolones, the antibiotic family
    with the most variable concentration in water and absent in the sediment). Maximum
    antibiotic concentrations found in this study are frequently reported in systems
    affected by effluents of wastewater treatment plants (Zhou et al., 2011). In this
    case, the pollution gradient between reservoirs was mainly determined by the wastewater
    contribution to the total inflow to the reservoir, which peaked at Foix Reservoir
    (average annual contribution of 31%). Some studies have shown that exposure to
    highly antibiotic-contaminated effluent promotes resistance genes in environmental
    bacterial communities (Kristiansson et al., 2011), but other studies suggest that
    levels of antibiotics below the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) can also
    select resistant bacteria (Gullberg et al., 2011). Thus, even though the levels
    of antibiotics found in this study are, as expected, far below the MIC for bacteria,
    it cannot be excluded that they might exert a selection pressure enough to maintain
    the resistome in environmental communities. Highest concentrations of antibiotics
    corresponded to macrolides and sulfamides (water), and tetracyclines (sediment),
    in similar levels (ng/L to μg/L) to those found in some studies carried out in
    river water and sediments (Tong et al., 2009, Yang et al., 2010). Although RDA
    identified macrolides concentration as a principal variable for explaining the
    variability of ARG in both, water and sediment samples, antibiotic concentration
    was not a significant variable in variation analyses of the bacterial communities.
    However, this might be a consequence of the incapability of the analyses to assess
    the presence of all antibiotic compounds present in the samples, including metabolites
    and transformation products that can have similar or even higher biological activity
    (Boxall et al., 2004). Thus, the ARG data may be considered as an integrative
    proxy of the presence of a complex mixture of antibiotic pollutants, better reflecting
    the impacts of pollution on the bacterial communities. Metals can also be responsible
    for the presence of ARG due to co-resistance mechanisms (Baker-Austin et al.,
    2006, Knapp et al., 2011), although no positive association between ARG and concentration
    of metals was found in this study. However, the presence of metals could be a
    factor correlated with the transport and accumulation of antibiotics. For instance,
    fluoroquinolones are known to form complexes with some iron oxides, which suggest
    a tendency to adsorb onto clay minerals (Gu and Karthikeyan, 2005). Also, the
    adsorption of tetracyclines on sediments strongly depends on the pH and presence
    of metals (Zhang et al., 2011). Values of metals in the target reservoirs showed
    a maximum of fifty-fold higher concentration of Fe2+ in water from Foix than from
    La Llosa Reservoir, what could explain the higher concentration of antibiotics
    in the sediment of Foix Reservoir, as a result of not only the greater antibiotic
    concentration but also other pollutants that might increase antibiotic residence
    time in the system. One of the most relevant results from this study is that two
    bacterial groups associated to the presence of ARGs in both water and sediments
    were identified as Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. This is not unexpected, because
    some members of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes are producers of antibiotics (Allen
    et al., 2010, Kieser et al., 2000, Mannanov and Sattarova, 2001). Considering
    that analyses for the different compartments were independent, this suggests that
    these two groups may be related to the dissemination of ARGs in natural environments
    like reservoirs. This is in accordance with previous studies, showing that most
    resistant bacteria belong to Gram-positive group (Mindlin et al., 2008). These
    results are remarkable considering that Actinobacteria was the bacterial group
    contributing the most to the bacterial communities sampled in this study (mean
    abundance = 22 ± 13%), suggesting that indeed ARGs may be significantly linked
    to bacterial community composition in freshwaters affected by antibiotic pollution.
    The association between ARG and Firmicutes was less conclusive, because in some
    samples the relatively low number of Firmicutes may be explained as a residual
    population coming directly from the upstream WWTP effluents. If this were the
    case, the association would be entirely spurious, with no implications related
    to the dynamics of the natural community. Although the strong and highly significant
    relationship found in the sediment samples between Actinobacteria and the ermB
    gene as well as between Firmicutes and the sulI gene seems to support an association
    between particular taxa and particular ARG, this information should be interpreted
    with caution. Several of the ARGs abundances were significantly correlated both,
    in water and sediments, and other ARGs not measured in this study might be present
    in the samples. Thus, the possibility that significant ARGs detected by RDA simply
    reflect the effect of non-measured ARGs, or that the uncertainty of the measurements
    resulted in the observed associations, while masking the causal relationships
    that would include different measured ARG, cannot be discarded. The fact that
    Actinobacteria is related with the ermB gene in sediments but with the blaTEM
    gene in the water column seems to point in this direction (the same reasoning
    is valid for Firmicutes, sulI, and ermB). The association between Actinobacteria,
    Firmicutes and the presence of ARGs can be considered robust, but the bacterial
    group in charge of carrying each ARG cannot be appointed. It is also difficult
    to ascertain whether other significant environmental and spatial variables in
    the analyses have a real effect on the bacterial communities or they simply reflect
    other environmental conditions, which are either not measured or confounded in
    spatial differences. The presence of significant variables like metals W or Rb
    concentration seems to point to the latter. Although the correlations cannot confirm
    causal mechanisms, the significant role of macrolides, ermB, Actinobacteria and
    Firmicutes in independent analyses suggests that antibiotic pollution may play
    a role in the conformation of bacterial communities in reservoirs via the spreading
    of ARGs. Macrolides are the most prevalent antibiotic family measured in our samples,
    and the ermB gene is an ARG conferring resistance to, precisely, macrolides. Finally,
    the ermB gene had a significant role in explaining bacterial community variability
    in both water and sediment samples, and at least in sediments showed a clear relationship
    with abundance of Actinobacteria. In fact, a search using BLASTN (Altschul et
    al., 1990) for the matching sequences in the GenBank database including updates
    against the sequence for the ermB gene (GenBank accession no. AJ972606) as a query
    sequence revealed the presence of this gene in several bacterial species, including
    members of Actinobacteria, such as Eggerthella sp. (GenBank accession no. AP012211)
    and Trueperella pyogenes (GenBank accession no. AY334073). The spreading of the
    ermB gene may be facilitated due to the fact that it is associated with conjugative
    transposons located in chromosomes as well as on plasmids (Roberts, 2008). Again,
    although our results cannot prove the existence of such a causal chain, we can
    speculate about the existence of a selective pressure of macrolides on the bacterial
    communities, with spreading of ARGs (already present in the community or coming
    from ARGs pollution from WWTPs) as a convenient mechanism used by particular bacterial
    groups to out-compete others. But more research in needed to confirm this mechanism.
    Although some studies already described impacts of antibiotics on the functionality
    of bacterial communities in aquatic environments (Bundschuh et al., 2009, Maul
    et al., 2006), this is one of the few studies to describe significant associations
    between antibiotic pollution, the presence of ARGs, and the composition of bacterial
    communities in lacustrine ecosystems. Moreover, the fact that the bacterial communities
    were analyzed by pyrosequencing avoided the bias obtained when evaluating antibiotic
    resistance in environmental microbial communities based only on cultivable bacteria.
    However, we can only speculate about the effects of the shifts of the bacterial
    communities promoted by antibiotic pollution and ARGs on the functionality of
    the ecosystem. While it is well known the principal role of bacteria in the ecosystem
    processes that define most of the ecosystem services provided by lacustrine ecosystems
    (e.g., organic matter degradation, denitrification), information to anticipate
    the impact of the combination of antibiotic pollution and the presence of ARGs
    on the bacterial communities is lacking. Are ARGs conferring resilience against
    the impacts of antibiotic pollution thus maintaining the community physiological
    profiles (i.e. the capacity to degrade a number of carbon sources) and growth
    indices, or some biogeochemical processes will be severely impacted by the community
    shift? In the light of these results, these kinds of questions deserve much more
    attention in the future. Acknowledgments We thank Carles Borrego, Enrique Navarro,

    for the future of agriculture. Therefore, agricultural systems must be sustainable
    not only under average conditions, but also under extreme changes of productivity,
    economy, environment and social context. Here, we review four concepts: stability,
    robustness, vulnerability and resilience. Those concepts are commonly used but
    are sometimes difficult to distinguish due to the lack of clear boundaries. Here,
    we clarify the role of these concepts in addressing agronomic issues. Our main
    findings are as follows: (1) agricultural systems face different types of perturbations,
    from small and usual perturbations to extreme and unpredictable changes; (2) stability,
    robustness, vulnerability and resilience have been increasingly applied to analyze
    the agricultural context in order to predict the system response under changing
    conditions; (3) the four concepts are distinguished by the nature of the system
    components and by the type of perturbation studied; (4) assessment methods must
    be tested under contrasted situations; and (5) the major options allowing system
    adaptation under extreme and unpredictable changes are the increase of diversity
    and the increase of the adaptive capacity. Similar content being viewed by others

    Conclusion 7. References 1 Introduction Farming activities are regularly exposed
    to unpredictable perturbations, i.e. changes in environmental or socio-economic
    constraints which cannot be anticipated. Facing uncertainties, farmers have to
    deal not only with urgent and short-term tactical issues (e.g. protecting a crop
    from pests or taking advantage of sowing opportunities) but also with more strategic
    decisions driven by their medium- to long-term objectives (Rodriguez et al. 2011).
    In general, the predominant approach to mitigate the impacts of exogenous changes
    on cropping and livestock systems is based on controlling environmental conditions
    (ten Napel et al. 2006). Modern intensive farming, which relies heavily on pesticides,
    antibiotics, mineral fertilizers and irrigation in order to control system conditions,
    has proven to be a successful approach to maximize productivity per production
    unit and increase agricultural production in the world. The most illustrative
    example of this approach is greenhouse production where fruits and vegetables
    are grown in a highly standardized and controlled environment. Nevertheless, evidence
    of drawbacks of this approach is accumulating: despite a strong artificialization
    of agricultural landscapes and intensive use of chemical inputs, crops and livestock
    around the world are still exposed to various types of exogenous perturbations,
    such as outbreaks of infectious diseases in animal production and development
    of pest and pathogen resistances to pesticides in crop production. Moreover, negative
    environmental impacts of intensive farming systems are evident, such as air and
    water pollution and loss of biodiversity (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005).
    In recent years, social and political pressure for more sustainable agricultural
    systems showed up the need for implementing more sustainable production systems
    and led to the emergence of various methods and indicators to quantify the sustainability
    of farming activities. These methods generally include economic, environmental
    and societal pillars and are usually based on multicriteria approaches addressing
    these different issues (Bockstaller et al. 2009). However, these methods are generally
    focused on the assessment of average agricultural outputs (i.e. under conditions
    that are considered as “normal”) and do not consider performance changes in time
    and space, particularly when exogenous perturbations occur. Thus, scientists and
    stakeholders are currently reconsidering agricultural system design in order to
    better take into account the variability of environmental conditions (Naylor 2008).
    As part of this new vision, changes and adaptations are recognized as essential
    elements: the ability to continue to achieve goals despite the occurrence of perturbations
    is becoming a central issue in the assessment of agricultural sustainability (Tendall
    et al. 2015). This concern is generally expressed through a paradigm shift, from
    maximizing average productivity in a stable environment towards reducing performance
    changes in an environment subject to greater variation (Milestad et al. 2012).
    However, this transition requires new knowledge and expertise to characterize
    and assess the ability of agricultural systems to maintain high levels of agricultural
    outputs in a non-stable environment (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Agricultural systems are
    facing multiple and unpredictable perturbations. The impact on a sunflower field
    of salted sea water flooding induced by Xynthia storm in 2010, in Rochefort area
    (France). Photo credit: INRA Full size image In the face of this challenge, different
    concepts such as stability, robustness, vulnerability and resilience have been
    developed in recent decades. Despite conceptualization from different discipline
    backgrounds, these four concepts all focus on the ability of diverse systems to
    maintain or recover their functionalities in a challenging environment. An increasing
    number of review articles illustrate the growing interest of scientists from different
    disciplines in these concepts (see, for example, Mumby et al. (2014) for a review
    of resilience, robustness and vulnerability applied to marine ecosystems; Gallopín
    (2006) for a review of vulnerability and resilience applied to socio-ecological
    systems; and Mens et al. (2011) for a review of robustness, resilience and vulnerability
    applied to flood risk management). These concepts have also been used in agricultural
    sciences, either as equivalent terms (National Research Council 2010) or as concepts
    to be combined for a more comprehensive and integrative approach (Callo-Concha
    and Ewert 2014). Due to fuzzy boundaries between these four concepts, we have
    noticed the difficulty for some scientists in agricultural sciences in defining
    them correctly and understanding their differences and potential uses. Furthermore,
    a clear analytical framework associated with each concept is still lacking and
    hence limits their usefulness to assess the ability of agricultural systems to
    cope with perturbations. In the present paper, we aim to clarify the potential
    of stability, robustness, vulnerability and resilience as operational concepts
    to assess the ability of agricultural systems to deal with a context of increasing
    uncertainty. In the following sections, the paper will first introduce agricultural
    systems and their exposure to exogenous changes (Sect. 2). Then, we will review
    different strands of literature to define more clearly each concept and assess
    their differences and respective uses in agricultural sciences (Sect. 3). Based
    on recent papers, we will discuss operational methods available to characterize
    and quantify the ability of agricultural systems to cope with various types of
    perturbation (Sect. 4). Finally, the paper will outline some key levers to improve
    the ability of agricultural systems to deal with a more changeable environment
    (Sect. 5). 2 Agricultural systems facing a more changeable environment In order
    to explore the position of each concept regarding the assessment of agricultural
    performance in a variable environment, we start by clarifying what agricultural
    systems are and what are their interactions with external drivers. 2.1 Agricultural
    systems Agricultural systems are socio-ecological systems, comprising biotechnical
    and social factors, and dedicated to the production of productive, economic, environmental
    and social outputs (Renting et al. 2009). On the one hand, biotechnical factors
    consist of biological and technical components linked through feedback mechanisms
    (ten Napel et al. 2011). Biological components comprise not only domesticated
    plant and animal species but also non-domesticated species like pests and pollinators
    of crops. Technical components consist of engineering elements designed to optimize
    agricultural outputs (e.g. irrigation system and decision support tools). On the
    other hand, social factors refer to farmers’ actions and attitudes and in which
    may be considered separately the psychological make-up of the farmer and the characteristics
    of the farm household (Edwards-Jones 2006). According to this basic conceptual
    scheme, the agricultural outputs of a farm are highly influenced by the interaction
    between the different components that constitute biotechnical and social factors.
    However, agricultural systems are also embedded in larger systems such as food,
    institutional or social systems. Hence, they are also influenced by external drivers
    which can be a source of unpredictable changes for farmers. 2.2 A more changeable
    environment External drivers of agricultural systems encompass bio-geophysical,
    social, economic and political environments that determine how agricultural activities
    are performed. These drivers can vary significantly in time and space and therefore
    can affect agricultural systems positively or negatively. Depending on the frequency,
    duration and predictability of these changes, Maxwell (1986) distinguished four
    different types of perturbations that affect agricultural systems: noise when
    perturbations occur on a regular basis and are usually expected by farmers, shocks
    when perturbations are unusual and difficult to anticipate, cycles when the variation
    is due to cyclical changes, and trends when the change is gradual over time. In
    terms of trends, global warming is expected to impact agricultural activities
    gradually in the future: by the end of the twenty-first century, temperature is
    projected to rise by 1.4 to 5.8 °C while atmospheric CO2 concentration could reach
    three to four times the pre-industrial levels (IPCC 2014). In Europe, simulations
    of future climate have suggested an increase of average temperature and a slight
    decrease in rainfall (Trnka et al. 2011). Livestock systems may also be impacted
    by global warming, directly by the effects of heat on animal health, growth and
    reproduction and, indirectly, for herbivores, through impacts on the productivity
    of pastures and forage crops (Maracchi et al. 2005). Climate change is also expected
    to increase the risk of potential pest pressure in agriculture by providing more
    suitable environmental conditions for exotic pests to adapt across areas which
    were previously detrimental for their survival (Lamichhane et al. 2014). In this
    context of gradual changes, farmers and researchers can partly anticipate the
    impacts on agricultural activities through mitigation and adaptation programs
    (Olesen et al. 2011; Reidsma et al. 2010). For example, many research and implementation
    projects are currently dealing with adaptation strategies using local knowledge
    and low inputs for soil protection and water management in the context of climate
    change (Meynard et al. 2012). Beyond average trends, agricultural systems are
    also exposed to less predictable perturbations, such as climatic or economic shocks.
    These perturbations, exhibiting various intensities and durations, can also heavily
    impact agricultural activities. For example, climate variability is considered
    to explain part of wheat yield stagnation in Europe since the middle of the 1990s
    (Brisson et al. 2010; Moore and Lobell 2014), while food price volatility has
    negatively impacted farmers’ income stability in recent years (Huchet-Bourdon
    2011). In addition to these individual perturbations, local issues may also interact
    with global economic issues and further increase overall perturbations. For example,
    due to the specificities of the world agricultural market (inelastic demand for
    agricultural products, high seasonality and relatively long production period
    coupled with a short shelf-life for many agricultural products), a severe climatic
    shock, such as drought on grain production in an exporting country, may have significant
    repercussions on international, national and local markets and, therefore, on
    food security and political stability on local and global scales (Sternberg 2012).
    Furthermore, the relationship between agricultural systems and their external
    drivers requires that the intrinsic sensitivity of agricultural systems to exogenous
    perturbations be taken into account. For example, the impact of market volatility
    during the period 2007 to 2009 was particularly severe in Europe as the progressive
    change of CAP policies more directly exposed farmers to commodity price volatility
    (Enjolras et al. 2014). Moreover, there is also increasing evidence that the trend
    towards specialization and homogenization of genetic diversity across agricultural
    landscapes (Hoisington et al. 1999) is increasing the sensitivity of many agricultural
    systems around the world to various types of perturbation. In cropping systems,
    for example, genetic and crop uniformity over large areas tends to amplify pest
    invasions and outbreaks (Altieri and Nicholls 2004), while in animal husbandry,
    regional specialization of agricultural activities can increase sanitary risks
    by facilitating the spread of animal diseases Fèvre et al. (2006). In this context
    and in order to get a better understanding of the overall context in which agricultural
    systems are implemented, researchers have developed and used several concepts
    that deal with the response of agricultural systems when facing perturbations.
    In the next section, we introduce these different concepts, their historical backgrounds
    and their main differences according to how the relationship between agricultural
    systems and perturbations is expounded. 3 Conceptual frameworks We focus on four
    different concepts: stability, robustness, vulnerability and resilience. These
    four concepts are characterized by having a highly multidimensional nature and
    have been used in various papers related to agricultural systems. At first glance,
    they may appear to be linked by fuzzy boundaries and to be suitable in various
    contexts. Depending on authors, there is a call for more stable (Mishra and Sandretto
    2002), more robust (ten Napel et al. 2006), less vulnerable (Schröter et al. 2005)
    or more resilient (Naylor 2008) agricultural systems and sometimes a combination
    of all of these (de Goede et al. 2013; Tendall et al. 2015). In order to clarify
    the specificities of each concept and based upon the existing literature, we will
    present in this section their historical backgrounds and their main differences
    according to how they are used in papers related to agricultural systems. More
    precisely, each concept is discussed separately in order to highlight in which
    context it proved to be the most useful. As already pointed by Carpenter et al.
    (2001) concerning resilience, these multidimensional concepts acquire significance
    only if the studied object (the system and its boundaries), the type of output
    to be maintained and the nature of the perturbations are precisely defined. Thus,
    we will answer simple but essential questions when assessing each concept: what
    kind of system is studied, what kind of output is targeted and against what kind
    of perturbation? Table 1 summarizes the main elements for each concept and includes
    some examples from agricultural sciences. It may help readers to choose the most
    suitable concept according to the nature of their research questions. Table 1
    Summary of the main differences between the concepts of stability, robustness,
    vulnerability and resilience Full size table 3.1 The concept of stability The
    word stability originates from the Latin stabilis, meaning to stand firm or steady.
    It has been widely used in several scientific disciplines (mathematics, engineering,
    economic, social and natural sciences) to express the ability of an object to
    maintain equilibrium. In natural sciences, the concept of ecological stability
    was first defined as the constancy of a given attribute, regardless of the presence
    of disturbing factors (Justus 2008). For example, stable ecological communities
    were those with relatively constant population sizes and compositions (MacArthur
    1955). Later, the definition of ecological stability has been expanded to describe
    other properties of ecosystems, such as the ability to maintain ecological functions
    despite disturbances (Turner et al. 1993) or the ability to return to the initial
    equilibrium state (Ives and Carpenter 2007). This led to multiple definitions
    and interpretations of stability (Grimm and Wissel 1997) and sometimes to the
    feeling that it is defined in many ways depending on how scientists wish to look
    at the problem (Lin et al. 1986). In agricultural sciences, the concept of stability
    has been mainly used with the original meaning of ecological stability, i.e. as
    a criterion to measure the spatial or temporal constancy of specific features
    of agricultural systems (Fig. 2a). For example, the stability of genotypes has
    been widely used in plant breeding programs in order to identify genotypes that
    maintain specific features (e.g. yield or protein content in the grain) over a
    wide range of environments (Brancourt-Hulmel 1999; Sabaghnia et al. 2012). Based
    on genotype × environment interactions, two types of stability are sometimes distinguished:
    (i) static stability which refers to a genotype for which variance is small between
    different environments and (ii) dynamic stability which refers to a genotype for
    which the response to various environments is correlated to the mean response
    of all genotypes in the trial (Annicchiarico 2002). In other terms, the first
    type of stability focuses on constancy regardless of the variability in system
    environments whereas the second type of stability includes these environmental
    differences. Fig. 2 Illustration of stability, robustness, vulnerability and resilience
    concepts (adapted from Mumby et al. (2014) and de Goede et al. (2013)) Full size
    image Even though analysis of yield stability has been largely confined to multienvironment
    trials for comparing spatial stability of crop cultivars, stability analysis has
    also been applied to compare the temporal stability of different agronomic treatments
    in long-term experiments. For example, Berzsenyi et al. (2000) and Govaerts et
    al. (2005) implemented stability analysis to evaluate the effect of diverse crop
    rotations, fertilization treatments or tillage management techniques on crop yield
    stability. Considering these first elements, it appears that the concept of concept
    has been applied in agricultural studies with a meaning relatively close to ecological
    constancy, i.e. as the stability of agricultural outputs in time or space but
    without explicitly referring to the external drivers of change and to the occurrence
    of perturbations. Moreover, the concept of stability has been mainly applied to
    individual components (e.g. genotypes) or outputs (e.g. yield or income) of agricultural
    systems rather than through a more integrated approach. Hence, it may show a low
    potential for describing and explaining the behaviour of complex agricultural
    systems in a context of unpredictable changes. 3.2 The concept of robustness The
    word robustness comes from the Latin robustus, meaning strong. Widely used in
    statistics to refer to methods that are not affected by small deviations from
    model assumptions (Maronna et al. 2006), robustness also emerged in recent years
    as a major concept for analyzing the response of diverse objects facing perturbations.
    Industrialists and engineers first mobilized this concept in the early 1950s in
    order to optimize the manufacturing design of various devices and reduce their
    sensitivity to variation over which makers have little or no control (Taguchi
    and Clausing 1990). Subsequently, robustness theory was applied to various engineering
    processes, such as information networks, electronic circuits or flight control
    systems, in airplanes in order to make them capable of operating under a wide
    range of constraints (Fowlkes et al. 1995). More recently, the concept of robustness
    has also been used by biologists to describe the ability of living systems to
    maintain specific functionalities despite unpredictable environmental or genetic
    perturbations (Kitano 2004). For example, biological robustness can be illustrated
    by the ability of genomes to compensate for the loss of function in one gene by
    means of other copies of this gene (Gu et al. 2003). Based on these observations
    from engineering and biological sciences, robustness has been described as an
    intrinsic property of complex adaptive systems (Carlson and Doyle 2002) and as
    an important trait for the species’ capacity to evolve through natural selection
    (Wagner 2008). Comprising both technical and biological domains, agricultural
    systems can also be defined as complex and adaptive systems. Hence, the robustness
    concept was recently introduced into agricultural sciences and has been used in
    an increasing number of scientific papers to represent the complex interactions
    between the biotechnical factors of agricultural systems and external drivers
    of change (de Goede et al. 2013; ten Napel et al. 2006; Verhagen et al. 2010).
    In these papers, robustness has been mainly defined as the ability to minimize
    the variability of specific agricultural outputs despite the occurrence of explicitly
    defined perturbations (Fig. 2b). A large part of the literature recently devoted
    to this subject deals with robustness as a key breeding goal for animal farms
    (Knap 2005; Sauvant and Martin 2010; Star et al. 2008). The aim is to select animals
    that achieve a high production level in a wide diversity of environmental conditions,
    including stressful conditions. These stressors can be disease challenges, extreme
    temperatures, low-quality feed or challenges due to changes in housing or management
    (Merks et al. 2012). However, robustness has also been discussed in the context
    of cropping systems exposed to climatic or biotic perturbations. For example,
    Sabatier et al. (2013) compared the robustness of two contrasting types of management
    strategies for a cacao agroecosystem in Indonesia facing pest outbreaks and pesticide
    changes. Applied to agricultural systems facing an environment subject to perturbations,
    two forms of robustness are frequently distinguished and sometimes called, respectively,
    passive and active robustness: (i) resistance, i.e. the withstanding or tolerance
    of perturbations, and (ii) flexibility, i.e. the ability to adapt the configuration
    of the system in order to limit damage (ten Napel et al. 2006). For example, robustness
    on a pig farm level can include genetic components of heat stress tolerance in
    pigs (passive robustness) and temperature control systems to adjust indoor conditions
    in real time (active robustness). To conclude, we might say that robustness is
    a concept that goes further than stability through a more precise description
    of the interactions between agricultural systems (and their different components)
    and changes in environmental conditions. Due to its history, robustness appears
    to be a concept that better integrates biological and technical aspects of agricultural
    systems than stability. However, it rarely takes into consideration the social
    aspects of agricultural systems. 3.3 The concept of vulnerability The term vulnerability
    originates from the Latin word vulnus, meaning injury. Vulnerability thus refers
    to a state of fragility, a disposition to be hurt. This concept started to be
    used in the 1970s by geographers and social scientists in risk management issues
    to describe the fragility of certain communities or countries facing severe environmental
    or socio-economic risks, such as earthquakes (Blaikie et al. 1994) or food exchange
    crises (Watts and Bohle 1993). In the decade after 2000, the use of the vulnerability
    concept increased sharply with its adoption by the Intergovernmental Panel on
    Climate Change (IPCC) to assess the potential impacts of global warming at regional
    and global levels (Mc Carthy et al. 2001). As a result, vulnerability recently
    became a very central focus of the global change science research community for
    discussing and defining adaptation and mitigation plans (Downing et al. 2005).
    Based on the seminal work by IPCC, the vulnerability concept benefits from a highly
    operational framework to describe the relationship between the studied system
    and its environment (Adger 2006; Luers et al. 2003; Paavola 2008; Turner et al.
    2003). This framework usually distinguishes between three distinct elements (Fig.
    2c): (i) the level of exposure (i.e. the frequency, intensity and duration of
    perturbations affecting the studied system), (ii) the level of sensitivity (i.e.
    the degree to which the studied system is affected by exposure to perturbations)
    and (iii) the adaptive capacity (i.e. the ability of the studied system to deal
    with perturbations and increase the extent of variability that it can cope with).
    This operational framework of vulnerability has allowed its use in several fields,
    including agriculture for which it has been applied at various spatial scales
    (from farms to countries) but with an emphasis on the regional level (Reidsma
    and Ewert 2008; Simelton et al. 2009). The vulnerability of agricultural systems
    has mainly been studied with regard to the exposure to climatic perturbations,
    such as temperature changes (Luers et al. 2003), drought (Simelton et al. 2009)
    or floods (McLeman and Smit 2006; Silva and Lucio 2014). It has also been used
    to describe the response of agricultural systems exposed to diverse socio-economic
    changes, such as market fluctuations (Luers et al. 2003) or land use changes (Metzger
    et al. 2006). Sensitivity level generally refers to biotechnical or socio-economic
    factors that are intrinsic to agricultural systems and interact with external
    perturbations to amplify or reduce their impacts. For example, the level of sensitivity
    of a crop to drought depends to a high degree on soil characteristics and access
    to irrigation (Wilhelmi and Wilhite 2002). At regional level, the level of sensitivity
    of Indian farmers to international trade has been evaluated as a function of crop
    productivity and distance to major ports (O’Brien et al. 2004). The third factor
    of vulnerability, the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems, is usually described
    as the system’s ability to design and implement effective changes so as to reduce
    the impacts of harmful perturbations. In practice, adaptive capacity represents
    the set of natural, financial, institutional or human resources that agricultural
    systems can mobilize for coping with constraints and overcoming them (Brooks and
    Adger 2005). Hence, the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems encompasses
    both internal and external factors that can be used to deal with a changeable
    environment. For example, Tengö and Hammer (2003) analyzed the role of both management
    practices and the institutional framework for promoting the adaptive capacity
    of northern Tanzanian agro-pastoralists. Thus, vulnerability can be seen as a
    concept mainly focused on the assessment of the potential impacts of perturbations
    and on the target measures needed to reduce them. Compared to the concepts of
    stability and robustness, vulnerability appears to be a broader concept that encompasses
    the biotechnical and social factors of agricultural systems. It benefits from
    an operational framework that simplifies its use in various agricultural contexts,
    including institutional, social and financial determinants. 3.4 The concept of
    resilience The word resilience comes from the Latin resilio, meaning to rebound.
    Resilience was originally used in material and psychology sciences to describe
    the resistance of materials to physical shocks (Winson 1932) and the ability of
    individuals to cope with adversity, trauma or other significant sources of stress
    (Murphy 1974), respectively. In ecology, Holling (1973) popularized this term
    by defining the resilience of ecological systems as a measure of their persistence
    when confronted by unpredictable perturbations and of their ability to absorb
    change. Subsequently, the concept of resilience has been increasingly adopted
    as a generic approach to describe social-ecological systems as complex entities
    which are continually transforming themselves through cycles of change (Carpenter
    et al. 2001; Folke et al. 2010; Holling 2005). Based on extensive literature from
    various scientific backgrounds, resilience has been variously characterized as
    a loosely organized cluster of concepts (Carpenter and Brock 2008), a collection
    of ideas (Anderies et al. 2006) or a way of enabling exchanges across disciplines
    (Brand and Jax 2007). A first part of this literature mainly focuses on the “specific”
    meaning of resilience and is relatively close to the concepts of robustness and
    vulnerability. In such cases, resistance to perturbations and rate of recovery
    after their occurrence are considered as key aspects of resilience (Holling 1996).
    Specific resilience has been used, for example, on vegetative systems to study
    the rate of recovery after a fire (Lavorel 1999) or other natural hazards (MacGillivray
    and Grime 1995). Accordingly, it has been discussed for particular aspect of socio-ecological
    systems and for well-characterized perturbations, such as storms, earthquakes,
    floods and fires, for which existing knowledge provides a basis for building specified
    resilience (Carpenter et al. 2012). Another part of recent literature was more
    oriented towards the “general” meaning of resilience, i.e. the capacity of socio-ecological
    systems to adapt and transform in response to unfamiliar, unexpected and extreme
    shocks (Holling 2005). In such papers, general resilience is studied through the
    way that socio-ecological systems persist and innovate when facing unknown perturbations
    (Walker and Salt 2006). This second aspect of resilience is more difficult to
    apprehend because it refers to potential changes outside the scope of experience.
    For example, it has been used to study how socio-ecological systems are transforming
    themselves in order to continue to achieve specific goals, to better anticipate
    critical transitions in the future (Scheffer et al. 2012) and improve conservation
    plans (Standish et al. 2014). Resilience thinking, referring both to specific
    and general aspects of resilience, has been applied to a wide variety of social-ecological
    systems, such as everglades (Gunderson et al. 2002), marine ecosystems (Mumby
    et al. 2014) and forests (Parrott and Meyer 2012) but less frequently to agricultural
    systems. This might be explained by marked differences between agricultural and
    other socio-ecological systems, such as a smaller spatial scale, a high controllability
    of the ecological structure and processes on the farm by human activities, and
    the strong influence of economic drivers to ensure both the short-term and long-term
    economic survival of agricultural systems (Darnhofer 2010). Moreover, despite
    some extreme examples such as the Dust Bowl period in the 1930s in North America,
    after which farmers fundamentally changed their practices and adopted planting
    and plowing methods that ensured a better conservation of the soil, critical transformations
    of agricultural systems are not easy to analyze, particularly over short time
    periods. Nevertheless, despite these differences, the resilience concept has recently
    been applied to several studies dealing with the behaviour of agricultural systems
    facing various kinds of perturbation. Reflecting the contrasting understandings
    of this concept, the resilience of agricultural systems has been used in several
    ways: sometimes to measure the degree of resistance to shock in the face of economic
    (Abson et al. 2013) or climatic perturbations (Keil et al. 2008), but more frequently
    as the ability of agricultural systems to preserve their intrinsic functions through
    flexibility (Astigarraga and Ingrand 2011; Carlisle 2014) and plasticity (Rodriguez
    et al. 2011). In these cases, resilience is mainly used to discuss the factors
    that build the ability of agricultural systems to respond to changes, to reorganize
    their structure, to anticipate future changes and to take advantage of new opportunities
    (Folke et al. 2002). Resilience is probably the broadest concept among the four
    discussed in this paper. Applied to agricultural systems, it appears to be a heuristic
    framework that is most relevant on a long-term basis in order to describe and
    understand farm transformations over periods of time marked by significant economic,
    environmental or sanitary crises (van der Leeuw and Aschan-Leygonie 2000). It
    embeds both a timescale approach and a recovery process (Fig. 2d). Hence, contrary
    to the concept of vulnerability which focuses on the direct impacts of specific
    perturbations on a given feature of the system, the resilience concept mostly
    focuses on the consequences of one to several perturbations, including unpredictable
    ones, on the overall trajectory of the system (Mathevet and Bousquet 2014). 4
    From concepts to assessment in agricultural systems Based on review literature
    concerning stability, robustness, vulnerability and resilience, it appears that
    the research community has produced an insightful and extensive literature in
    recent years to describe and understand better the behaviour of various systems,
    including agricultural systems, in a context of unpredictable change. However,
    operationalization of these concepts into empirical assessments remains limited
    due to their multidimensional nature and because they are not directly observable
    phenomena (Callo-Concha and Ewert 2014). The situation is even more complicated
    when assessments are extended from time-limited events, such as drought, to gradual
    perturbations such as climate change. Hence, there is an urgent need to have a
    better knowledge of the models and metrics available to quantify the ability of
    agricultural systems to cope with various types of perturbation. In this section,
    we review existing approaches that have been used in empirical studies to quantify
    the stability, robustness, vulnerability and resilience of agricultural systems.
    These approaches are classified in three categories according to the system level
    at which they were used: (i) approaches focusing on the variability of agricultural
    outputs regardless of the context of perturbations, (ii) approaches focusing on
    the relationship between agricultural outputs and perturbations and (iii) approaches
    including a broader scale and taking into consideration the adaptive capacity
    of agricultural systems. We illustrate and discuss these different approaches
    through the description of some case studies. 4.1 Variability of agricultural
    outputs The first approach, and probably the simplest one, quantifies the ability
    of agricultural systems to cope with a changeable environment by characterizing
    agricultural outputs and their variability across large environmental (time, space,
    management practices) series. This approach has been used in various studies and
    can be carried out using different statistical methods. A first method is to quantify
    the statistical deviation of agricultural outputs from the average or median and
    can be undertaken using common indices of statistical dispersal (e.g. standard
    deviation, coefficient of variation, interquartile range). For example, Abson
    et al. (2013) used the coefficient of variation of economic returns to study the
    impact of landscape diversity on economic “resilience” in the UK between 1996
    and 2010. Other methods focus more on the behaviour of agricultural systems facing
    rare but extreme perturbations. These methods are mainly used in risk assessment
    studies (Iglesias and Quiroga 2007; Luo et al. 2009) and are usually based on
    the analysis of output anomaly distribution. For example, Cernay et al. (2015)
    analyzed the yield anomaly distribution of diverse grain legumes over the period
    1961–2013 in order to compare variability in legume yields across Europe and the
    Americas. More precisely, they used value at 10th percentile risk as a measure
    to assess in which countries legume yield losses have been the largest over this
    period. Lastly, other methods focus on the probability of achieving farmers’ goals
    and can be measured as the probability that agricultural outputs remain above
    a certain threshold. For example, Sabatier et al. (2015) used a stochastic model
    of grassland dynamics to measure, for various grazing strategies, the likelihood
    of fulfilling the feeding requirements of grazing animals. They quantified it
    as the percentage of weather sequences for which the grass resource was sufficient
    to feed the herd present on the grasslands every day. Finally, this first approach
    is relatively close to the stability concept because it does not explicitly characterize
    and take into account the intensity and variability of perturbations that affect
    agricultural systems. It only describes a part of the ability to cope with an
    environment subject to perturbations, and it does not deal satisfactorily with
    the ability of agricultural systems to resist and adapt to specific perturbations.
    4.2 Relationship between agricultural outputs and perturbations This second approach
    focuses on the response of agricultural systems to specific perturbations and
    has been used in various studies, referring both to robustness (Mosnier et al.
    2009) and vulnerability frameworks (Simelton et al. 2009). More precisely, this
    approach is associated with the notion of resistance that is frequently used in
    those two frameworks to refer to a low sensitivity of agricultural outputs to
    environmental system conditions. As a result, resistance is measured with respect
    to specific perturbations affecting agricultural systems. Indeed, this approach
    requires the characterization and quantification of the intensity of perturbations
    that affect agricultural systems (Li et al. 2009; Wu and Wilhite 2004). For example,
    Simelton et al. (2009) measured a drought index to assess the resistance of agricultural
    production in China to water deficit. The drought index was quantified as a negative
    rainfall anomaly, i.e. by the ratio between average amount of rainfall between
    1960 and 2011 and the actual amount of rainfall for each year. In livestock systems,
    perturbations can refer to changes in environmental conditions. For example, the
    variation in the herd environment of dairy cows (Windig et al. 2006) and breeding
    sows (Herrero-Medrano et al. 2015) has also been studied to measure the resistance
    of these livestock systems to changes in environmental conditions. Once perturbations
    have been characterized and quantified, the resistance of agricultural outputs
    to changes in environmental conditions is usually assessed through regression
    methods. This method has been used by various authors to study the relationship
    between agricultural outputs and perturbations which are highly correlated, such
    as yield and drought (Luers et al. 2003) or farmers’ income and price volatility.
    For example, Mosnier et al. (2009) studied the sensitivity of farmers’ incomes
    to climatic and economic perturbations in France on a panel of 55 farms. Using
    multiple linear regressions, they identified the influence of stocking rates and
    length of production cycles on the sensitivity of livestock systems to weather
    and beef price variation. In Nicaragua, Holt-Giménez (2002) has studied the resistance
    of more than 800 farmers after Hurricane Mitch. He discriminated “conventional”
    and “agroecological” farms in order to study, under different levels of storm
    intensity, the differences of response on several indicators (e.g. erosion or
    economic returns). He showed that patterns of resistance are not easy to describe
    and include complex interactions and thresholds. However, the differences in favour
    of agroecological plots tended to increase with increasing levels of storm intensity,
    increasing slope and increasing years under agroecological practices. Despite
    its potential to assess quantitatively the response of agricultural outputs to
    specific changes in the system environment, this approach remains limited to biotechnical
    components of agricultural systems. In particular, social components, including
    adaptive capacity, of agricultural systems are difficult to consider in this approach.
    4.3 Multiscale and adaptive capacity assessment of agricultural systems In order
    to integrate the different components of agricultural systems, a third approach
    is frequently used. Contrary to the two previous ones, this approach focuses on
    the description of internal system features through a set of proxy indicators
    more than on the variability or resistance of agricultural outputs. This indicator-based
    approach is applicable to multiple scales and can include the adaptive capacity
    of agricultural systems (Darnhofer et al. 2010). Consequently, this approach has
    mostly been used for assessing and measuring vulnerability (Gbetibouo et al. 2010)
    and resilience (Quinlan et al. 2015) of agricultural systems rather than their
    stability or robustness. In this approach, indicators are generally chosen to
    describe key aspects of biotechnical and social components that are supposed to
    increase or decrease the ability of agricultural systems to cope with various
    perturbations. For example, Cabell and Oelofse (2012) compiled 13 behaviour-based
    indicators which cover different properties of agricultural systems, such as spatial
    and temporal heterogeneity across landscapes and the human resources available
    on farms. Systems in which these 13 indicators are positively evaluated are supposed
    to better resist and adapt to perturbations, while a negative evaluation of these
    indicators points to a need for intervention. Based on the vulnerability framework,
    Wiréhn et al. (2015) reviewed indicators of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive
    capacity. The latter ones describe socio-economic factors that can assist agricultural
    systems to adapt and rebound better after perturbations (e.g. farm income, farm
    size, crop diversification). Altieri et al. (2015) used indicators of soil conservation
    practices, crop diversity and food self-sufficiency to describe the adaptive capacity
    of various agroecological farms in Latin America. These indicators are frequently
    aggregated and their results displayed in geographic representations to improve
    the identification of the most vulnerable, or less resilient, areas within a territory
    (O’Brien et al. 2004; Wilhelmi and Wilhite 2002). This indicator based-approach
    has proven to be valuable for monitoring trends but, as reported by Wiréhn et
    al. (2015), is limited in its applicability by considerable subjectivity in the
    selection of variables and their relative weights and by the difficulty of testing
    and validating the different metrics. To conclude this section, it appears that
    various approaches are available to study the behaviour of agricultural systems
    in a more changeable environment. Despite their differences, these approaches
    can provide additional details and improve visibility of what improves the ability
    of agricultural systems to cope with unpredictable changes. In particular, they
    can provide complementary findings at different scales. In the next section, we
    review the main elements that emerge from researches completed to date. 5 Key
    levers for improving the ability of agricultural systems to cope with perturbations
    Based on previous sections, it appears that various concepts and methods have
    been mobilized in recent years to characterize and quantify the ability of agricultural
    systems to cope with a changeable environment. Despite fuzzy boundaries, these
    concepts have specific historical backgrounds and have been applied to describe
    different features and behaviours of agricultural systems. Based on literature
    focusing on conceptual definitions and empirical assessments in agricultural studies,
    some key levers are emerging as important properties for a transition towards
    more stable, more robust, less vulnerable or more resilient agricultural systems.
    These generic elements are summarized in two categories: first, increasing the
    intrinsic diversity of agricultural systems and, second, increasing their adaptive
    capacity. 5.1 Increasing diversity at different levels Based on recent literature,
    many authors have emphasized the potential of increasing diversity in its various
    forms to improve the behaviour of agricultural systems when facing various perturbations
    (Altieri et al. 2015; Lin 2011; Naylor 2008; Østergård et al. 2009). This assumption
    relies on the hypothesis that implementing more diversity at different levels
    provides greater functional redundancy, i.e. system components and organization
    with overlapping functions to buffer year-to-year changes. However, diversification
    can be implemented in a variety of forms and at a variety of scales, allowing
    farmers to choose a strategy that both increases their ability to cope with perturbations
    and provides economic benefits Lin (2011). Among biological components, increasing
    genetic diversity through cultivars and animal breeds characterized by different
    agronomic features (e.g. diversity in earliness for cultivars; diversity in disease
    resistance for animal breeds) is supposed to spread the risks of failure by reducing
    the overall exposure to perturbations (Di Falco and Perrings 2003; Tooker and
    Frank 2012). Increasing breeding of cultivars and animals with distinctive traits
    is therefore becoming a research priority to allow farmers to choose biological
    components adapted to various contexts and perturbations (Casadebaig et al. 2014;
    Knap 2005). Similarly, increasing diversity at the species level by using crops
    characterized by different exposure periods and sensitivity features allows the
    spreading of risks through the entire cropping rotation (Lin 2011). Following
    seminal work by Hector et al. (1999), Tilman et al. (2006) showed that greater
    complementary and functional diversity among grassland species were able to stabilize
    annual plant production. As reported by Huyghe et al. (2014), the use of mixtures
    of grasses and legumes has been largely implemented in grasslands worldwide. Increasing
    diversity is also feasible by changing the nature of crop rotations and introducing
    perennial tree crops into annual cropping systems. Based on complementarities
    between annual crops and trees, agroforestry systems are characterized by a strong
    structural complexity (Jose 2009). These systems have demonstrated their capacity
    to provide a better protection for annual crops not only from habitual climatic
    perturbations (changes in temperature and precipitation), but also from extreme
    perturbations such as hurricanes (Lin 2011). At a larger scale, increasing diversity
    through regional landscape diversity is also a strategy for minimizing the impacts
    of perturbations on agricultural systems: Reidsma and Ewert (2008) showed that
    diversity in farm size and intensity (e.g. cultivar choice, fertilizer and pesticide
    use) reduces the regional vulnerability of wheat production to climate change.
    Abson et al. (2013) also found that land use diversification in the UK was positively
    correlated with the resilience of agricultural returns in the face of uncertain
    market and environmental conditions. Furthermore, preserving or increasing the
    diversity of agricultural systems can also maintain or stimulate various resources
    (technology, information and knowledge) at the territorial level that can be used
    by farmers in order to cope with current or future challenges (Nelson et al. 2007).
    In that sense, increasing diversity of agricultural systems can also improve their
    adaptive capacity. 5.2 Increasing the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems
    Cited mainly in robustness, vulnerability and resilience literature, adaptive
    capacity refers to the ability of agricultural systems to transform their nature
    or structure to cope with an ever-changing environment (Milestad et al. 2012).
    It focuses on ensuring sufficient room for manoeuvre, identifying transition capabilities
    and extending the degrees of freedom of agricultural systems. More often emphasized
    in livestock than in cropping systems (Blanc et al. 2010), adaptive capacity can
    be improved at different levels and in biological, technical and organizational
    components. Applied to biological components, adaptive capacity has been widely
    discussed in robustness literature as a key breeding goal for animal breeding
    (Knap 2005). It refers to the ability of animals to adjust their behaviour to
    exogenous constraints. For example, the adaptive capacity of dairy cows may refer
    to their ability to mobilize body reserves during specific periods in order to
    support milk production. Blanc et al. (2010) showed that animals in extensive
    livestock systems are frequently adjusting their behaviour and physiological responses
    to cope with low-feed-intake periods. Such ability to adjust their behaviour varies
    between breeds and highlights their ability to produce and maintain their reproduction
    in an unstable environment. Various research programs have focused on increasing
    these properties in various plants and animals (Knap 2005; ten Napel et al. 2006),
    but some authors have underlined a potential trade-off between intrinsic adaptive
    capacity and the productivity of livestock systems (Sabatier et al. 2015). On
    a larger scale, improving the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems can be
    based on improvements in the design of agricultural systems and the implementation
    of technical components designed to help farmers to adjust day-to-day operations.
    For example, design can rely on the choice of renewable materials, such as bedding
    material, feeder type for livestock and new fertilizers and decision support tools
    in crops to prevent abiotic or biotic risks. Several tools are already available
    to inform farmers about pest outbreaks, soil water availability or nitrogen nutrition
    index, and farmers can opportunistically respond to variability by adjusting pesticide,
    irrigation or fertilizer uses (Mulla 2013). In livestock systems, increasing adaptive
    capacity can also refer to organizational management and to the adaptation in
    time and space of feed management to secure feed supply, especially in grassland
    systems that can be highly sensitive to drought periods (Mosnier et al. 2009;
    Tichit et al. 2004). By introducing more flexibility in agricultural systems,
    these technical and decision making components emerge as important characteristics
    of agricultural systems which consciously or automatically adjust options to reliable
    clues from the environment in which they operate (Rodriguez et al. 2011). Beyond
    farm scale, adaptive capacity can also be improved through collective actions
    between stakeholders that voluntarily share their goals and production tools.
    Ireland and Thomalla (2011) showed that collective action between farms can promote
    the establishment of social networks and enhance the ability of local stakeholders
    to cope with a changeable environment. It may also increase their financial resources
    which can be used during times of hardship. These new forms of cooperation between
    farms are also helping them to establish new relationships with downstream industries
    and to adapt better to changes in market context. 6 Conclusion The context of
    increasing uncertainty induces major challenges for agricultural systems. The
    need for more sustainable agricultural systems in an increasingly changeable environment
    implies a shift from the aim of maximizing agricultural outputs in a non-disturbed
    environment to the aim of maintaining desired levels of outputs in a context of
    unpredictable perturbations. For agronomists, it entails the need for a better
    characterization and quantification of the ability of agricultural systems to
    cope with unpredictable changes. A literature review of stability, robustness,
    vulnerability and resilience highlighted several differences and complementarities
    between these four concepts. Depending on the system’s scale, the type of agricultural
    output studied and the kind of perturbation, each concept can be meaningful and
    provide insights to better characterize agricultural system behaviour in the face
    of perturbations. This literature review also provided insights into the various
    methods available to quantify these properties in agricultural systems, from the
    analysis of the variability and resistance of agricultural outputs to multiscale
    and indicator-based assessments. Based on this literature, increasing diversity
    and adaptive capacity of agricultural systems emerge as key drivers for increasing
    the ability of agricultural systems to cope with different types of perturbation.
    However, further empirical studies are still needed to test and validate these
    methods and results in various contexts and across various spatial and temporal
    scales. Further research is needed to work out to what extent and based on which
    value judgements the urge for more stable, more robust, less vulnerable or more
    resilient agricultural production systems is moving research towards a course
    of breeding stable cultivars, towards breeding robust cows, towards protection
    and exposure avoidance or towards resilience and adaptation. Of particular interest
    are the trade-offs involved. References Abson DJ, Fraser EDG, Benton TG (2013)

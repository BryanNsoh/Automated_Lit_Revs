    \ the literature on applications of remote sensing for monitoring soil- and\n\
    crop- water status for irrigation purposes. The review is organized into two main\
    \ sections: (1) sensors\nand platforms applied to irrigation studies and (2) remote\
    \ sensing approaches for precision irrigation\nto estimate crop water status,\
    \ evapotranspiration, infrared thermography, soil and crop characteristics\nmethods.\
    \ Recent literature reports several remote sensing (RS) approaches to monitor\
    \ crop water\nstatus in the cultivated environment. Establishing the right amount\
    \ of water to supply for different\nirrigation strategies (maximization of yield\
    \ or water use efﬁciency (WUE)) for a large number of\ncrops is a problem that\
    \ remains unresolved. For each crop, it will be necessary to create a stronger\n\
    connection between crop-water status and crop yield.\nKeywords: crop water status;\
    \ water use efﬁciency (WUE); platforms; sensors; evapotranspiration\n(ET); Crop\
    \ water stress index (CWSI); time-temperature threshold (TTT); vegetation indices\
    \ (VIs)\n1. Introduction\nFood is the basic and compulsory human requirement.\
    \ It is expected that limited land and\ninadequate water resources will negatively\
    \ impact the expected increase in demand for food crops\nduring the next ﬁfty\
    \ years [1–3]. Subject to scenarios used, and assumptions and models employed,\n\
    different forecasts have been made for food and agricultural production and related\
    \ irrigation water\nneeds. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) projections\
    \ indicated a growth rate of world\nconsumption of agricultural products of 1.1%\
    \ per year for the period from 2005 to 2050. In order to\nmeet this projected\
    \ global demand, agricultural production would have to increase by 60% from 2005\n\
    to 2050 [4,5].\nProduction of food requires water. Since water resources are a\
    \ limiting factor for human actions,\nWater Use Efﬁciency (WUE) will be a crucial\
    \ factor [6]. For these reasons, the European Parliament,\nin agreement with the\
    \ Horizon 2020 program, has coined the phrase “produce more with less” [7].\n\
    Agriculture is the main user of water worldwide, accounting for about 70% of total\
    \ water withdrawals,\nincluding the water used in livestock and aquaculture production\
    \ [8]. Furthermore, it is expected that\nthis sector will witness increased water\
    \ consumption of about 20% by the year 2025 [9]. Thus, it is\nwidely expected\
    \ that the competition for water resources in many regions will increase. To meet\
    \ the\nincreasing population’s demands for food and for water, it is critical\
    \ to improve agricultural water\nproductivity, or economic yield per volume of\
    \ water used [1,10].\nForty percent of total agricultural production comes from\
    \ the 20% of the land that is irrigated [11].\nFarmers in developing countries\
    \ have to improve agronomic and water management practices in\norder to increase\
    \ WUE in all agroecosystems (from fully-rainfed to fully-irrigated farming systems).\n\
    Pereira et al., [12] reported that the above goal is chieﬂy important where water\
    \ is a scarce commodity\n(arid and semiarid regions). In these regions, it will\
    \ be crucial to increase water productivity rather\nthan maximizing crop yield.\
    \ Molden et al. [13] suggested, “The adoptions of techniques to improve water\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40; doi:10.3390/horticulturae3020040\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/horticulturae\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n2 of 36\nproductivity will require an enabling policy\
    \ and an institutional environment that aligns the incentives of\nproducers, resource\
    \ managers and society, and provides a mechanism for dealing with trade-offs”.\
    \ Irrigation\nwater management is sustainable if it realizes the objectives of\
    \ preserving the natural environment\nand sustaining irrigated agriculture for\
    \ food security. Appropriate irrigation practices are aimed at\nimproving WUE\
    \ in order to save water and maintain satisfactory yields [14].\nPainter and Carren\
    \ [15] emphasized the importance of reducing water losses below the root zone,\n\
    improving yield and crop quality, conserving the resource base, and lowering the\
    \ risk of salinization\nof groundwater to enhance sustainability. The authors\
    \ also pointed out that “these gains can only be\nachieved when all elements of\
    \ precision operate synergistically within a given environment”.\nFor improving\
    \ WUE at the regional level, Batchelor [16] suggested four methods of agronomic\n\
    improvements: (1) rely on improved crop husbandry; (2) introduce varieties with\
    \ higher productivity;\n(3) maximize cropped area during periods of low potential\
    \ evapotranspiration and (4) when rainfall is\nhighest, promote water recycling.\n\
    Wallace and Batchelor [17] reported four categories (agronomic, technical, managerial,\
    \ and\ninstitutional) for improving the efﬁciency of irrigation. Technical solutions\
    \ may improve irrigation\nuniformity, reduce leaching, and lead to adoption of\
    \ irrigation practices that increase rainfall\neffectiveness. Among managerial\
    \ improvements, the authors highlighted the implementation of\nirrigation scheduling\
    \ systems based on crop demand. The institutional improvements “rely on the user\n\
    involvement in scheme operation and maintenance; introduction of water pricing\
    \ and legal frameworks to provide\nincentives for efﬁcient water use and disincentives\
    \ for inefﬁcient use; introduction of integrated catchment\nmanagement; improved\
    \ training and extension”. In 2005, Johansson [6] emphasized the importance at\
    \ the\nfarm level of the extension services for improving information or of cheap\
    \ credit for adjusting to the\nchanging environments associated with water policy\
    \ reforms (water-pricing reforms, particularly).\nBecause more efﬁcient irrigation\
    \ practices can optimize WUE [18], and drip irrigation reduced\ncrop evapotranspiration\
    \ losses and runoff [19–21], the technology was appropriate for applying water\n\
    to orchards and vegetables [22]. Proper irrigation (timing and amount) increased\
    \ the crop WUE and\ncrop yield [23]. In contrast, improper irrigation can lead\
    \ to the onset of crop water deﬁcits causing\nwater and nutrient deﬁciencies that\
    \ reduce yield [23,24]. Nevertheless, regardless of the strategy\nengaged, the\
    \ beneﬁts of irrigation scheduling can be reached only by applying the exact amount\
    \ of\nwater required [25]. Raine et al. [26] deﬁne precision irrigation as “the\
    \ accurate and precise application\nof water to meet the speciﬁc requirements\
    \ of individual plants or management units and minimize\nadverse environmental\
    \ impact”. Monitoring water use and crop water status in the ﬁeld is important\n\
    for developing effective precautions, and for this purpose, some indicators are\
    \ required [27]. A very\nlarge body of research, spanning almost four decades,\
    \ has demonstrated that much of the required\nagricultural information can be\
    \ derived from remotely sensed data [28] starting from crop water status\ndetection.\
    \ IN order to develop effective irrigation strategies, it is necessary to identify\
    \ the appropriate\nindicators for monitoring crop water status at the farm level\
    \ [27]. For these purposes, the required\nagricultural information may be derived\
    \ from remotely sensed data [28].\n2. Scope of the Review\nThe applications of\
    \ remote sensing to irrigation monitoring and management are reviewed\nherein.\
    \ The assessment of the ideal crop water requirement is indispensable for several\
    \ objectives\nlinked to agronomic, economic, and environmental issues: (i) maximize\
    \ crop yield (the ’yield gap’);\n(ii) stabilize production by adopting a safeguard\
    \ against the vagaries of weather; (iii) ameliorate crop\nquality; (iv) save water;\
    \ (v) limit onset of diseases; and (vi) limit groundwater pollution caused by\n\
    N leaching losses. A seventh (vii) crucial point is the ’yield gap’ of the environment\
    \ under study.\nThis means deﬁning the potential and constraints of the ﬁeld environment\
    \ (sub optimal management,\ninappropriate technology, and/or lack of training\
    \ of farmers). This is possible when water constraints\non crop production are\
    \ removed by using appropriate irrigation scheduling for getting more crop\nyield\
    \ per drop of water [9,29], contributing to social growth of the irrigated area.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n3 of 36\nIn 2008, Fereres [8] called for a more efﬁcient\
    \ and sustainable irrigation than in the past, at a\ntime when the rate of irrigation\
    \ was expected to slow down, and when the investments in irrigation\nand drainage\
    \ were on the decline. Fereres also emphasized challenges in irrigated agriculture\
    \ due to\nmodernization of irrigation networks and management, the improvement\
    \ of water institutions, and\nthe responses to periodic droughts. The last point\
    \ has imposed the introduction of new water saving\ntechnologies in horticulture.\n\
    A holistic approach is necessary for moving from a traditional approach to precision\
    \ irrigation,\ndeﬁned as site-speciﬁc irrigation management that relies on the\
    \ variable application of water according\nto soil and crop variability. It is\
    \ a potential solution for increasing productivity and reducing the\nenvironmental\
    \ impact of irrigated agriculture. A holist approach needs a deep and precise\
    \ knowledge\nof the crop water requirements and the cultivated environment. The\
    \ innovative deﬁcit irrigation and\npartial root drying management strategies\
    \ [29] have encouraged the development of new methods for\nmonitoring water stress\
    \ (abiotic). Fernández [30] focused on plant-based methods that integrate the\n\
    soil and atmospheric water status and the plant response to the surrounding conditions.\n\
    The present review describes the role of remote sensing with respect to crop water\
    \ status, its\nsurface energy balance, the relationship between surface temperature\
    \ and remotely sensed vegetation\nindices, and WUE and evapotranspiration. This\
    \ review is limited to ﬁeld-key studies, and presents\napplications of remote\
    \ sensing for managing irrigation and water resources for meeting the current\
    \ and\nfuture challenges of agricultural water resources management. A list of\
    \ references is presented\nas a good resource for any who are interested in remote\
    \ sensing applied to irrigation studies.\nThe review is organized into the following\
    \ main sections: (1) Sensors and platforms applied to\nirrigation studies; (2)\
    \ Remote sensing approaches for precision irrigation for estimating crop water\n\
    status, evapotranspiration, infrared thermography, and soil and crop characteristics.\n\
    3. Sensors and Platforms\nJensen et al. [31] reported that the ﬁrst aerial images\
    \ were taken by a camera mounted on a balloon\naround 1859. From the very beginning\
    \ of satellite-based remote sensing in the 1970s, the use of remote\nsensing for\
    \ terrestrial applications has increased tremendously [32]. Remote sensing is\
    \ the acquisition\nof information about an object, or event through the analysis\
    \ of data acquired obtained by a device\nwithout contact with the target under\
    \ investigation [33]. The term remote sensing includes all the\ntraditional primary\
    \ mapping data acquisition technologies [34].\nRemote-sensing instruments are\
    \ designed to identify various wavelengths of the electromagnetic\nspectrum referred\
    \ to as a “band” or “channel”. Each instrument is characterized by a speciﬁc number\n\
    and widths of wavelengths detected; some instruments detect discrete bands, while\
    \ others detect\nfairly narrow wavelengths or broader bands (multispectral, visible\
    \ and near-infrared wavelengths,\nmicrowave, thermal sensing systems) [35–37].\n\
    Remote sensing is able to identify spectral signatures of all surfaces and objects.\
    \ Sensors can sense\ntargets with a speciﬁc spatial resolution of image data deﬁned\
    \ by the smallest spatial area sampled or\nviewed. Digital images are made up\
    \ of pixels, each pixel characterized by speciﬁc spectral and spatial\nattributes\
    \ [38], as the intensity of reﬂectance or emittance measured by a sensor [39].\
    \ Spatial resolution\ncorresponds to the spatial area each displayed or printed\
    \ pixel represents.\nWhen the time image was shot (day or year) is a crucial point\
    \ in interpreting remotely sensed data\nanalysis [40]. If the same area is imaged\
    \ in the morning and late afternoon, a greater number of features\nwith different\
    \ orientations may be discerned than if the area is only imaged in the morning\
    \ [41]; this\nis especially true when interpreting vegetation classes. Multi-temporal\
    \ images are taken at different\ntimes to monitor changes in the environment and\
    \ to analyze numerous processes [42,43]. The temporal\ndynamics may range from\
    \ hours to a number of years. Sexton et al. [44] and Guerschman et al. [45]\n\
    reported that “to assess changes over a time sequence accurately, effects in the\
    \ data not caused by true\nenvironmental changes (such as differing atmospheric\
    \ conditions and sun or view angle positions)\nmust ﬁrst be accounted for”.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n4 of 36\nOther sensors are deﬁned as bidirectional,\
    \ due to the illumination angle at which the energy\nsource strikes the target,\
    \ and the position (angle) at which the instrument receives the emitted or\nthe\
    \ reﬂected energy (called the view angle) as described by Schowengerdt [46] and\
    \ Campbell and\nWynn [47].\n3.1. Remote Sensing Sensors\nDifferent remote sensing\
    \ sensors have been developed for monitoring crop growth and yield, as\nwell as\
    \ the spatial variability within ﬁelds. Many factors may affect crop growth and\
    \ yield variability,\nsuch as soil characteristics, soil fertility, soil moisture,\
    \ canopy volume, biomass and architecture, water\ncontent, and biotic and abiotic\
    \ stress. Different types of sensors can monitor and measure these factors;\n\
    Lee et al. [48] discussed electronic sensors, spectroradiometers, machine vision,\
    \ multispectral and\nhyperspectral sensors, thermal sensors, and machine olfaction\
    \ systems. A detailed review on sensors\nrelated to agricultural crop was reported\
    \ by Ruiz-Altisent et al. [49]. The authors provided an overview\nof sensing technologies\
    \ and application as: (i) electromagnetic sensors, spectroscopic sensors, and\n\
    computer vision; (ii) mechanical contact and acoustic sensors; (iii) biosensors;\
    \ and (iv) wireless-sensor\nnetworks. Wang et al. [50] studied recent development\
    \ and future perspective of wireless sensors in\nagriculture and the food industry.\n\
    Sensors can be divided into several broad categories of basic sensor system types\
    \ such as active and\npassive. Passive sensors (photographic, electro-optic radiometers,\
    \ passive microwave systems visible,\ninfrared, and thermal imaging systems, etc.)\
    \ are the most common for vegetation correlated remote\nsensing. These sensors\
    \ provide helpful information for crop monitoring, but their major limitation\n\
    is the strong relationship among data acquisition and lighting (time of day and\
    \ year; latitude) and\nweather conditions (cloud cover). Data from passive sensors\
    \ requires accurate measurements of solar\nradiation and correction for “atmospheric\
    \ effects” [34,40].\nActive sensors use an artiﬁcial source of energy; in active\
    \ remote sensing, humans can control the\nnature (wavelength, power, duration)\
    \ of the source energy. Active sensors (Radar systems, LiDAR)\ndo not need sun\
    \ light and perfect weather conditions (less dependence on environmental factors);\n\
    therefore, they can be more dedicated and targeted toward the remote sensing objectives\
    \ even at night\nor under adverse conditions (haze, clouds, rain, etc.) [34,40].\n\
    3.2. Remote Sensing Platforms\nThe platform on which a particular sensor is lodged\
    \ states the distance of the sensor from the\ntarget, timing, periodicity, location,\
    \ and extent of coverage of the acquired image. The detailed\ninformation obtained\
    \ is strictly related to the distance between the object of interest and the type\
    \ of\nplatform. Remote sensing platforms can be divided into three groups: satellite,\
    \ airborne and Unmanned\nAerial Vehicles (UAVs), and ground based solutions. According\
    \ to Matese et al. [51], each of these\nplatforms and sensors shows strengths\
    \ and weaknesses related to technological, operational and\neconomic factors.\n\
    3.2.1. Satellite\nSatellites can be classiﬁed by (i) altitude; (ii) orbital geometry\
    \ (geostationary, equatorial and sun\nsynchronous) and (iii) timing. Regarding\
    \ the ﬁrst point, there are space shuttles orbiting around\n250–300 km above the\
    \ earth; space stations orbiting from 300 to 400 km above; low level satellites\
    \ from\n700 to 1500 km above, and high-level satellites, about 36000 km above\
    \ the earth's surface. The ﬁrst\nremote sensing satellite appeared in 1960 for\
    \ meteorological purposes. Geostationary satellites have a\n24 h-period of rotation,\
    \ so they always stay over the same earth location. Usually, communications\n\
    and weather satellites have often-geostationary orbits, generally located over\
    \ the equator. To ensure\nrepeatable sun illumination conditions during speciﬁc\
    \ seasons, sun synchronous satellites have orbits\nnearly passing over the poles.\
    \ Sensor and orbital characteristics determine the frequency of data\nacquisition\
    \ (Table 1). The satellite frequency ranges from twice a day to every 16 days.\n\

    Toth and Jó´zków [34] reported on new satellite technologies related to microsatellites\
    \ and\nnanosatellites, which increment the number of observations by sharing the\
    \ same orbit. One of the\nﬁrst examples comes from Planet Labs, which launched\
    \ four prototype satellites in order to test the\nperformance of the system [34].\n\
    Satellite\nconstellations\n(Landsat,\nSPOT,\nGlobal\nNavigation\nSatellite\nSystem\n\
    and\nGeoEye/WorldView families;\nRapid Eye) have identical satellites positioned\
    \ on the same\norbit to diminish the revisit time [52,53].\nSatellites that operate\
    \ in dual mode are deﬁned as a constellation, such as GOCE and the dual\nGRACE\
    \ satellites launched in 2009 to measure the gravitational ﬁeld of the Earth [54].\n\
    In the recent past, satellites were characterized by a low spatial resolution\
    \ and were used for\nseveral purposes over large geographic areas, but were unable\
    \ to assess crop yield variability within\na ﬁeld [48]. Single satellite based\
    \ systems continue to improve in imaging performance, including\nbetter spatial\
    \ and spectral resolution as well as sensor agility, so in-track and cross-track\
    \ stereo capture\nis available [55]. Currently, new opportunities for mapping\
    \ and monitoring crop yield variability\nare provided by high-resolution satellite\
    \ sensors (e.g., SPOT 6 and 7, Ikonos, Quick-Bird) that have\nnarrowed the gap\
    \ between image by satellite and by airborne vehicles [56,57].\nLandsat series\
    \ from 1 to 7, for example, had a spatial resolution ranging from 30 to 79 m and\
    \ a\nradiometric resolution of 6–8 bits, usable to some extent for mapping water\
    \ quality parameters [58–61].\nLandsat 8 (12-bit radiometric resolution) is suitable\
    \ for remote sensing of water in lakes (even dark\nwith CDOM-rich); although the\
    \ revisit time of 16 days limits its use in routine monitoring of water\nbody\
    \ quality.\nSince\nsatellite\nmeasurements\nare\nnot\nsatisfactory\nfor\nmonitoring\n\
    diurnal\nvariation,\nRoussel et al. [62] noted advantages from the use of electromagnetic\
    \ waves constantly released by the\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)\
    \ satellite constellations for retrieving different geophysical\nparameters of\
    \ the Earth's surface. For irrigation purposes, GNSS reﬂectometry (GNSS-R) system\
    \ is\nuseful for soil moisture monitoring, because it is able to monitor diurnal\
    \ variation [62].\nSatellite missions, labelled Sentinel 1 up to 5, were set up\
    \ for environmental monitoring [63].\nThe launch of Sentinel-2 in 2015 opened\
    \ a new era in remote sensing. This system has a medium spatial\nresolution, super-spectral\
    \ instrument with a ﬁeld of view of 290 km, a revisit capability of 5 days\n(two\
    \ satellites), a resolution of 10 m, 20 m and 60 m, and a moderately large band\
    \ set (13 spectral bands)\naiming to provide global land coverage. The mission\
    \ ensures continuity of the previous missions\n(Landsat and SPOT) and provides\
    \ geochemical and physical variables, land cover maps and land\nchange detection\
    \ maps. Its image spatial resolution (from 60 m to 10 m) allows the monitoring\
    \ of several\nsmall water bodies as reported by Toming et al. [64], who have shown\
    \ that Sentinel-2 was able to map\nwater quality. It may monitor Chlorophyll a\
    \ (Chl a) as an indicator of phytoplankton, Chromophoric\n(or colored) Dissolved\
    \ Organic Materials, and Dissolved Organic Material concentrations.\nImmitzer\
    \ et al. [65] have assessed the suitability of Sentinel 2 data in agriculture\
    \ for land cover\nclassiﬁcations. Results appeared encouraging, although the classiﬁcation\
    \ results for the pixel- and\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n7 of 36\nthe object-based\
    \ approach were not extremely high. The authors relied on the support of two twin\
    \ S2\nsatellites for consistently improving spectral and temporal information\
    \ with high spatial resolution.\nSaadi et al. [66] have conducted an experiment\
    \ on regional evapotranspiration and crop\nwater consumption estimated over an\
    \ irrigated area in Tunisia with the SAMIR model that used\nSPOT high-resolution\
    \ time series. The SAMIR model was calibrated with local evapotranspiration\n\
    measurements taken from ﬂux towers. It was validated at plot and perimeter scales\
    \ using known\nirrigation volumes. The objective of the work was to assess the\
    \ operational feasibility and accuracy\nof SAMIR outputs at plot and perimeter\
    \ scales, in a context of high land cover complexity (i.e., trees,\nwinter cereals,\
    \ summer vegetables) and limited data available for parameterization. The authors\n\
    concluded that acquisition frequency (ﬁve days) of the satellite Sentinel-2 would\
    \ not answer the\nproblem of cloudiness, even in semi-arid conditions, as in the\
    \ case of Tunisia. The authors suggested\nthe combination with Landsat8 or SPOT,\
    \ which have VIS-NIR high-resolution sensors. Using these\ntime series, including\
    \ clear images approximately every 20 days, would make it possible to estimate\n\
    irrigation volumes at perimeters scale. The seasonal volumes estimated by this\
    \ method appeared\nacceptable, even though results at ﬁner timescales (monthly\
    \ and below) need to be improved.\nA variety of variables (e.g., leaf chlorophyll\
    \ content, leaf water content, leaf area index) are\nproposed for Sentinel-2 as\
    \ inputs to earth system models. Van der Werff and van der Meer [63]\nsummarized\
    \ spectral position (λ) and bandwidth (∆λ), spatial resolution, heritage and purpose\
    \ of\nSentinel-2 bands, according to the Copernicus derived user requirements.\n\
    Escorihuela and Quintana-Seguí [67] reported recently on soil moisture measurements\
    \ by remote\nsensing at local and regional scales. Recent technical developments\
    \ have allowed the outgrowth\nof space borne L-band microwave radiometry. Two\
    \ satellite missions, the Soil Moisture and Ocean\nSalinity (SMOS, 2009) and the\
    \ Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP, 2015) provide global mapping of\nsurface\
    \ soil moisture based on radiometric measurements at L-band (21 cm, 1.4 GHz).\
    \ The authors\nfound SMOS to be the only satellite able to detect irrigation and\
    \ the only one that does not show clear\nvegetation or roughness effects and is\
    \ able to map irrigated areas. Entekhabi et al. [68] produced\ncomposited maps\
    \ of the difference between weekly mean soil moisture over one week, one month,\n\
    and three months.\nThe NASA report “Microwave Technologies Review and Strategy”\
    \ [69] contained an overview\nof technologies for Earth science measurements involving\
    \ passive microwave radiometry for soil\nmonitoring. The Soil Moisture Active\
    \ Passive mission goal was to produce global maps of surface\nsoil moisture at\
    \ low (36 km) and high resolution (9 km).\nThe mission was based on L-band\nradiometer\
    \ and radar/radiometer measurements for low and high-resolution maps, respectively.\n\
    The preliminary results of the Multi-Temporal Dual Channel Algorithm (MT-DCA)\
    \ for retrieving\n(i) soil moisture; (ii) Vegetation Optical Depth; and (iii)\
    \ scattering albedo estimates, from passive\nmicrowave measurements alone and\
    \ without reliance of a priori information were reported. At L-band,\nthe Vegetation\
    \ Optical Depth was related to total vegetation water content and albedo to structural\n\
    changes. The analysis of these two parameters, at different temporal and spatial\
    \ scales, disclosed the\npotential of L-band microwave sensors for ecological\
    \ studies on a global scale [70]. Kojima et al. [71]\nreport an estimate of Soil\
    \ Moisture Distributions across Small Farm Fields with ALOS/PALSAR.\nThe ALOS\
    \ (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) has an active microwave sensor; PALSAR (Phased\n\
    Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) has a ﬁne resolution of 6.5 m. Because\
    \ of the ﬁne resolution,\nPALSAR provides the possibility of estimating soil moisture\
    \ distributions in small farmlands. Making\nsuch small-scale estimates has not\
    \ been possible with traditional satellite remote sensing techniques.\n3.2.2.\
    \ Airborne Platforms\nAirborne platforms (from 50 m to 50 km) carry out downward\
    \ or sideward sensors to obtain\nearth’s surface images. Airborne platforms give\
    \ images with a spatial resolution of 20 cm or less, much\nhigher than satellite\
    \ maps, but they have low coverage area and high cost per unit area. For these\n\
    reasons, it is not proﬁtable to monitor and map large areas. Airborne missions\
    \ are one-time operations,\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n8 of 36\nwhereas satellites\
    \ provide continuous target monitoring [72]. The quality of images acquired may\
    \ be\ndegraded by factors that introduce blurring, improper focusing, atmospheric\
    \ scattering and target\nmotion [34,40]. The ﬁelds of application of airborne\
    \ remote sensing are numerous, such as biodiversity,\nbiogeochemical cycles, climate\
    \ change, eco-hydrology, infectious disease, land use, invasive species.\nFor\
    \ natural and agricultural environments, it is worth mentioning airborne remote\
    \ sensing studies\non vegetation: (i) cover amount; (ii) dominant type; (iii)\
    \ canopy structure (height and Leaf Area Index);\n(iv) crop status; (v) canopy\
    \ chemistry (nitrogen index); (vi) crop greenness; and (vii) crop health in\n\
    relation to topography (elevation, slope and aspect) [73–77].\nMost data seen\
    \ in Google Earth, and the imagery of towns and cities, are supplied by Bluesky\
    \ and\nDigitalGlobe, and are not taken from a satellite. On a plane or helicopter\
    \ it is simple to remove/replace\nthe old sensor with a new one that is more precise\
    \ and accurate. Furthermore, it is possible to take\nseveral ﬂights until the\
    \ proper and correct image is acquired. Moreover, a plane or helicopter, different\n\
    from satellites, can ﬂy with unfavorable weather conditions (high-level clouds).\
    \ Even imperfect images\ncan undergo a post-processing stage for correcting atmospheric\
    \ problems. Helicopters are usually used\nfor low altitude applications where\
    \ the ability to hover is required. Airborne hyperspectral imagery\nhas been evaluated\
    \ for estimating crop yields [78,79], green biomass [80], and crop disease [81].\n\
    In one of the ﬁrst examples of application of airborne imaging to crop farming,\
    \ Alvino and\nZerbi [82] set up an experimental ﬁeld capable of creating a continuous\
    \ gradient of water table level\nduring the rainy season. Four inclined water\
    \ tables were obtained (Figure 1). Figure 1b was taken\nin summer 1986 by an aircraft\
    \ with conventional imaging equipment. Figure 1c is the conversion of\nthe color\
    \ photo to grayscale image, and then conversion to false colors. The upper part\
    \ of the image\n(darker soil color) corresponds to the most drained part of the\
    \ ﬁeld during the winter season, which\nwas then excluded from measurements. Results\
    \ of the experiment are published by Alvino et al. [83],\nreporting the effect\

    \ weight. The small systems were deﬁned\nas an UAV of a maximum weight of 25 kg.\
    \ Watts et al. [87], Matese et al. [51], DeBell et al. [88],\nCandiago et al.\
    \ [89], and Toth and Jó´zków [34] describe current UAS systems (ﬁxed and rotating\
    \ wing),\nsolutions and applications. The following description provides only\
    \ the basics for the UAV remote\nsensing ﬁeld; an extended recent review (monograph)\
    \ on the topic can be found in Pajeres [90], as well\nas in Toth and Jó´zków [34].\n\
    Large volumes of UAVs are expected to ﬂy in upcoming years, so safe operation\
    \ is essential for\nthe user and the public. There are extremely large numbers\
    \ of UAV applications to remote sensing [34].\nColomina and Molina [91] reported\
    \ the evolution of the use of UAVs in the ﬁeld of photogrammetry\nand remote sensing.\n\
    Another state-of-the-art example is available in Sankaran et al. [92], who studied\
    \ the use of UAV\ntechnology for various crop applications (crop emergence, vigor,\
    \ characterization of yield potential).\nThe review also reported the potential\
    \ and future perspectives of using UAV imaging to evaluate the\neffect of biotic\
    \ and abiotic stresses for crop breeding and precision crop yield management.\n\
    DeBell et al. [88] suggested that UAVs are set to become a crucial factor of a\
    \ water-resource\nmanagement toolkit. They can ensure high-resolution data (not\
    \ available from other platforms such as\nsatellites or aircrafts), in a cost-effective\
    \ way and in a more sustainable way for water-resource\ntargets.\nThe authors\
    \ suggest the use of UAVs for data analysis of water resource information\n(e.g.,\
    \ regular surveys of reservoir resources, soil moisture assessments by thermal\
    \ imaging, more\neffective consumption).\nAn interesting point of view was reported\
    \ by Anderson [53], who put an emphasis on remote and\nproximal sensing changes\
    \ due to a variety of sensors ﬁtted to drones and kites to improve ﬁne-grained\n\
    understanding of environmental processes. Anderson et al. [93] also proposed a\
    \ grassroots remote\nsensing and democratic mapping for delivering rapid spatial\
    \ data (GeoTIFF images) from lightweight\ndrones and kites with open-source geospatial\
    \ toolkits and android smartphone apps.\nUAVs offer many advantages with respect\
    \ to other platforms, the main one relying on readiness\nand repeatability of\
    \ the measurements. The UAV operator can monitor the procedure and decide\nto\
    \ repeat the ﬂight if something went wrong. Conversely, each satellite has a speciﬁc\
    \ revisit time\n(see Table 1), and it is almost impossible to replicate a survey.\
    \ The airborne ﬂights try to reduce costs\nby bringing together several targets\
    \ and actions (e.g., one strip on different subjects or many strips on\nthe same\
    \ one). This prevents modiﬁcation of the ﬂight plan. The operation costs are the\
    \ lowest for\nthe UAVs, which are ﬂexible and may change sensors/missions/objectives\
    \ easily. However, satellite\nsensors cannot be replaced when they are obsolete\
    \ or out of service.\n3.2.4. Ground-Based Platforms\nThe more common ground-based\
    \ platforms (up to 50 m) are tripods, towers, poles, and cranes,\nas well as instruments\
    \ mounted on vehicles. They are characterized by different land coverage:\nshort\
    \ (50–100 m), medium (150–250 m), and long (up to 1 km).\nPlatforms may be temporary\n\
    or permanent and are usually used to support research projects, even for micro-meteorological\n\
    measurements like, for example, for Bowen-ratio and Eddy-covariance [94].\nImportant\
    \ data can be also collected in the ﬁeld using vehicle-mounted instruments.\n\
    O’Shaughnessy et al. [95] have studied how to enhance crop-water-use efﬁciency\
    \ by reducing\nirrigation losses and enhancing soil water availability. The authors\
    \ underline that abiotic and biotic\nfactors can increase the yield gap through\
    \ a reduction of water use and of crop yield potential.\nEmerging technologies,\
    \ such as wireless communication, may be integrated with soil and plant sensors\n\
    (variable-rate irrigation equipment, and decision support systems).\nHorticulturae\
    \ 2017, 3, 40\n10 of 36\nAqeel-ur-Rehman et al. [96] discussed different examples\
    \ of the use of sensors and their networks\nfor agriculture and irrigation purposes.\
    \ Damas et al. [97] developed an automatic irrigation system\nwith signiﬁcant\
    \ water conservation (i.e., up to 30–60%). Evans and Bergman [98] worked on precision\n\
    irrigation control of self-propelled, linear-movement and center-pivot irrigation\
    \ systems, controlled by\nwireless technology. To improve water use efﬁciency,\
    \ Morais et al. [99] implemented a smart irrigated\nsystem piloted by a wireless\
    \ data acquisition network to acquire environmental (climate) and soil\nmoisture\
    \ data. Basu et al. [100] set a drip-irrigation-control system characterized by\
    \ remote sensing\ndata acquisition. Kim et al. [101] devised a site-speciﬁc sprinkler\
    \ irrigation system equipped with a\nreal time sensor (using Bluetooth and GPS\
    \ technologies) and control software based on soil moisture,\ntemperature and\
    \ weather information data. Kim and Evans [102] and Evans et al. [103] improved\n\
    the above noted irrigation system with “in-ﬁeld data feedback to support the decision-making\
    \ and real-time\nmonitoring of irrigation operations via Bluetooth wireless radio\
    \ communication”. Thompson et al. [104]\nstudied soil moisture sensors to support\
    \ the decision-making irrigation management scheduling.\nThe study was aimed at\
    \ determining threshold values of soil water characteristics (matric potential\n\
    and available soil water content), using appropriate values of leaf water potential\
    \ for pepper, melon,\nspring tomato and winter tomato crops.\n4. Approaches to\
    \ Precision Irrigation\nRemote sensing has many potential applications in many\
    \ ﬁelds and at different scales. Table 2\nlists ﬁeld applications of remote sensing\
    \ in agriculture. Moran et al. [28] summarized the important\nrole of remote sensing\
    \ in site-speciﬁc farming.\nRemote Sensing can provide non-destructive, automatic,\
    \ and continuous measurements, easily\nimplemented with data transmission systems\
    \ for the user to have nearly real time access to the\ncollected data from a remote\
    \ computer, smart phone or similar [30].\nMost of these methods\nand related systems\
    \ are highly sensitive and capable of working under ﬁeld conditions for long\n\
    periods. These characteristics confer great potential for both monitoring water\
    \ stress and scheduling\nirrigation [105].\nTable 2. Applications of remote sensing\

    \ resources\nRemote sensing can provide precise information of irrigated crop\
    \ areas [106] by monitoring the\nphenological development of crops through multi-temporal\
    \ image [107].\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n11 of 36\nCrop water status is the\
    \ crucial biophysical property, used in particular to manage irrigation\nby remote\
    \ sensing. It is, in most cases, directly associated to the available soil water\
    \ content, and in\nother conditions to soil salt content when salinity is a limiting\
    \ factor of water uptake. Similarly, plant\ndiseases, which may be obstacles to\
    \ plant-water ﬂow, may negatively inﬂuence crop water status,\nwhich becomes an\
    \ indicator of disease presence and severity [108,109]. Crop water status can\
    \ be\nquantiﬁed at the canopy and leaf levels, by monitoring leaf or stem water\
    \ potential, or leaf water\ncontent [110]. Unfortunately, this simplistic view\
    \ is complicated by several plant factors (root signaling,\naerodynamic characteristics\
    \ of vegetation, genetic control of crop performance, etc.), which interact\n\
    in a complicated way with environmental factors, such as solar radiation (intensity\
    \ and insulation),\nwind speed and direction, air humidity, and air temperature.\
    \ Plant species may or may not be highly\ncoupled to the environment [111]. The\
    \ Ω coefﬁcient (or decoupling coefﬁcient) is a measure of the\ncoupling between\
    \ conditions at the canopy surface and in the free airstream (well above the crop),\
    \ and\ncan vary between 0 (for perfect coupling) to 1 (for complete isolation).\
    \ Jones [111] reports Ω values of\n0.85, 0.7, 0.4, 0.3 for strawberry, tomato,\
    \ raspberry, and citrus orchards, respectively. In other words, a\ncitrus orchard\
    \ is more coupled to the environment than more dense horticultural crops. The\
    \ concept is\nsummarized by Hsiao [112], who stated that relatively open, tall\
    \ and aerodynamically rough canopies\nmade of small leaves facilitate turbulence\
    \ and air movement within the canopy, and therefore, are\nclosely coupled to the\
    \ air overhead. Conifer forests show a low decoupling factor Ω. In contrast, dense,\n\
    smooth and short canopies, with all the leaves packed into the limited vertical\
    \ space, would obstruct air\nmovement and therefore are nearly uncoupled from\
    \ the air overhead. For many ﬁeld and horticultural\ncrops with short and dense\
    \ canopies, control of transpiration may be expected to be minimal until\nstomata\
    \ close, and canopy conductance decreases markedly. Another crucial point is the\
    \ ability of\nsome crops to limit their leaf water potential, preventing it from\
    \ falling below a critical level (isohydric\nbehavior). Marino et al. [113] have\
    \ reported that daytime leaf water status (or water potential) was\nmaintained\
    \ relatively constant as long as the potential transpiration exceeded the hydraulic\
    \ threshold.\nThis means that water potential of the leaves remained relatively\
    \ constant during the day and during\nperiods of minor-to-moderate water stress\
    \ events, regardless of soil water status, because of active\nstomatal control.\
    \ The assessment of the isohydric crop response is important for crop-water-use\n\
    predictions and requirements, and photosynthetic productivity under uneven irrigation\
    \ conditions.\nIn contrast, many species show unisohydric behavior with leaf water\
    \ potential relatively coupled\nto the environment. The different behavior of\
    \ isohydric and unisohydric plants may affect Remote\nSensing measurements based\
    \ on thermography. Two crops, one isohydric and the other unisohydric,\nboth held\
    \ in non-limiting soil water conditions, would be expected to return different\
    \ values of Crop\nWater Stress Index (CWSI). Since both crops are well-watered,\
    \ the differing behaviors of isohydric and\nunisohydric crops may affect irrigation\
    \ scheduling if appropriate corrections are not applied to each\nspecies (e.g.,\
    \ by using different thermal index threshold values).\nAccording to Casa et al\
    \ [114], several methodologies are available for estimating crop water use\nand\
    \ water use efﬁciency. Evett [115] developed a theoretical approach to precision\
    \ irrigation based on\nremote sensing, considered a powerful, practical and cost-effective\
    \ tool for obtaining comparable yield,\ncrop quality, and water and nutrient use\
    \ efﬁciencies proﬁtably and sustainably. In the ﬁeld of irrigation,\nﬁve major\
    \ approaches to irrigation management using remote sensing were reported (Table\
    \ 3).\nThe ﬁve approaches can be grouped into three major categories related to\
    \ ET estimation (point 1\nand 4); infrared thermography (point 2 and 3) and crop\
    \ characteristics (point 5). Many papers report\n“new methods” to calculate precision\
    \ irrigation based on remote sensing, combining, simplifying or\nintegrating the\
    \ methods described above.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n12 of 36\nTable 3. Five\
    \ major approaches to irrigation management using remote sensing. From Evett [115].\n\
    1\nScheduling irrigation to replace ET estimated from a reference ET (ETo), calculated\
    \ from local weather data,\nwhich is multiplied by a crop coefﬁcient estimated\
    \ with a crop coefﬁcient function, Kc (NDVI), where NDVI is\nthe normalized difference\
    \ vegetative index (NDVI) or a similar index adjusted for reﬂectance from soil.\n\
    The NDVI is based on canopy irradiance in the red and near-infrared bands, which\
    \ can be remotely sensed.\n2\nScheduling irrigation at a ﬁxed amount of water\
    \ whenever a trigger to irrigate is generated by the crop water\nstress index\
    \ (CWSI), which is estimated using remotely sensed surface temperature (Ts) and\
    \ local weather data.\n3\nScheduling irrigation at a ﬁxed amount when triggered\
    \ by the time-temperature threshold index (TTTI) reaching\na crop and region-speciﬁc\
    \ value. The TTTI is calculated using Ts.\n4\nScheduling irrigation to replace\

    through control of an integrated irrigation application system.\n4.1. ET Estimation\n\
    Satellite Remote Sensing retrieval of evapotranspiration has become a popular\
    \ tool and a focus of\nstudy in the past two to three decades. High-resolution\
    \ daily evapotranspiration (ET) maps would\ngreatly improve irrigation crop management\
    \ [116]. Remote Sensing based ET estimation roughly\nstarted in the 1980s and\
    \ has evolved into a variety of approaches and models as reported in an\nexhaustive\
    \ paper by Zhang et al. [117]. In addition, Liou and Kar [118] reported the estimation\
    \ of ET\nwith RS and various surface-energy-balance algorithms (SEBAL). The authors\
    \ reviewed these different\nsatellites based approaches and the main physical\
    \ bases and assumptions of these algorithms.\nIt is difﬁcult to categorize these\
    \ methods, since they try to compensate for the empirical modules\nand physically\
    \ based modules used. Table 4 lists a classiﬁcation by Courault et al. [119]\n\
    Table 4. Evapotranspiration (ET) estimation model categories. From Courault et\
    \ al. [119]\n1\nEmpirically direct methods (remote sensing data are introduced\
    \ directly in semi-empirical models to estimate ET)\n2\nResidual methods of the\
    \ energy budget (combining some empirical relationships and physical modules in\n\
    models such as SEBAL)\n3\nDeterministic methods (more complex models such as Soil–Vegetation–Atmosphere\
    \ Transfer models (SVAT),\nwhich compute the different components of energy budget\
    \ (ISBA, Meso-NH)\n4\nVegetation-index methods (remote sensing to compute Kc or\
    \ Priestley Taylor-alpha parameters).\nRemote sensing techniques for estimating\
    \ ET from satellites [120] have been developed from\nenergy balances, thus generating\
    \ estimates of actual evapotranspiration [121,122]. The University\nof Idaho (USA)\
    \ has developed a model to estimate ET called Mapping Evapo Transpiration\nwith\
    \ high Resolution and Internalized Calibration (METRIC) [122], based on the Surface\
    \ Energy\nBalance Algorithms from the Land (SEBAL) model of Bastiaanssen et al.\
    \ [121]. In METRIC, the\nevapotranspiration is calculated from Landsat imagery\
    \ calculating the available energy using the\nearth surface temperature (Ts) derived\
    \ from satellite imagery thermal bands, to constrain the heat\nﬂux for one or\
    \ more layers (canopy and soil), and then computing the latent heat as a residual\
    \ to the\nsurface energy balance [123]. In other words, the energy utilized by\
    \ the ET process is considered as a\nresidual of the SEBAL equation. The ratio\
    \ between actual evapotranspiration (Etcrop) and reference\nevapotranspiration\
    \ (Eto) can be calculated only when ET is measured; this ratio is the Kcact, namely\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n13 of 36\nthe actual crop coefﬁcient [124]. Allen et\
    \ al. [122] reported this method (Crop ET estimations based on\nKcact) is a useful\
    \ tool for ﬁeld and regional water management.\nThe energy-balance approach has\
    \ the beneﬁt that it can be utilized to quantify the dimensions\nof irrigated\
    \ ﬁelds and their water-use dynamics, without reference to source of water as\
    \ opposed to\na water balance model. This latter model necessitates the information\
    \ of both the magnitude and\ntemporal distribution of rainfall and irrigation\
    \ applied to ﬁelds [125]. Temperature-based methods, as\nSEBAL, can be automated\
    \ and likely outperform vegetation-based methods in irrigated areas, especially\n\
    under conditions of low vegetation cover and high soil evaporation. According\
    \ to Biggs et al. [126],\nan automated SEBAL can estimate the evaporative fraction\
    \ from irrigated crops with a mean error of\n14% of Rn (range 218% to 124%). Allen\
    \ et al. [127] conﬁrmed the maturing technology of SEBAL and\nMETRIC for deriving\
    \ a satellite-driven surface energy balance for estimating ET from the ground’s\n\
    surface. The authors foresee a great future for these models in the scientiﬁc\
    \ groups dealing with\nwater resources.\nSantos et al. [120] have combined METRIC-derived\
    \ estimates of ET with a water balance model\nnamed LORMOD [128] to evaluate,\
    \ at a plot level, the use of near-real time ET estimates to update\nand correct\
    \ irrigation scheduling predictions and to assess its impact on WUE. ET estimates\
    \ derived\nfrom satellites were used in a daily soil-water-balance model to improve\
    \ accuracy of ﬁeld-by-ﬁeld ET\ndemands and, as a consequence, ﬁeld-scale irrigation\
    \ schedules. This approach combined high spatial\nresolution (satellite RS) data\
    \ with high temporal resolution data (daily soil-water-balance), providing\nsigniﬁcant\
    \ advances in irrigation schedules, as reported for cotton (a 24% reduction) increasing\
    \ ﬁeld\nirrigation efﬁciency to 0.72; the ﬁeld irrigation efﬁciency reached 0.90\
    \ for sugar beet [120].\nTrezza et al. [129] reported an estimation of actual\
    \ ET for central New Mexico. They matched ET\nimages derived from MODIS with those\
    \ taken by Landsat. The adoption of a METRIC model based on\nMODIS imageries produced\
    \ monthly and annual ET estimates, comparable to those obtained with\nLandsat\
    \ imagery.\nElhaddad and Garcia [130] reported a ReSET model based on wind from\
    \ multiple weather stations\nand the use of a weather station for the model calibration.\
    \ This ﬂexible approach generated raster\ninterpolated weather parameters, accounting\
    \ for spatial variation of weather parameters between\nweather stations, which\
    \ can be signiﬁcant. They found that ET calculated using this approach could\n\
    vary by 17% compared with ET calculated with point values.\nSubsequently, Elhaddad\
    \ and Garcia [131] assessed the use of actual ET calculated by ReSET to\nestimate\
    \ seasonal crop water use at regional scale instead of the traditional ET estimation\
    \ method\nbased on reference ET and crop coefﬁcients.\nOrtega-Farías et al. [132]\
    \ estimated the energy balance components over a drip-irrigated olive\norchard,\
    \ using thermal and multispectral cameras placed on a helicopter-based unmanned\
    \ aerial\nvehicle, acquiring high-resolution images to assess intra-ﬁeld spatial\
    \ variability.\nIn the ﬁeld of irrigation scheduling/WUE, there are very few concrete\
    \ outcomes. In particular,\nD’Urso et al. [133] analyzed, from the PLEIADeS framework,\
    \ ﬁve agricultural systems, in a broad\nrange of arid and semi-arid conditions\
    \ characteristic for the European, Southern Mediterranean, and\nAmerican regions.\
    \ The aim of the project was to improve the efﬁciency of the irrigation schemes,\
    \ made\npossible through wide space–time coverage of Earth Observation data and\
    \ interactive networking\ncapabilities of Information and Communication Technologies.\
    \ They included the following: canopy\nparameters, fractional vegetation cover,\
    \ LAI, albedo, crop coefﬁcients, potential ET, irrigation water\nrequirements.\
    \ They conﬁrmed the possibility of estimating crop coefﬁcient from NDVI, relying\
    \ upon\nadvances in spatial and radiometric accuracy of new sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2),\
    \ for a full exploitation of\ntheir applications.\nPeña-Arancibia et al. [107]\
    \ quantiﬁed irrigation water use and water provenance (surface water\nor groundwater),\
    \ combining t remote sensing data on irrigation dynamics and actual ET linked\
    \ with\na river-reach hydrological model. They concluded that the results were\
    \ as accurate as those of more\ntraditional irrigation area modelling using remotely\
    \ sensed irrigated areas. Actual ET data can be used\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n\
    14 of 36\nto understand irrigation dynamics, the constraints in irrigation models,\
    \ and speciﬁc areas that require\nbetter monitoring.\nVanino et al. [134] estimated\
    \ the ET and crop coefﬁcients of table grape vineyards trained on\noverhead “tendone”\
    \ systems in the Apulia region (Italy). The FAO direct methodology for estimating\n\
    potential evapotranspiration (ETp) was used to estimate maximum vineyard transpiration.\
    \ The model,\nbased on existing validated methodologies, used appropriate values\
    \ of canopy variables (albedo and\nthe LAI) derived by means of multispectral\
    \ satellite data. ETp values (mean seasonal daily ET) ranged\nbetween 4.2 and\
    \ 4.1 mm·d−1, and from 0.88 to 0.93 in 2013 and 1.02 to 1.04 in 2014 for the midseason\n\
    values, respectively. The results indicated that the values of Kc are site- and\
    \ year-speciﬁc and depend\non local ET0 rates, rainfall frequency, cumulative\
    \ thermal requirements, and effective canopy cover.\nThe resulting crop water\
    \ requirements were lower than the actual average irrigation volumes applied\n\
    by farmers, thus suggesting the possibility of improving the water use efﬁciency\
    \ of these crops by\nadopting the proposed methodology. We agree with the authors\
    \ that, in the Mediterranean, few studies\nhave investigated the satellite Kc\
    \ estimation for vineyards.\nLópez-López et al. [135] estimated ET starting from\
    \ ﬁeld weather data and Kc estimated with a\nfunction related to vegetation indices\
    \ such as NDVI or index adjusted for reﬂectance from soil.\nKamble et al. [136]\
    \ studied how to estimate Kc directly from reﬂectance and VIs derived from\na\
    \ satellite. The authors found that NDVI-Kc quantiﬁed from remote sensing could\
    \ be useful for\nestimating WUE, irrigation scheduling and performance, and agricultural\
    \ water budgets. The NDVI-Kc\nmay be also utilized for agriculture water conservation,\
    \ starting from local to continental scales.\nRecently, Battista et al. [137]\
    \ published a paper with the aim of demonstrating how spatialized\nmeteorological\
    \ data and remote sensing techniques may allow one to estimate actual ET and the\
    \ soil\nwater content of a small plot (about 0.1 ha) of an olive orchard. As a\
    \ rule, for Mediterranean areas,\ntrees were covered by several herbaceous species.\
    \ The authors found that the NDVI-Cws (coefﬁcient of\nwater stress) method is\
    \ a suitable tool for estimating daily olive tree actual transpiration and soil\
    \ water\ncontent in complex and multi-layer Mediterranean agricultural ecosystems.\
    \ The novelty of the adopted\nmethod was to consider the spatially fragmented,\
    \ two-layer structure of an olive orchard. For instance,\nthe ETa of trees and\
    \ grasses were combined with weather data (precipitation) to assess the site-speciﬁc\n\
    water balance, which was assessed through comparison with daily measurements of\
    \ soil water content.\nMoreover, this highlighted the importance of separating\
    \ trees and grasses for estimation of the NDVI,\nadopting statistical operations\
    \ to satellite imagery with different spatio-temporal properties.\nMarshall et\
    \ al. [138], with the aim of partitioning ET into soil evaporation and crop transpiration,\n\
    studied the ratio-based vegetation indices (NDVI, SAVI, EVI) retrieved from optical\
    \ remote sensing,\nhighlighting their limitations and how VIs can induce large\
    \ model error. NDVI explained half of the\nvariability in transpiration, the largest\
    \ component of ET. However, to estimate total ET one should\nconsider the Photochemical\
    \ Reﬂectance Index (PRI). To estimate soil evaporation, the authors suggest\n\
    two new ratio-based indices derived from NIR bands 743 and 953 nm and visible\
    \ blue 428 nm and\nfrom SWIR1 bands 1518 nm.\nGonzález-Dugo and Mateos [139] used\
    \ an approach based on the conjecture that variations in\nthe size of the crop\
    \ have much stronger effects on its ET than variations in stomatal conductance.\n\
    This assumption seems to be valid for irrigated crops, according to several studies\
    \ [140–142]. The results\nshowed the potential of this method for ﬁeld application.\
    \ Since there is little agreement on the nature\nof the relationships between\
    \ VIs and Kc, the latter can be estimated from spectral measurements.\nThe rationale\
    \ is that both the component of the crop coefﬁcient that represents transpiration\
    \ (Kcb)\nand VIs are sensitive to crop biomass (LAI and ground cover fraction—fc).\
    \ The relationships between\nKcb and VIs could be linear or non-linear. The linearity\
    \ of these relationships depends on the crop\narchitecture [143]. Er-Raki et al.\
    \ [142] used the same approach to derive Kcb values of wheat crops,\nanalyzing\
    \ the relationships between VIs, and both LAI and fc.\nThe use of remotely-sensed-vegetation\
    \ indices has been tested to predict crop coefﬁcients at\ndifferent scales. In\
    \ fact, González-Dugo and Mateos [139] found that the NDVI and SAVI were strictly\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n15 of 36\nrelated to LAI, vegetation ground cover and\
    \ biomass. These relationships were obtained by radiometric\nmeasurements obtained\
    \ from satellite and ground-based platforms. The relationship is simple and\n\
    robust and may be used for studying WUE and water productivity at a regional level.\n\
    The statistical analyses of ﬁeld data and remote sensing data, derived from multispectral\
    \ imagery\nusing an UAV, conﬁrms the feasibility of applying the proposed methods\
    \ to assess physiological and\nstructural properties of Citrus under water and\
    \ saline stress. The novelty of this study was to show\nthat diurnal changes in\
    \ physiological and structural traits of citrus irrigated with RW combined with\n\
    RDI could be determined by multispectral images from UAVs. NIR was a useful indicator\
    \ of s, A and\ngs on both crops. The NDVI was strictly related to gas exchange\
    \ in both species and on mandarin [144].\nZarco-Tejada et al. [145] hypothesized\
    \ that the index PRI (normalized by canopy chlorophyll\ncontent), might be a strong\
    \ indicator of the diurnal dynamics of water stress.\nThey acquired\nnarrow-band\
    \ multispectral and thermal imageries over a vineyard cultivated under three different\n\
    irrigation treatments, and evaluated the relationships between the normalized\
    \ PRI, ﬁeld-physiological\nparameters (stomatal conductance) and plant water potential.\
    \ Relationships with CWSI, which were\nused as a remote sensing benchmark for\
    \ water stress detection, were also discussed by the authors,\nwho reasoned that\
    \ CWSI can be used as a remote sensing benchmark for water stress detection. Some\n\
    critical points were suggested for integrating VIs derived by UAVs and everyday\
    \ water resource\nmanagement, such as the integration of differential global positioning\
    \ and the development of\nintelligent control of UAV platforms to improve positional\
    \ accuracy and spatial data capture.\nA review by Kang et al. [146] set up the\
    \ ﬁrst worldwide dataset to analyze the global LAI-VI\nrelationships at different\
    \ spatial and temporal scales. Analysis was derived from low-resolution (30 m)\n\
    satellite Landsat images, with the goal of producing large-scale ﬁne resolution\
    \ LAI maps, essential\nfor agricultural applications, especially in mosaic agriculture.\
    \ The authors reported that the LAI-VI\nrelationships were crop-speciﬁc and may\
    \ explain why the largest amount of variance in ﬁeld-measured\nLAI was obtained\
    \ using only remotely sensed observations.\n4.2. Infrared Thermography\n4.2.1.\
    \ CWSI\nScientists tried to ﬁnd indexes that describe the relationship between\
    \ and thermal characteristics\nof plants and water stress [147]. Jackson et al.\
    \ [148] set up the CWSI, Jackson [149] the Surface\nTemperature (ST), Moran et\
    \ al. [150] the Water Deﬁcit Index (WDI), Vidal et al. [151] the Stress Index\n\
    (SI), and Guilioni et al. [152] the Stomatal conductance index. Plants showing\
    \ symptoms of wilting emit\nmore longwave infrared radiation, revealing canopy\
    \ temperature. Unfortunately, canopy temperature\nis affected by meteorological\
    \ conditions at the time of measurement, so it cannot be an absolute\nindicator\
    \ of water stress.\nWe recommend several papers related to theoretical approaches\
    \ dealing with infrared\nthermography: Jones and Vaughan [40] provided a rigorous\
    \ and detailed explanation of the theory\nand practical applications of remote\
    \ sensing; Maes and Steppe [153] wrote an exhaustive review\non thermal remote\
    \ sensing technique and ﬁeld variation of plants and environmental parameters\n\
    involved. Other key papers include those from Mulla [94], Gago et al. [154], Thenkabail\
    \ et al. [155],\nand Jones [156].\nAmong the indexes cited above, the most studied\
    \ is the CWSI, which was developed at the U.S.\nWater Conservation Laboratory\
    \ in the 1970s and 1980s [148,157,158] and has been commercialized and\nwidely\
    \ used in irrigation management. Jackson et al. [148] found that CWSI was deﬁned\
    \ by the ratio of\nactual to potential ET calculated from the Penman-Monteith\
    \ equation, and highlighted the usefulness\nand limitation of the index. Although\
    \ it appeared to be a promising tool for quantifying crop water\nstress, it was\
    \ unable to quantify crop water needs, or the time threshold for watering a crop.\n\
    A long list of indices is available at the website IDB (http://www.indexdatabase.de/db/i.\n\
    php?offset=1), which reports the basic information for each index including the\
    \ following: name,\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n16 of 36\nabbreviation, formula,\
    \ variables, explanations of variables, wavelengths, source, description; sensors,\n\
    visualization of required spectral range; visualization of Sensor-Bands, applications,\
    \ references.\nGiven deﬁned environmental conditions (air humidity, air temperature),\
    \ the CWSI index is based\non the quantiﬁcation of the behaviour of a crop both\
    \ when it is fully transpiring and when it is not.\nLópez-López et al. [135] expressed\
    \ CWSI in terms of evapotranspiration:\nCWSI = 1 − ETc/ET0\nwhere, ETc is the\
    \ actual crop evapotranspiration and ET0 is the reference evapotranspiration.\n\
    According to López-López [135], the relation between ETc and ET0 approaches the\
    \ theoretical values\nproposed by Jackson [148], because it is decoupled from\
    \ the wind velocity as in the classical form,\naccording to Idso et al. [158].\n\
    Idso [159] suggested replacing the estimations of VPD from minimum temperature\
    \ with air\ntemperature measurements in direct radiation on irrigated plots, with\
    \ the goal of increasing and partly\ncorrecting the inﬂuence of the superﬁcial\
    \ soil temperature on LAI. The accurate assessment of the ET\nby means of the\
    \ CWSI is assumed by the relation between ETc and the leaf’s water potential (ET0)\
    \ at\ndawn, according to Itier et al. [160].\nEvett [115] deﬁned the CWSI as:\n\
    CWSI = ((Tc − Ta)m − (Tc − Ta)l)/((Tc − Ta)u − (Tc − Ta)l)\nIt uses the crop canopy\
    \ temperature (measured by an IR thermometer or thermal images) and\nenvironmental\
    \ parameters (air temperature, air humidity, wind speed, solar radiation). The\
    \ canopy-air\ntemperature difference (Tc − Ta) is normalized to the lower and\
    \ upper limits of canopy-air temperature\ndifferences, which represent non-water-stressed\
    \ and completely water-stressed crops, respectively.\nThe subscript “m” denotes\
    \ measured data, while “l” denotes a lower baseline (non-water-stressed\ncrop),\
    \ “u” denotes an upper limit (completely water stressed crop), which is an estimated\
    \ parameter.\nThe (Tc − Ta)l and (Tc − Ta)u limits may be estimated either on\
    \ an empirical or theoretical basis as\ndescribed by Idso et al. [158] and Jackson\
    \ et al. [148]. Both approaches require readings of air humidity\nand air temperature\
    \ but it works better with wind speed and solar radiation data, and estimates\
    \ of\nbulk canopy resistances.\nIrrigation scheduling based on (Tc − Ta) has often\
    \ been determined by the stress degree day\nmethod (SDD), originally suggested\
    \ by Idso et al. [157] and Jackson [161]:\nSDD =\nn\n∑\ni=l\n(Tc − Ta)i\nwith\
    \ Tc and Ta measured 1–1.5 h after solar noon at day i, during a n-day period.\
    \ Irrigation was\ninitiated as soon as SDD exceeded 0. The formula was used successfully\
    \ for different crops [162], and\naccording to Maes and Steppe [153] SDD worked\
    \ well for wheat, and in semi-arid climates where\nweather conditions were expected\
    \ to differ little between consecutive days.\nAccording to King and Shellie [163],\
    \ the CWSI is also deﬁned as:\nCWSI = (Tcanopy − Tnws)/(Tdry − Tnws)\nwhere Tcanopy\
    \ is the temperature of fully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C), Tnws is the temperature\
    \ of\nfully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C) when the crop is non-water-stressed (well-watered)\
    \ and Tdry is the\ntemperature of fully sunlit canopy leaves (◦C) when the crop\
    \ is severely water stressed due to low soil\nwater availability. Temperatures\
    \ Tnws and Tdry are the lower and upper baselines used to normalize\nCWSI for\
    \ the effects of environmental conditions (air temperature, relative humidity,\
    \ radiation, wind\nspeed, etc.) on Tcanopy. Maes and Steppe [153] emphasized the\
    \ limited application of the CWSI by the\ndifﬁculty of estimating without actually\
    \ measuring Tnws and Tdry.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n17 of 36\nJones [164] proposed\
    \ a stress index (SICWSI) analogous to the Idso-Jackson CWSI, using wet\nsurface\
    \ conductance rather than the ﬁnite value for a well-watered crop.\nSIcwsi = (Tleaf\
    \ − Twet)/(Tdry − Twet)\nRojo et al. [165] suggested a modiﬁed CWSI (MCWSI) in\
    \ grape and almond using the\ncontinuous leaf monitor data, where the well-watered\
    \ and dry conditions were measured using\na well-watered tree and a simulated\
    \ dry leaf. The CWSI and MCWSI indices were calculated and\nwere capable of representing\
    \ the stress level of the grape and almond crops, so variable rate irrigation\n\
    was implemented.\nThe CWSI is considered a sensitive tool for monitoring and assessing\
    \ plant water stress for a\nwide range of crops. CWSI was inversely correlated\
    \ to cotton yields [166], and positively correlated\nwith soil water depletion\
    \ for a fully developed canopy when no soil reﬂectance was present [167].\nThe\
    \ CWSI was also able to foresee a yield of several crops under stress and to develop\
    \ schemes for\nmanaging irrigation [168,169]. Furthermore, the Water Deﬁcit Index,\
    \ which is a two-dimensional CWSI\nnormalized for vegetation cover, was related\
    \ to crop water stress [150,170].\nOrta et al. [171] studied the upper and lower\
    \ baselines, and CWSI values on watermelon were\nslightly different. They tested\
    \ CWSI for scheduling irrigation for watermelon grown with ﬁve irrigation\ntreatments\
    \ (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) in terms of the replenishment of the water depletion\
    \ (0.90 m\nsoil proﬁle depth). The CWSI was calculated from IR canopy temperatures,\
    \ air temperatures, and\nvapor pressure deﬁcit values. In two years, the fully\
    \ irrigated treatment gave the highest yield and\nwater use. The CWSI values tended\
    \ to be consistent with the soil water content. The authors proposed\na linear\
    \ equation of CWSI versus yield prediction, and suggested testing in long-term\
    \ experiments a\ncritical value of CWSI at which a farmer should irrigate.\nRecently,\
    \ Bellvert et al. [172] measured the CWSI in three peach cultivars (Prunus persica\
    \ L.)\nthroughout different growing seasons. They measured the canopy temperature\
    \ of well-watered trees\nusing high-resolution thermal imagery obtained from an\
    \ airborne platform and related it to leaf water\npotential (ψL) as a water stress\
    \ indicator. Results demonstrated that (i) the CWSI had similar seasonal\nresponses\
    \ and (ii) a common “non-water-stressed baseline” can be used during the course\
    \ of the entire\ncrop season. The CWSI is a practical method for evaluating the\
    \ spatial variability of peach tree water\nstatus in heterogeneous orchards, and\
    \ for deriving ψL maps throughout a complete growing season.\nSantesteban et al.\
    \ [173] evaluated the ability of high-resolution UAV-based thermal imaging\nto\
    \ estimate instantaneous and seasonal variability of plant water status within\
    \ a vineyard.\nCWSI correlated well with ψs and gs at the moment of image acquisition,\
    \ showing great potential\nfor monitoring instantaneous variations in water status,\
    \ but it did not provide a good estimation of\nvariations of plant water status\
    \ on a single day. The results added evidence regarding the suitability of\nthis\
    \ approach, and reinforced the potential role UAV thermal imaging may have as\
    \ an instantaneous\nwater-stress mapping tool. Similarly, Baluja et al. [174]\
    \ conducted an airborne study over a vineyard,\nwith the goal of computing image-derived\
    \ spectral and thermal indices, and indicators of water status\nin vines including\
    \ (i) the crop water stress index (CWSI), stomatal conductance index (Ig) [164]\
    \ and\n(ii) a formulation of the stomatal conductance index (I3) [164]. They concluded\
    \ that the relationship\nbetween thermal imagery and derived indices can be considered\
    \ as a short-term response, a kind\nof instantaneous “picture” of the plant water\
    \ status situation, while spectral vegetation indices are\nprobably the result\
    \ of cumulative water deﬁcits.\nBerni et al. [84] validated a methodology for\
    \ producing high-resolution maps of canopy\nconductance and CWSI, potentially\
    \ useful for calculating actual ET and as an input for scheduling\nirrigation.\
    \ The canopy of conductance and CWSI maps of olive orchards were acquired by airborne\n\
    and UAV platforms for two years with different irrigation treatments.\nTesti et\
    \ al. [175] showed that the CWSI measured in the ﬁrst afternoon hours were a good\
    \ tool\nfor identifying seasonal changes in the water status of a pistachio orchard\
    \ submitted to variable\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n18 of 36\nwater stress by\
    \ regulated deﬁcit irrigation practices. The temperature of pistachio trees showed\
    \ great\nresponsiveness to variations in plant water status.\nLópez-López et al.\
    \ [135] analyzed ET and CWSI in tomato conﬁrming that the use of infrared\nthermometry\
    \ to calculate the CWSI is a reliable technique for scheduling irrigation using\
    \ the\ndetermined upper and lower CWSI baselines in a husk tomato crop. The CWSI\
    \ value increased\nuntil it reached 0.7 in the treatment with severe irrigation\
    \ restrictions (40% ETo).\nGonzález-Dugo et al. [176] used UAV systems to derive\
    \ CWSI from high-resolution thermal\nimagery. They assessed the spatial variability\
    \ of crop water status in a pistachio orchard for precision\nirrigation purposes.\
    \ The authors estimated a possible reduction of irrigation costs moving from\n\
    common irrigation system to a variable rate irrigation system [177].\nGonzález-Dugo\
    \ et al. [178] also used IR imagery taken by UAVs to evaluate the variability\
    \ in the\nwater status of ﬁve fruit tree species. They compared the daily differential\
    \ between Tc − Ta (canopy\nand air temperature) with the tree water status. Since\
    \ the slope of the differential with time was\nhighly correlated with water status,\
    \ the authors proposed the slope as an indicator of the stomatal\nbehavior. An\
    \ empirical approach was used to deﬁne the upper and lower limits of Tc − Ta;\
    \ CWSI\nwas calculated using the temperature data from a 13-h ﬂight. Another important\
    \ contribution of the\npaper was the assessment of variability in the water status\
    \ based on the differences in relative canopy\ntemperatures. The authors concluded\
    \ that their approach (i) was worthwhile for managing precision\nirrigation; (ii)\
    \ could identify water stressed areas; and (iii) could deﬁne threshold CWSI values,\
    \ a great\nhelp for farmers and for irrigation strategies at different phenological\
    \ stages.\nSezen et al. [179] analyzed the CWSI of red pepper irrigated with two\
    \ systems (drip and furrow)\nand with different irrigation regimes. The authors\
    \ concluded that CWSI could measure crop water\nstatus and improve irrigation\
    \ scheduling. For high-quality yields, the authors suggested CSWI values\nof 0.26\
    \ for drip irrigation and 0.38 for furrow irrigation. For both irrigation methods,\
    \ linear relations\nwere found between CWSI and red pepper yield.\nAgam et al.\
    \ [180] tested CWSI for analyzing the changes in water status of olive trees when\n\
    entering into and recovering from stress on a diurnal scale. CWSI was tested in\
    \ an empirical form\nand in two analytical conﬁgurations. The results showed that\
    \ the empirical CWSI was capable even\ngiven its limitations, while the analytical\
    \ forms of CWSI needed enhancement for monitoring the water\nstatus of olive.\
    \ The authors proposed calculating the wet temperature analytically and ﬁxing\
    \ the dry\ntemperature at a level of 5 ◦C higher than the air temperature. Thermal\
    \ imaging and water status\nmeasurements were recorded between 12:00 and 14:00.\n\
    Wang et al. [181] conducted a two-year experiment on early-ripening peach exposed\
    \ to postharvest\ndeﬁcit irrigation schemes, concluding that IR measurements might\
    \ estimate plant water stress,\nparticularly in high-radiative arid and semi-arid\
    \ climates. They found that the temperature differences\n(infrared-canopy temperature\
    \ and air temperature) where correlated to stem water potential and\nproved to\
    \ be a useful tool for water stress assessment for managing regulated deﬁcit irrigation.\n\
    Temperature differences (midday canopy to air temperature) ranged from 5 to 7\
    \ ◦C in the water-stressed\npostharvest deﬁcit irrigation treatments, while they\
    \ ranged from 1.4 to 2 ◦C in the non-water-stressed\ncontrol treatments.\nTaghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] calculated CWSI for four 1-hour periods, ranging from 10:00 to\
    \ 14:00,\neach day for 29 days.\nThe estimated CWSI was smallest from 10:00 to\
    \ 11:00 and largest from\n12:00 to 13:00. These values may be used for precise\
    \ (amounts and timing) irrigation scheduling.\nWhen measurements were taken during\
    \ earlier hours, the authors suggested adopting a conservative\nthreshold value\
    \ of CWSI; in contrast, they suggested higher levels when measurements were recorded\n\
    one hour after solar noon.\nGarcía-Tejero et al. [183] conducted a study using\
    \ thermal data to monitor crop-water status in\nirrigated Mediterranean viticulture.\
    \ They found that CWSI and IG might provide more meaningful\ninformation about\
    \ the crop-water status than Tcanopy-air.\nThe authors also found that TC was\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n19 of 36\nsigniﬁcantly correlated with gs and net assimilation,\
    \ suggesting that it can be used as a simpler\nparameter to support thermal remote\
    \ sensing of water stress in grapevines.\nKullber et al. [184] compared and evaluated\
    \ the accuracy of several water-stress coefﬁcient\nmethods for estimating crop\
    \ ETc under different levels of deﬁcit irrigation. Four canopy temperature\nbased\
    \ methods were used to calculate Ks: CWSI, Canopy Temperature Ratio (Tc ratio),\
    \ Degrees Above\nNon-Stressed Temperature (DANS), Degrees Above Canopy Threshold\
    \ (DACT). Methods using only\ncanopy temperature measurements (DANS, DACT, and\
    \ Tc ratio) performed with comparable error to\nmore data intensive methods such\
    \ as CWSI and demonstrated their potential for irrigation scheduling.\nOsroosh\
    \ et al. [185] carried out an experiment on apple trees, to compare two empirical\
    \ indexes, a\nCWSId (averaged over daylight hours) and a CWSIm (midday CWSI).\
    \ Since CWSI was very sensitive\nto mild variations in the soil water content,\
    \ the authors suggested using CWSId and CWSIm for\nestimating soil water availability.\
    \ These indices were also stable under transitional weather conditions.\nMangus\
    \ et al. [186] considered the time changes of IR for monitoring corn water stress\
    \ at high\nspatial and temporal resolution for managing irrigation water within\
    \ large agricultural production\nsystems. In the 80-day study, they observed a\
    \ statistical decrease in soil moisture “only when the\nCWSI value increased past\
    \ 0.6 with 82% of soil moisture variation explained by the CWSI”. The CWSI\nwas\
    \ negatively correlated to soil moisture, demonstrating the potentiality of CWSI\
    \ (i) as an alternate\nirrigation scheduling method; and (ii) for quantifying\
    \ spatial soil moisture by IR canopy temperatures.\n4.2.2. Time-Temperature Threshold\
    \ (TTT)\nThe TTT is a method based on a canopy temperature threshold and a time\
    \ threshold [187,188].\nBecause it is a response method of automatic control,\
    \ the TTT method does not need supplementary\ninputs for activating irrigation;\
    \ and it has been credited for regulating water-use efﬁciency.\nEvett et al. [188]\
    \ found no statistical differences in yield and WUE, when comparing TTT and with\n\
    manually irrigated plots, in soybean and corn.\nO’Shaughnessy et al. [189] studied\
    \ the relationship between cotton irrigation scheduling, using\nsoil water measurements\
    \ and two thermal indices. An automatic irrigation scheduling determined by\n\
    a TTT algorithm reduced applied water volumes that did not negatively affect yield.\
    \ In well-watered\nconditions (full irrigation), the TTT method increased WUE\
    \ with respect to the water balance method;\ndifferences were not signiﬁcant at\
    \ reduced water depths (rates of 33 and 67% of full irrigation).\nThe authors\
    \ also found similar trends between two thermal indices, although the daily theoretical\n\
    CWSI resulted in over-irrigation when it was over 0.5.\nLamm et al. [190] compared\
    \ the TTT and ET-based irrigation scheduling for corn production.\nThe TTT method\
    \ accumulated time when the crop was above a speciﬁed temperature. An irrigation\n\
    event signal was triggered when the accumulated time exceeded the speciﬁed TTT\
    \ threshold.\nThe authors compared (i) three irrigation treatments with TTT values\
    \ of 2.5 h, 4.0 h or 5.5 h above a\ncanopy temperature of 28 ◦C; and (ii) two\
    \ ETc treatments (100% and 65%), plus a treatment receiving\nno further irrigation\
    \ after mid-July in Kansas. The results indicated that a TTT with a threshold\
    \ of 2.5 h\ncorresponded to a fully irrigated treatment.\nO’Shaughnessy et al.\
    \ [191] developed a method of integrating the CWSI over a day for presenting\n\
    clear CWSI signals occurring in some environmental conditions, near solar noon.\
    \ CWSI-TT was the\naccumulated time when CWSI was greater than a threshold value\
    \ of 0.45; this cumulated time value\nwas compared with a CWSI-TT value obtained\
    \ for a well-watered crop. The use of CWIS-TT, however,\ncan lead to an over-irrigation\
    \ due to false positive triggers that may be generated early in the season.\n\
    CWSI-TT provided yield results similar to scientiﬁc irrigation scheduling using\
    \ a neutron probe.\nOsroosh et al. [192] tested an automatic control system along\
    \ with a wireless network of soil,\nthermal and weather sensors, developed for\
    \ an apple orchard. Seven irrigation-scheduling algorithms\nwere tested: TTT,\
    \ CWSI, soil-based using granular matrix sensors (SOIL), an ET model, a soil water\n\
    balance (WB), a combination of SOIL and WB, a conventional irrigation practice\
    \ used in the region,\nand soil-based using a neutron probe (NP) as benchmark.\
    \ The treatments TTT, CWSI, NP and WB\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n20 of 36\nsubstantially\
    \ reduced water (70%) while maintaining ψstem within the non-stressed range. WB\
    \ seemed\nto demonstrate the characteristics of being economical, easy to implement\
    \ and accurate.\nDeJonge et al. [193] conducted an experiment on corn to evaluate\
    \ several water stress indices based\non canopy temperature. All thermal indices\
    \ responded quickly to irrigation-treatment differences at\nmajor growth stages,\
    \ in particular Degrees Above Non-Stressed index and Degrees Above Canopy\nThreshold\
    \ index were highly correlated with CWSI above the corn threshold of 28 ◦C used\
    \ in the\nTTT method. Furthermore, all indices showed a linear relationship with\
    \ soil water deﬁcit at high\ntemperatures. Degrees Above Canopy Threshold was\
    \ the best index due to (i) the strong relationships\nwith other indices and crop\
    \ water measurements; and (ii) because it was derived from a single canopy\ntemperature\
    \ measurement.\n4.2.3. Thermography Issue and Critical Aspects\nThe infrared thermometry\
    \ measurements suffer from several critical points, which may affect\nnegatively\
    \ the accuracy of the results. Jones et al. [156] found many important deﬁciencies\
    \ in the\ngeneral applications of CWSI. In particular deﬁciencies included (i)\
    \ the absolute temperature ranges\nmay be small in humid environments; (ii) the\
    \ canopy temperature was negatively affected when crop\nsurface target accidentally\
    \ includes areas such as soil, sky, and trunks; (iii) there existed a different\n\
    distribution of temperatures of sunlit and shaded parts of the canopy; and (iv)\
    \ the sunlit part of the\ncanopy showed a wider range of temperatures when viewed\
    \ normal to the rows or down the rows.\nEvett et al. [115] reported some other\
    \ critical points including that (i) the signal was not stable\nduring cloudy\
    \ periods; (ii) the lower base line and upper limit were difﬁculty to determine\
    \ and (iii)\nno uniqueness of these limits. Others problems were related to the\
    \ ﬁrst growth stages, when soil\nbackground was visible and it was more difﬁcult\
    \ to measure the canopy temperature.\nBaselines\nThe theoretical deﬁnition of\
    \ the two baselines, the lower baseline (well-watered crop, or more\nprecisely\
    \ non-water-stressed crop), and the upper baseline (completely water stressed\
    \ crop).\nThe lower baseline (non-water-stressed crop) depends on the plant species,\
    \ and even among\nvarieties of the same species, which have different canopy and\
    \ leaf structures. The energy balance of\ncrops may differ consistently, since\
    \ each canopy structure has its own radiometric properties, which\ncan facilitate\
    \ in some cases eradiation capture, and, in other cases, that which can escape\
    \ excessive\nradiation loads.\nLeaf Temperature Variability\nOptical parameters\
    \ of leaves of 30 plant species were presented by Gausman and Allen [194],\ndemonstrating\
    \ that each species demonstrated its own coefﬁcient of leaf emissivity. Leaves\
    \ showed\nwide ranges of temperature within a crop, often several degrees within\
    \ and between plants because of\nseveral factors. Each plant had (i) speciﬁc leaf\
    \ angles, that may vary during the day for several reasons\n(e.g., leaf turgidity;\
    \ radiation load, etc.); (ii) speciﬁc dimensions of (young and old) leaves, (iii)\
    \ unique\ncanopy architecture, (iv) different LAI, (v) different radiation loads\
    \ that impacted the crop, and (vi)\naerodynamic properties related to the wind\
    \ speed and direction. Therefore, Jones et al. [195] stated that\n“is desirable\
    \ to measure the canopy surface temperature (Tc) as an aggregate of all leaf temperatures”.\
    \ Maes and\nSteppe [153] noted that measurements of Tc differed from those of\
    \ a single leaf for two main reasons.\nCanopy emissivity was larger than leaf\
    \ emissivity, which has the function of capturing radiation\nfor photosynthesis.\
    \ The estimation of canopy emissivity is quite difﬁcult because it requires night\n\
    measurements. A second difference with canopy temperature measurements include\
    \ branches and, in\nparticular, soil which have temperatures usually higher than\
    \ the canopy. This is particularly evident in\norchards and croplands when the\
    \ canopy cover (crop fraction) is low. Furthermore, they reported that\nin stressed\
    \ conditions, at very low leaf stomatal conductance, the total range in surface\
    \ temperature\nbetween leaves is larger than in unstressed conditions, so that\
    \ canopy temperature variability often\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n21 of 36\n\
    reported as an index of drought stress. The sunlit side of a crop tends to have\
    \ a greater variance of\ntemperature among leaves than the shade side.\nSunlit\
    \ and Shade Leaves\nBoth baselines account for fully sunlit canopy leaves, but\
    \ it is evident that the average canopy\ntemperature is a summary of attributes\
    \ of different leaves, an extensive variety of leaf temperatures,\nwith sunlit\
    \ leaves showing much higher temperatures than shaded leaves [156,196]. Both shade\n\
    and sunlit leaves constantly move to adjust light interception to maximize their\
    \ water use efﬁciency\nand protect leaves from excessive heat and radiation load.\
    \ In both well-watered transpiring and\nwater-stressed canopies, there will be\
    \ a wide range of sunlit and shaded leaves, since it is known that\nthat dry matter\
    \ accumulation in crops is directly related to the interception of solar radiation,\
    \ up to the\ncritical LAI.\nAlvino et al. [196] reported that the fraction of\
    \ light absorbed by leaves, which controls crop\ngrowth rate, plant development,\
    \ crop biomass accumulation, is directly related to the interception of\nsolar\
    \ radiation, up to the critical LAI [197]. The light distribution within the canopy\
    \ affects, inter alia,\nthe photosynthetic efﬁciency. Under comparable environmental\
    \ conditions, the most important are the\nlight levels, since leaf photosynthetic\
    \ rates decline with age after leaf full expansion. The complexity is\nmade worse\
    \ by the difﬁculty of estimating the true age of each leaf in a plant community.\
    \ Furthermore,\nthe head-on viewing of a crop may increase the number of leaves\
    \ that appear shaded, even though\nthey are sunlit. As reported by Jones [156],\
    \ “there are always a few sunlit leaves on the shaded side and some\nshaded leaves\
    \ visible on the sunlit side”.\nTesti et al. [175] reported that measurements\
    \ of tall trees are particularly challenging, because\n(i) open sky is within\
    \ the sensor ﬁeld of view; (ii) a tree canopy has a vertical rather than horizontal\n\
    structure; and (iii) there is a canopy temperature difference between the shaded\
    \ and the sunlit sides.\nCrops with genetic modiﬁcations (reduced leaf and modiﬁed\
    \ stipule morphology) may result in\nenhanced yield when water is a limiting factor,\
    \ avoiding drought stress [198].\nIt is still critical to deﬁne a well-watered\
    \ crop, which according to deﬁnition should transpire\nat a rate regulated by\
    \ physical conditions (e.g., VPD), and not present any physical resistance\nto\
    \ transpiration ﬂuxes.\nHowever, even well-watered plants show a midday depression\
    \ of\nstomatal conductance in case of high VPD [199].\nDifferent indices and procedures\
    \ have been\nproposed [108,111,115,153,164,200].\nAs correctly stated by King\
    \ and Shellie [163], the CWSI has not been widely used for irrigated\ncrops since\
    \ it is necessary to acquire the temperature difference of both transpiring and\
    \ non-transpiring\nleaves under the same environmental conditions. Stated below\
    \ King and Shellie [163] obtained\nCWSI values ranging from 0 to 1, when adopting\
    \ the Tair + 5 ◦C for estimating the temperature\nof non-transpiring leaves (Tdry),\
    \ as proposed by Irmak et al. [201] and Möller et al. [108] for corn\nand grape,\
    \ respectively. The authors found that the maximum temperature difference between\
    \ the\ncanopy of deﬁcit-irrigated vines and Tair was inﬂuenced by irrigation frequency.\
    \ Greater maximum\ntemperature differences were found for vines irrigated once\
    \ a week compared to those irrigated three\ntimes per week. The cultivar response\
    \ to deﬁcit irrigation was different with ‘Syrah’ vines, which were\n2–4 ◦C cooler\
    \ than ‘Malbec’ vines [202], and differences were also detected in leaf surface\
    \ temperature\namong grapevine cultivars undergoing water stress. Bellvert et\
    \ al. [202] reported Tnws − Tair values\nmore than 7.5 ◦C for ‘Pinot-noir’ vines\
    \ subject to water stress, when air temperature was 32.3 ◦C and\nair humidity\
    \ 2.37 kPa. In more stressful conditions (37 ◦C and very low air humidity), the\
    \ authors\nmeasured a difference of 13 ◦C in ‘Syrah’ and 17 ◦C in ‘Malbec’ (Tnws\
    \ − Tair). King and Shellie [163]\nreport that a difference between canopy and\
    \ air temperature of vines of about 17 ◦C, which is much\nhigher than with Tdry\
    \ values assumed in other studies and slightly less than the energy balance models\n\
    developed by Jones [111]. Tdry for calculation of the CWSI was estimated as Tair\
    \ + 15 ◦C for both grape\ncultivars, resulting in a CWSI value between 0 and 1\
    \ for irrigation scheduling purposes. The CWSI\nvalue obtained was a good representation\
    \ of a measure of plant water stress.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n22 of 36\nMöller\
    \ et al. [108] studied the effect of different irrigation treatments on grapevines\
    \ for achieving\na higher fruit quality when the vineyard was subjected to mild-to-moderate\
    \ levels of water stress.\nThe authors found a higher accuracy for determining\
    \ CWSI combining thermal and visible images,\nand adopting the following assumptions:\
    \ (i) CWSI calculated with air temperature +5 ◦C and\n(ii) Twet assumed to be\
    \ the average temperature of the wet artiﬁcial reference surface. Other surface\n\
    temperatures were obtained by wetting the canopy surface before thermal image\
    \ acquisition and from\nthe energy balance according to Jones [164]. There was\
    \ a stable linear relationship when Twet was\nderived from the energy balance\
    \ and from image analysis of a wetted part of the canopy. The authors\nsuggested\
    \ in-depth study was needed to develop this calculation as a tool for irrigation\
    \ management\non a ﬁeld scale.\nLópez-López et al. [135] reported that in case\
    \ of no transpiration, the difference between the\nTair and the Tcrop averaged\
    \ 2.8 ◦C (n = 25). Irmak et al. [201] determined an average value of 4.6 ◦C\n\
    for corn.\nOrta et al. [171] determined in a study of trickle-irrigated watermelon\
    \ upper baseline limits of\n3.3 and 3.4 ◦C. Santesteban et al. [173] preferred\
    \ the approach suggested by Jones et al. [156], whereby\nleaves of two sampled\
    \ grapevines were coated on both sides with petroleum jelly to prevent leaf\n\
    transpiration and interrupt the transpiration-cooling phenomenon, simulating the\
    \ leaf physiological\nresponse to water stress conditions. The authors report\
    \ a variation in vineyard temperature range of\nthe (Tdry and Twet) h of about\
    \ 1.3 ◦C and 2.4 ◦C, respectively.\nKing and Shellie [163] adopted a neural model\
    \ to estimate daily mean CWSI starting from\nwell-watered leaf temperatures and\
    \ air temperature plus 15 ◦C for a non-transpiring leaf temperature\n(between\
    \ 13:00 and 15:00 MDT). They were able to discriminate between deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ amounts,\nirrigation events, and rainfall. In contrast, Park et al. [203] estimated\
    \ the lower boundary temperature,\nrepresenting the temperature of fully transpiring\
    \ leaves, while the temperature of a non-transpiring\nleaf (Tdry) was determined\
    \ by air temperature at + 6 ◦C.\nZarco-Tejada et al. [145] found Tc − Tair of\
    \ well-irrigated grapes was effectively determined as\nTc − Tair = 0695 − 1.575\
    \ × VPD.\nMangus et al. [186] derived an instantaneous CWSI using air temperature,\
    \ relative humidity, and\nsolar radiance. Twet reference were empirically found\
    \ using well-watered plants, while a standardized\nTdry reference of 5 ◦C above\
    \ air temperature was utilized to represent the upper leaf temperature.\nThe same\
    \ results were obtained by DeJonge et al. [192] with an upper baseline of 5◦ C\
    \ and a linear\nrelation with VPD.\nGrant et al. [204] studied the effect of the\
    \ canopy architecture on the crop temperatures of two\ngrapevine cultivars grown\
    \ under two irrigation regimes (fully and not irrigated). They concluded that\n\
    it was desirable to calculate an average over several leaves per canopy in order\
    \ to reduce the effect of\nvariation in leaf angles. The simple CWSI, without\
    \ further data acquisition, was sufﬁcient for detecting\nthe relative stress required\
    \ for scheduling irrigation.\nTime of Measurements\nTesti et al. [175] found that\
    \ the CWSI measured in the early afternoon hours was a good\ndescriptor of water\
    \ status of a pistachio orchard. Ghaemi et al. [205] developed baseline equation\
    \ to\ncalculate eggplant CWSI reﬂecting water deﬁcit and salinity stresses, and\
    \ also studied the effect of\ngrowth environment (ﬁeld and greenhouse) on eggplant\
    \ CWSI values and its relationship with crop\nevapotranspiration and yield. CWSI\
    \ values were signiﬁcantly affected by water deﬁcit and salinity,\nand rising\
    \ levels of water salinity decreased the slope of the lower baseline in both crop\
    \ conditions,\nalong with a rise in the upper baseline.\nGarcía-Tejero et al.\
    \ [183] found that the best time to obtain robust and more physiologically\nmeaningful\
    \ thermal data to assess grapevine water status was between 11:00 h and 14:00\
    \ h, independent\nof the variety.\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n23 of 36\nTaghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] found differences in estimating CWSI at different times of day.\
    \ The smallest\ndifference was from 10:00 to 11:00 h and the highest from 12:00\
    \ to 13:00 h periods. In their study,\nthey combined IR thermometry with some\
    \ weather parameters to develop non-water-stressed and\nnon-transpiring baselines\
    \ for irrigated maize in of Colorado (USA).\nKing and Shelliey [163] reported\
    \ that clouds (thin cirrus), often present during the best\ntwo-hour-time for\
    \ CWSI monitoring, rapidly caused changes in levels of solar radiation and, as\n\
    a consequence, an effect on Tnws. They also provided a detailed description of\
    \ physiological variations\nwithin a canopy; particular attention was given to\
    \ rapid changes of leaf temperature in response to\nenvironmental ﬂuctuations\
    \ (e.g., air turbulence, changing radiation). For this reason, they proposed\n\
    the adoption of a 2-h-averaged CWSI value based on 15-min average measured values\
    \ (canopy\ntemperature, air temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, and\
    \ wind speed), which provided\na sound daily CWSI value under variable climatic\
    \ conditions. The results appeared to be consistent\neven when comparing two grape\
    \ cultivars, characterized by different canopy temperature in response\nto climatic\
    \ conditions and irrigation conditions.\nBellvert et al. [172] found a good estimate\
    \ for the calculated daily mean CWSI of well-watered\nleaves between 10:00 and\
    \ 16:00 h. Berni et al. [84], using airborne thermal data of an olive orchard,\n\
    found the best results from 07:30 to 09:30; however, at 12:30 h there was an overestimate\
    \ of canopy\nconductance values. Bellvert et al. [202] found that the correlation\
    \ between CWSI and ΨL had different\nR2 values at different hours of measurements\
    \ (0.46 at 09:30 and 0.71 at 12:30), suggesting that the latter\nwas the more\
    \ favorable time for obtaining thermal images that were linked with ΨL values.\n\
    In Zarco-Tejada et al. [145], CWSI was measured from 13:00 to 15:30 coinciding\
    \ with the times at\nwhich the non-stressed baseline was obtained.\n4.3. Remote\
    \ Sensing and Soil\nSoil moisture measurements are critical components for climate\
    \ studies, hydrology, weather\npredictions, analysis of ﬂooded areas or the recharge\
    \ of aquifers. Real time analysis of the soil water\ncontent is crucial for optimizing\
    \ water management of agricultural ﬁelds.\nNichols et al. [206] presented an overview\
    \ of soil-moisture retrieval methods using different\nremote sensing data (active\
    \ or passive). They reported the advantages and limitations of each method,\n\
    and the evaluation of the most robust methods for retrieving soil-moisture information\
    \ from bare and\nvegetated soils. The best results come from a combination of\
    \ active and passive sensing methods.\nA backscatter empirical model (active method)\
    \ gave a 95–97% correlation between the estimated and\nthe ﬁeld soil measurements.\
    \ The “neural networks method” (passive method) gave a 100% correlation\nbetween\
    \ the estimated and ﬁeld soil measurements.\nRoussel et al. [62] reported the\
    \ adoption of GNSS reﬂectometry (GNSS-R) based on a low-cost\ndevice and an airborne\
    \ solution. For irrigation purposes, the GNSS-R system was useful for soil\nmoisture\
    \ monitoring. Classical probes were not considered representative of the ﬁeld-soil\
    \ moisture\nsince they return punctual measurements. The authors considered the\
    \ soil moisture monitored on a\nlarge scale to be appropriate, even at the expense\
    \ of temporal and/or spatial resolution. Even satellite\nmeasurements were not\
    \ sufﬁcient to monitor diurnal variations.\nYueh et al. [207] provided a review\
    \ of the calibration, validation and assessment of Soil Moisture\nActive Passive\
    \ (SMAP) instruments. The project conducted two activities aimed at enhancing\
    \ the\nproducts’ resolution: (i) the Backus Gilbert interpolation and de-convolution\
    \ techniques based on the\noversampling characteristics of the SMAP radiometer;\
    \ (ii) the disaggregation of the SMAP radiometer\ndata using the Sentinel-1 C-band\
    \ synthetic aperture radar data to obtain a resolution from 1 km to\n3 km.\nMulder\
    \ et al. [208] studied microwave remote sensing of soil moisture content. The\
    \ system was\nfounded on the different dielectric properties of water with respect\
    \ to dry soil. The Soil Water Index\n(SWI) was combined with the METOP ASCAT and\
    \ ENVISAT ASAR GM to obtain one layer with\nhigh resolution (1 km). The authors\
    \ reported another way of assessing soil moisture, the Soil Energy\nHorticulturae\
    \ 2017, 3, 40\n24 of 36\nBALance (SEBAl). All of these models were applied on\
    \ a local scale to produce the actual ET linked to\nsoil water. The authors indicated\
    \ that the most broadly used methods were the SEBAL, the Two-Source\nEnergy Balance\
    \ (TSEB) modeling approach, and the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS).\nMangus\
    \ et al. [186] performed a full-season experiment in a greenhouse with several\
    \ objectives.\nSince CWSI (values between 0.6 and 1.0) was negatively correlated\
    \ to soil moisture, the index may be\nconsidered “as an alternate irrigation scheduling\
    \ method to quantify spatial soil moisture”.\nOther information is reported in\
    \ the previous Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.4.\n4.3.1. Vegetation Indices\nDifferent\
    \ indexes have been set up to estimate different crop parameters (e.g., crop density,\n\
    biomass, chlorophyll, nitrogen, water content, etc.); the Enhanced Vegetation\
    \ Index (EVI), the Soil\nAdjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), the Simple Ratio (SR),\
    \ and the Normalized Difference Vegetation\nIndex (NDVI), are measures of canopy\
    \ greenness, which may be related to physiological processes\nsuch as transpiration\
    \ and photosynthesis [209–211].\nZhao et al. [212] studied the relationship between\
    \ stem water potential (SWP) and VIs extracted\nfrom high spatial resolution images.\n\
    A circle mission was conducted to evaluate the effects\nof bidirectional reﬂectance\
    \ distribution fraction (BRDF) and canopy NDVI mean.\nThe authors\ndemonstrated\
    \ the importance of BRDF to infer SWP from NDVI mean. Circle missions indicated\
    \ that\nview angle inﬂuenced the canopy NDVI. This could lead to a prediction\
    \ error of SWP of up to 12 bars.\nFurther analysis of images identiﬁed a non-normalized\
    \ difference vegetation index (NNDVI) based\non ground-derived measurements over\
    \ three weeks that showed a more signiﬁcant relationship with\nSWP than the canopy\
    \ NDVI mean.\nZúñiga et al. [213], in a study on a remote sensing-based WUE evaluation\
    \ of sub-surface irrigated\ngrape vines, compared several irrigation methods.\
    \ Differences in NDVI values occurred among\ndifferent irrigation strategies (surface\
    \ and subsurface irrigation methods) and when irrigation rates\nwere compared.\
    \ Multispectral satellite imagery, particularly with a red edge waveband, demonstrated\n\
    the potential for quantifying soil-moisture-tension variability, and hence could\
    \ be used for variable rate\nirrigation management. Red Edge Normalized Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index (RENDVI) was especially\nsensitive to soil moisture tension\
    \ and demonstrated that a single image could be representative of\nvariability\
    \ up to two weeks after acquisition. However, it will be necessary to conﬁrm the\
    \ repeatability\nof these results at more maize growth stages and with other crops.\
    \ Finally, an economic study to\nevaluate the monetary and environmental implications\
    \ of such management at a ﬁeld scale would\nhelp transition these ﬁndings into\
    \ adoption by growers [214].\nToureiro et al. [215] presented work on the use\
    \ of remote sensing for measuring soil water\navailability for optimizing crop\
    \ growth. Data were determined by satellite and integrated with\natmosphere and\
    \ crop parameters to calculate biophysical indicators and indices of water stress\n\
    by NDVI, Kc, and Kcb. The results showed that remote sensing based on multispectral\
    \ images\nmay be used, with a high degree of accuracy and spatial representation,\
    \ to calculate crop water\nand irrigation requirements. However, frequent mapping\
    \ of soil water status and crop irrigation\nrequirements would be required; this\
    \ is the weakest point of the satellite imagery methodology used.\nTemporal representation,\
    \ once each 16 days with the Landsat 5 satellite, would not be enough for\nirrigation\
    \ management. The Sentinel 2 satellite is available and could be combined with\
    \ data from\nother satellites to provide more frequent images of the land surface.\n\
    4.3.2. WUE\nMarino et al. [216] evaluated the use of soil and vegetation spectroradiometry\
    \ to investigate crop\nwater use efﬁciency of drip-irrigated tomato. A new instrument\
    \ to measure in-depth soil moisture was\ntested combined with the Hargreaves method\
    \ and VIs with the goal of reducing irrigation volume, to\nassess crop spatial\
    \ variability, and to identify the best VIs related to WUE, at a ﬁeld scale. The\
    \ tomato\nHorticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n25 of 36\ncrop was drip irrigated by an automated\
    \ precision system, which maintained the soil water content\nwithin a speciﬁc\
    \ range related to growth stage and environmental conditions.\nThe instrument\
    \ recorded the soil moisture at different soil depths, providing information on\n\
    the amount of water to apply, taking into account—at each watering—the volume\
    \ of the root zone\nexplored by the crop. The results conﬁrmed that the system\
    \ saved water, applying lower soil water\ndepths than those calculated with the\
    \ Hargreaves formula. The ﬁeld was divided into three clusters,\ncharacterized\
    \ by increasing WUE. The highest (H) cluster showed a WUE value of 35.1 kg·m−3;\n\
    the lowest (L) showed WUE a value of 23.1 kg·m−3. Among VIs tested, the Perpendicular\
    \ vegetation\nindex (PVI), Soil Adjustment Vegetation Index (SAVI), optimized\
    \ Soil Adjustment Vegetation Index\n(OSAVI), and Weighted Difference Vegetation\
    \ (WDVI) were signiﬁcantly related to tomato crop yield.\nThe authors concluded\
    \ that “PVI proved to be a useful tool for (i) a better understanding of the different\
    \ ﬁeld\nproductive areas and for (ii) the adoption of variable water rate application\
    \ according to the different PVI values.\nThe irrigation system adopted proved\
    \ to be effective from agronomic and environmental point of view”.\nSimilar probes\
    \ were used by Nolz et al. [217] to monitor soil water in a vineyard for irrigation\n\
    management. Wang et al. [218] studied the application of quick techniques based\
    \ on thermal imaging\nand visual-NIR spectroscopy for measuring WUE in millet.\
    \ The authors suggested that the exact\nspectral parameters used for measuring\
    \ physiological factors (e.g., E, gs, leaf and WUE) may be used\nfor estimating\
    \ response of crops to changes in the environmental conditions.\n5. Conclusions\n\
    The advances in electronic and information technologies have developed various\
    \ non-invasive\nsensing systems, which return accurate georeferred information\
    \ on spatial variability within ﬁelds.\nThe sensing systems utilize sensors and\
    \ instruments that produce a huge amount of data at\ndifferent scales (temporal\
    \ and spatial) and distances from the target. Remote (satellite, airborne\nand\
    \ UAV imageries) and proximal sensors (mounted on tractors, poles or towers, and\
    \ portable\nspecto-radiometers) are able to detect soil and crop information,\
    \ such as soil status and traits, crop yield,\ncanopy volume and biomass, crop\
    \ water status, and pests (disease, weeds, and insects). These sensing\ntechnologies\
    \ cane be used for precision agriculture and irrigation management.\nSoaring investments\
    \ in R&D have spurred all branches of knowledge linked to RS, boosting the\nproduction\
    \ of reliable and accurate sensors. Temporal frequency of RS imagery has also\
    \ improved\nconsistently, although it has been impaired by considerable lengthening\
    \ of the average times for data\nprocessing. Data processing of images necessitates\
    \ adequate hardware, speciﬁc expertise, skills and\nfunds, which are likely to\
    \ be provided only by specialized reprocessing companies.\nOverall, there are\
    \ numerous studies with spatially distributed information on ET and plant\nwater\
    \ status. These approaches use reﬂectance, including thermal radiance, measurements\
    \ of the\nsurface, vegetation index-based crop coefﬁcients, surface energy balance\
    \ models, and soil water balance\n(although limited to the upper soil layer).\n\
    On a small scale, the focus on time and space has signiﬁcantly improved the monitoring\
    \ of the\ncrop water status of many crops, especially orchards and vineyards.\
    \ The estimation of ET and kc,\nof appearance of biotic and abiotic stresses,\
    \ of crop spatial variability, and of canopy volume have\nbeen improved signiﬁcantly.\
    \ On a ﬁeld scale, the attention paid to soil-water status seems inadequate,\n\
    although soil moisture monitoring is a prerequisite for professionally controlled\
    \ irrigation that satisﬁes\ncrop water requirements (precision irrigation) and\
    \ reduces inefﬁcient spatial allocation of irrigation\nwater, in particular over\
    \ irrigation that causes N leaching. There are current limits of RS, which can\n\
    answer the question of “when to apply water”, because the irrigation volume needs\
    \ to be estimated\nbased on other methods, as wisely pointed out by Taghvaeian\
    \ et al. [182] These other methods,\ninclude—amongst many—the use of electronic\
    \ probes measuring crop water consumption [113], with\nthe aim of deﬁning the\
    \ right water depth to apply to a ﬁeld, and hopefully to each homogeneous area.\n\
    Horticulturae 2017, 3, 40\n26 of 36\nSince positive correlations between crop-water\
    \ status and yield vary among crops, RS studies on\nirrigation should pay more\
    \ attention to ﬁeld production, either in absolute terms (maximizing ﬁeld\nproductivity)\
    \ or in relative terms (higher WUE).\nIn the near future, it is likely that all\
    \ available tools (multi-temporal images combined with\nmodels and improved sensors)\
    \ will contribute to monitoring crop status for triggering irrigation.\nAs mentioned\
    \ above, doubts persist on their ability to estimate the water delivery to the\
    \ ﬁeld for each\ncrop, or to different zones in the case of high crop spatial\
    \ variability.\nA holistic approach is necessary for moving toward precision irrigation.\
    \ It will be necessary\nto set up networks that contemplate the participation\
    \ of public/private partnerships, universities,\nand research institutes, for\
    \ producing multi-temporal images, models, sensors and data sets [94] for\nmanaging\
    \ precision irrigation. Among several EU hubs of excellence, the Quantalab IAS—CSIC\
    \ in\nSpain focuses on quantitative methods for remote sensing in agriculture\
    \ and forestry, for a wide\napplication of precision agriculture and precision\
    \ irrigation, for the assessment of environmental\nimpacts and stress detection.\n\
    Other\nscientists\nare\npursuing\ngrassroots\nremote\nsensing\nand\ndemocratic\n\
    mapping.\nAnderson et al. [93] have generated a toolkit using drones, live coding,\
    \ smartphones and kites.\nFor all institutions developing RS, a key factor will\
    \ be the operational readiness of information\nprovided to farmers and technicians\
    \ for managing irrigation. For irrigation purposes, it will be\nnecessary to develop\
    \ techniques and interpretative frameworks to provide low-cost and affordable\n\
    tools and real-time information to stakeholders involved in the management and\
    \ security of\nagricultural and related sectors.\nAuthor Contributions: Arturo\

    \ and sustainable use of resources (water and soil) is vital to\ndrink and feed\
    \ 9.725 billion by 2050. Agriculture is the ﬁrst source of food production, the\
    \ biggest\nconsumer of freshwater, and the natural ﬁlter of air puriﬁcation. Hence,\
    \ smart agriculture is a “ray of\nhope” in regard to food, water, and environmental\
    \ security. Satellites and artiﬁcial intelligence have\nthe potential to help\
    \ agriculture ﬂourish. This research is an essential step towards achieving smart\n\
    agriculture. Prediction of soil moisture is important for determining when to\
    \ irrigate and how much\nwater to apply, to avoid problems associated with over-\
    \ and under-watering. This also contributes\nto an increase in the number of areas\
    \ being cultivated and, hence, agricultural productivity and\nair puriﬁcation.\
    \ Soil moisture measurement techniques, in situ, are point measurements, tedious,\n\
    time-consuming, expensive, and labor-intensive. Therefore, we aim to provide a\
    \ new approach to\ndetect moisture content in soil without actually being in contact\
    \ with it. In this paper, we propose\na convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture\
    \ that can predict soil moisture content over\nagricultural areas from Sentinel-1\
    \ images. The dual-pol (VV–VH) Sentinel-1 SAR data have being\nutilized (V = vertical,\
    \ H = horizontal). The CNN model is composed of six convolutional layers, one\n\
    max-pooling layer, one ﬂatten layer, and one fully connected layer. The total\
    \ number of Sentinel-\n1 images used for running CNN is 17,325 images. The best\
    \ values of the performance metrics\n(coefﬁcient of determination (R2 = 0.8664),\
    \ mean absolute error (MAE = 0.0144), and root mean\nsquare error (RMSE = 0.0274))\
    \ have been achieved due to the use of Sigma naught VH and Sigma\nnaught VV as\
    \ input data to the CNN architecture (C). Results show that VV polarization is\
    \ better\nthan VH polarization for soil moisture retrieval, and that Sigma naught,\
    \ Gamma naught, and Beta\nnaught have the same inﬂuence on soil moisture estimation.\n\

    \ network (CNN);\nsoil moisture\n1. Introduction\nWater is the “mainspring” that\
    \ determines the survival and development of life on\nEarth. Arable land continues\
    \ to be lost due to urbanization and desertiﬁcation [1]. The\nworld population\
    \ is projected to reach 9.725 billion by 2050 [2]. Accordingly, work should\n\
    be done to increase agricultural production and improve water management, to absorb\n\
    population growth and its requirements for food and water.\nSoil moisture content\
    \ is generally deﬁned as the temporary storage of water within the\nupper layer\
    \ of soil [3]. Knowledge of soil water content plays a pivotal role in improving\n\
    efﬁcient water management [4]. Irrigation scheduling is an important water management\n\
    strategy, which refers to the perfect amount of irrigation to apply to the ﬁeld\
    \ and the perfect\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 4964. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13244964\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 4964\n2 of\
    \ 17\ntiming for application [5]. Irrigation scheduling depends on the estimate\
    \ of the soil moisture\ncontent [6]. The measurement of soil moisture content\
    \ in situ is hard and expensive\nbecause it necessitates a repeated sampling process\
    \ to analyze the periodical changes\nin soil moisture [7]. All soil moisture content\
    \ measurement methods are divided into\ntwo broad categories—direct and indirect\
    \ monitoring [8]. The most common techniques\nused for estimating soil moisture\
    \ content in situ are gravimetric, neutron probe, time\ndomain reﬂectometry (TDR),\
    \ frequency domain reﬂectometry (FDR), and tensiometer\ntechniques [9].\nResearch\
    \ in the retrieval of soil moisture from satellite imagery has been vital in the\n\
    past three decades, and we expect this trend to continue into the following decades.\
    \ Surface\nsoil moisture (SSM) is the water content available in the upper 0–5\
    \ cm of the soil layer,\nwhereas the water that is available to plants is called\
    \ root zone soil moisture, which is\ngenerally considered to be in the upper 0–200\
    \ cm of soil layer [9]. Therefore, estimating\nthe amount of soil moisture in\
    \ the root zone is more valuable and effective than surface\nsoil moisture in\
    \ agricultural and hydrological applications [10]. Direct determination of\nsoil\
    \ moisture in the root zone by remote sensing satellites is a laborious task and\
    \ a serious\nchallenge [11]. Direct soil observations are only possible in the\
    \ case of bare soil (i.e., absence\nof vegetation) and, therefore, detecting soil\
    \ moisture using remote sensing is suitable for\na few days per year [12]. Compared\
    \ to the visible and infrared, microwaves have many\nspecial qualities and advantages\
    \ that are important for remote sensing [13]. Microwaves\nhave long wavelengths—radiations\
    \ can penetrate cloud cover, haze, and dust [14]. This\ncharacteristic enables\
    \ detection of microwave energy in all environmental and weather\nconditions;\
    \ hence, the ability to collect and capture data anytime [15]. Microwave remote\n\
    sensing methods are suited for the detection and determination of soil moisture\
    \ in the upper\ncentimeters of the soil [16]. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite\
    \ imaging is a promising\nmethod for soil moisture monitoring [17]. SAR systems\
    \ can be used to investigate and\nretrieve soil moisture (0–5 cm depth) over agricultural\
    \ areas [18]. The Sentinel-1 (S1) satellite\ncharacteristics include high spatial\
    \ resolution and high revisit time; hence, Sentinel-1 is\nsuitable for mapping\
    \ and monitoring soil moisture over agricultural areas [19]. Sentinel-1\nimages\
    \ can be used to retrieve soil moisture over wheat-covered areas [20]. VV polarization\n\
    was more sensitive for soil moisture retrieval from Sentinel-1 data as compared\
    \ to VH\npolarization [21–23]. Several studies have indicated that the accuracy\
    \ of the soil moisture\nestimates improved when using both VV and VH polarization,\
    \ instead of only VV or VH\npolarization [24–26].\nArtiﬁcial intelligence is an\
    \ integrated environment of various scientiﬁc ﬁelds [27].\nArtiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ is the simulation of human intelligence in machines [28]. Machine\nlearning\
    \ is one of the most important branches of artiﬁcial intelligence [29]. Machine\
    \ learn-\ning aims to develop algorithms that are capable of learning, improving,\
    \ and generalizing\nfrom a given collection of examples [30] without being explicitly\
    \ programmed [31]. Deep\nlearning is a specialized subset of machine learning\
    \ [32]. In deep learning, a convolutional\nneural network (CNN) is a special class\
    \ of artiﬁcial neural networks [33]. CNN is famous\nfor its accurate and computationally\
    \ efﬁcient, powerful learning ability, and automatic\nhigh-level feature extraction\
    \ [34]. CNN is one of the best available techniques for unstruc-\ntured data types\
    \ [35]. CNN has showed impressive achievements across a wide variety of\ndomains,\
    \ especially in computer vision related ﬁelds [36]. CNN is most commonly applied\n\
    to analyze images [37], and feature extraction from images [38]. CNN can achieve\
    \ a better\nperformance than the linear regression model [39], and the support\
    \ vector regression [40].\nFrom the above, we conclude that all soil moisture\
    \ measurement methods under ﬁeld\nconditions are accurate with varying degrees.\
    \ Common challenges and problems that exist\nin soil moisture measurement methods\
    \ under ﬁeld conditions are (1) point measurement\nmethods (meaning, these techniques\
    \ can only express soil moisture at speciﬁc points,\nand not at the entire cultivated\
    \ area). (2) Regular periodic maintenance, thus require\nintensive labor. (3)\
    \ The need for site-speciﬁc calibration. (4) The actual contact with the soil;\n\
    and (5) the costs. We, therefore, intend to provide a new approach to knowing\
    \ moisture\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 4964\n3 of 17\ncontent in soil without actually\
    \ being in contact with it. In this paper, we propose a\nconvolutional neural\
    \ network (CNN) architecture that can predict soil moisture content\nfrom Sentinel-1\
    \ images.\n2. Material and Methods\nSoil moisture detection is the ﬁrst step in\
    \ the practical implementation of water\nmanagement. This paper proposes an algorithm\
    \ for automatically detecting soil moisture\nin the root zone (0–20 cm) by using\
    \ CNN and satellite imagery. We focused on the soil\nmoisture retrieval from Sentinel-1\
    \ images. This study was conducted from 15 June 2014 to\n1 November 2020.\n2.1.\
    \ Study Area and Data Acquisition\nTo achieve the soil moisture content estimation\
    \ algorithm, two networks were se-\nlected. The two networks are OZNET and WEGENERNET.\
    \ These networks are part of\nthe International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN).\
    \ ISMN is an important source for soil\nmoisture data, it is a set of networks\
    \ distributed globally [41,42]. Access to the data are\nfreely available at (https://ismn.geo.tuwien.ac.at/en/\
    \ (accessed on 13 November 2020)).\nThe ISMN database is a necessary and crucial\
    \ means for validating and improving satellite\nsoil moisture products [43].\n\
    The OZNET network is located in Murrumbidgee catchment, South Eastern Australia.\n\
    This is a suitable place for assessing the skills and abilities of each satellite\
    \ to remotely sense\nthe soil moisture. In this region, the climate ranges from\
    \ semiarid to humid. Moreover, soil\ntexture ranges from sand to clay. The Murrumbidgee\
    \ catchment contains 38 soil moisture-\nmonitoring stations on three subareas.\
    \ These areas are Adelong Creek catchment, Kyeamba\nCreek catchment, and the Yanco\
    \ region. In this study, only 17 stations were selected\n(6 stations in Kyeamba\
    \ Creek catchment and 11 stations in Yanco region). Kyeamba Creek\ncatchment is\
    \ about 600 km2 with gentle slopes; land use is mainly for grazing for sheep\n\
    and beef, with some dairy. The Yanco Region is ﬂat with an area of 2500 km2; land\
    \ use\ncomprises dryland farming (in the north of the region), native pasture\
    \ (southeast), and\nirrigation with barley and rice as the main rotation crops\
    \ (west). Within each station,\nCampbell Scientiﬁc (CS615 or CS616 or Stevens\
    \ Hydra Probe) water content reﬂectometers\nwere used to measure soil moisture\
    \ content. In addition, time domain reﬂectometry (TDR)\nprobes were installed\
    \ for calibrating the reﬂectometers. Site measured soil moisture data\nare recorded\
    \ every 20 min and at three depths on the soil. Additionally, each station\nmeasures\
    \ soil temperature, precipitation, soil suction, wind speed, air temperature,\
    \ relative\nhumidity, and ancillary data. More information and a detailed explanation\
    \ of this network\nare provided in [44,45]. OZNET network data are freely available\
    \ in (http://www.oznet.\norg.au/ (accessed on 13 November 2020)). Primary information\
    \ about stations used is\nsummarized in (Table 1).\nThe WegenerNet network is\
    \ located in the Feldbach region, southeastern Styria,\nAustria. This location\
    \ is good and suitable for satellite product calibration and validation.\nFeldbach\
    \ region is affected by continental and Mediterranean climates. This region is\n\
    characterized by hot and rainy summers, and cold winters [46]. WegenerNet network\n\
    is a pioneering meteorological station network. It covers an area of approximately\
    \ 22 ×\n16 km and contains 155 stations including 12 soil moisture-monitoring\
    \ stations, which\nwere numbered 6, 15, 19, 27, 34, 50, 54, 77, 78, 84, 85, and\
    \ 99. The land where the stations\nare located is used for many different purposes:\
    \ the land of the stations 6, 19, 50, 77,\n78, 84, and 85 for grassland; the land\
    \ of the stations 15, 34, 54, and 99 for meadow; and\nthe land of the station\
    \ 27 for fruit trees. The dominant soil texture is sandy loam in all\nstation\
    \ sites, except station 19, soil texture is silty clay. Inside each station, Stevens\
    \ Hydra\nProbe II was used to measure soil moisture at a depth of 0–20 cm. In\
    \ this study, level\n2 half-hourly data from version 7 were used. Furthermore,\
    \ each station measures soil\nconductivity, soil temperature, diode temperature,\
    \ air temperature, relative humidity, pF-\nvalue, precipitation, and ancillary\
    \ data. For additional information, a detailed description\nRemote Sens. 2021,\

    2.2. Sentinel-1 Data Pre-Processing\nIn this paper, we aimed to retrieve soil\
    \ moisture from Sentinel-1 imagery. The Sentinel-\n1 radar mission was composed\
    \ of a constellation of two satellites, Sentinel-1A (launched\non 3 April 2014)\
    \ and Sentinel-1B (launched on 25 April 2016) [50]. A revisit time improved\n\
    from 12 to 6 days, by using both Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B [51–53]. Sentinel-1\
    \ provides\ndata at high spatial resolution (10 × 10 m) [54–56]. Sentinel-1 carries\
    \ a dual-polarization\nC-band synthetic aperture radar sensor [57]. Dual-polarization\
    \ acquisitions are VV and\nVH or HH and HV (V = vertical, H = horizontal) [58].\
    \ Sentinel-1 data are freely available,\naccessible, and downloadable for everyone.\n\
    The Level-1 Ground-Range Detected High-Res Dual-Pol (GRD-HD) products in the\n\
    interferometric wide swath (IW) mode were used in this research. Sentinel-1 data\
    \ used in\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 4964\n5 of 17\nthis study are available in dual-polarization,\
    \ VV and VH. We downloaded all available\nSentinel-1 data between 15 June 2014\
    \ and 1 November 2020 (see Tables 1 and 2) from the\nAlaska Satellite Facility\
    \ (ASF) (https://search.asf.alaska.edu (accessed on 17 November\n2020)). The data\
    \ obtained from ASF needed to be pre-processed before they were used. Pre-\nprocessing\
    \ of Sentinel-1 images were performed with the open-source processing software\n\
    SNAP (version 7.0), provided by the European Space Agency, which contains a collection\n\
    of tools for processing Sentinel-1 data. Batch processing is one of the most useful\
    \ tools in\nSNAP that can save manual effort, reduce processing time, and easily\
    \ automate repetitive\ntasks. Use the graph builder of SNAP to create a processing\
    \ chain ﬁrst, and then use the\nbatch-processing tool.\nIn this paper, the processing\
    \ chain consists of eight steps: subset, apply orbit ﬁle,\nthermal noise removal,\
    \ border noise removal, calibration, multi-looking, speckle ﬁltering,\nand terrain\
    \ correction. Soil moisture monitoring station covers a small area of land, while\n\
    the satellite image covers a very large area. The ﬁrst step should therefore be\
    \ to determine\nand create a subset of a Sentinel-1 product (5 × 5 km) this part\
    \ is much larger than is\nrequired in this study), which facilitates and speeds\
    \ up the following pre-processing steps.\nThe following three steps were: apply\
    \ orbit ﬁle, thermal noise removal, and border noise\nremoval, respectively, all\
    \ run using the default settings. Then, the radiometric calibra-\ntion was performed\
    \ by selecting the Sigma naught (Sigma0), Gamma naught (Gamma0),\nand Beta naught\
    \ (Beta0) as output bands. Multi-looking was then implemented without\nchanging\
    \ the default settings. The next step was to conduct speckle ﬁltering. The Lee\
    \ ﬁlter\nwas implemented using kernel size (3 × 3). Terrain correction (Using\
    \ SRTM 1Sec HGT\n(Auto-Download)) was the ﬁnal pre-processing step during this\
    \ study. We just ﬁnished the\npre-processing of Sentinel-1 data and we have images\
    \ (5 × 5 km). Afterward, shapeﬁles\nwere created in ArcGIS for the areas covered\
    \ by each station, so that each region (station)\nhas a shapeﬁle. The shapeﬁle\
    \ was square and the center of a shapeﬁle is where the soil\nmoisture sensor was\
    \ installed. Then, we used SNAP to subset the images using shapeﬁle.\nWe can now\
    \ say that all images had the same size, the center of all images was the soil\n\
    moisture sensor, and they were fully ready to be trained and tested. Every Sentinel-1\
    \ image\nconsists of six bands: Sigma0_VH, Gamma0_VH, Beta0_VH, Sigma0_VV, Gamma0_VV,\n\
    and Beta0_VV.\n2.3. Model Establishment\nA convolutional neural network (CNN)\
    \ is useful for researchers. CNN is an invaluable\nand indispensable tool to deal\
    \ with satellite images. In general, the CNN structure mainly\nconsists of an\
    \ input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The hidden layers\n\
    of a CNN are typically comprised of convolutional layers, nonlinearity layers,\
    \ pooling\nlayers, and fully connected layers. A convolution layer is responsible\
    \ for feature extraction.\nA nonlinearity layer mainly consists of an activation\
    \ function (activation functions used\ntanh, sigmoid, ReLU, and linear). Activation\
    \ functions are a critical part of the design of\nthe network. In the hidden layer,\
    \ the activation function type controls how well the model\nlearns the training\
    \ dataset. In the output layer, the activation function type deﬁnes the type\n\
    of predictions the model can make. The pooling layer works to reduce the size\
    \ of the input\nimages by keeping the most important features only. The output\
    \ of convolution layers and\npooling layers is the input to the fully connected\
    \ layers to get the ﬁnal output (prediction\nof soil moisture content). For more\
    \ information on designing CNN structures, see [59,60].\nThe overarching goal\
    \ was to create a CNN model capable of predicting or retrieving\nsoil moisture\
    \ from satellite imagery with high efﬁciency and accuracy. The harder, more\n\
    important step involves identifying the best-performing architecture. Figure 1\
    \ illustrates\nthe perfect design in terms of the number of layers used (this\
    \ is a result of many attempts\nand tests), which are appropriate for this type\
    \ of data. One of the most useful features\nof CNN is the possibility of using\

    \ with Sentinel-1 data. The most common\nare: cross-ratio (CR = σ0\nVH/σ0\nVV)\
    \ [61], Ratio (Ratio = σ0\nVV/σ0\nVH) [62–64], radar vegeta-\ntion index (RVI\

    \ indices as input data to the CNN model on the soil moisture retrieval.\nThe\
    \ total number of Sentinel-1 images used for running CNN is 17,325 images. During\n\
    the ﬁtting of the model, we split our dataset randomly into two parts: 80% for\

    \ Polarization as Input Data to the CNN Model on the Soil\nMoisture Retrieval\n\
    With this study, we found that the most appropriate CNN architecture for Sentinel-1\n\
    data are CNN architecture (C), as elaborated later in this paper. Therefore, we\
    \ sufﬁce\nwith presenting its ﬁndings. Figure 2 summarizes the results obtained\
    \ on Sentinel-1\nbands, which were achieved by using the CNN model (CNN architecture\
    \ (C)) proposed\nin this study. This ﬁgure illustrates the relationship between\
    \ in-situ soil moisture and\npredicted soil moisture, clarifying R2, MAE, and\
    \ RMSE metrics, for (1) each band separately;\n(2) Sigma0_VH and Sigma0_VV; (3)\
    \ Gamma0_VH and Gamma0_VV; (4) Beta0_VH and\nBeta0_VV; (5) all VH bands together;\
    \ (6) all VV bands together; and (7) all VH and VV\nbands (6 bands).\nIn all,\
    \ we noticed that VV bands were better than VH bands for soil moisture retrieval,\n\
    but the best way is to use both at the same time (e.g., Sigma0_VH and Sigma0_VV).\
    \ The\ncoefﬁcients of determination (R2) for Sigma0_VH, Gamma0_VH, and Beta0_VH\
    \ are 0.8078,\n0.8023, and 0.8002, respectively. Similarly, R2 for Sigma0_VV,\
    \ Gamma0_VV, and Beta0_VV\nare 0.8399, 0.8337, and 0.8323, respectively. With\
    \ the use of both VH and VV bands,\nR2 values have improved to 0.8664, 0.8554,\
    \ and 0.8527 for Sigma0_VH and Sigma0_VV,\nGamma0_VH and Gamma0_VV, and Beta0_VH\
    \ and Beta0_VV, respectively. In the light\nof the current ﬁndings: Arguably,\
    \ Sigma0, Gamma0, and Beta0 have the same inﬂuence\non soil moisture estimation.\
    \ In essence, Sigma0, Gamma0, or Beta0 can be used to predict\nsoil moisture content,\
    \ but the best is to use Sigma0. When comparing the result obtained\nfrom the\
    \ use of all VH bands together with the result obtained from the use of each VH\n\
    band separately, and between use of all VV bands together with the use of each\
    \ VV band\nseparately, we will ﬁnd that (1) use of three bands (VH or VV) together\
    \ causes a decrease\nin soil moisture retrieval efﬁciency; (2) the R2 value has\
    \ reduced to 0.777 with use all VH\nbands together; and (3) the R2 value has reduced\
    \ to 0.8152 with use all VV bands together.\nBy using all VH and VV bands, the\
    \ value of R2 has amounted to 0.8277.\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 4964\n8 of 17\n\
    \ \nto predict soil moisture content, but the best is to use Sigma0. When comparing\
    \ the result \nobtained from the use of all VH bands together with the result\
    \ obtained from the use of \neach VH band separately, and between use of all VV\
    \ bands together with the use of each \nVV band separately, we will find that\
    \ (1) use of three bands (VH or VV) together causes a \ndecrease in soil moisture\
    \ retrieval efficiency; (2) the R2 value has reduced to 0.777 with use \nall VH\
    \ bands together; and (3) the R2 value has reduced to 0.8152 with use all VV bands\
    \ \ntogether. By using all VH and VV bands, the value of R2 has amounted to 0.8277.\
    \ \n \nFigure 2. An illustration of the effect of Sentinel-1 bands on the soil\
    \ moisture retrieval accuracy over agricultural areas. \nFigure 2. An illustration\
    \ of the effect of Sentinel-1 bands on the soil moisture retrieval accuracy over\
    \ agricultural areas.\nFrom the above, it will be clear that (1) soil moisture\
    \ retrieval efﬁciency was good\nwith 1 input channels (Sigma0_VH or Sigma0_VV\
    \ or Gamma0_VH or Gamma0_VV or\nBeta0_VH or Beta0_VV); (2) it was further improved\
    \ with 2 input channels (Sigma0_VH\nand Sigma0_VV or Gamma0_VH and Gamma0_VV or\
    \ Beta0_VH and Beta0_VV); and (3) it\nwas worsened with three input channels (all\
    \ VH or VV bands) and with six input channels\n(all VH and VV bands).\nTo explain\
    \ that, we must be fully aware that the machine learning algorithm’s accuracy\n\
    depends on the quality of the input data [73,74]. Multiple studies reveal a positive\
    \ correla-\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 4964\n9 of 17\ntion between the number of features\
    \ and accuracy; that is until it peaks, but then it will\nturn to a negative correlation.\
    \ The proper features can certainly increase the accuracy [75].\nRedundant and\
    \ irrelevant features may lead to confusion in the learning system [76].\nRemoving\
    \ these features can help avoid degradation of learning performance [77].\nWe\
    \ can convert from Beta naught (β0) to Sigma naught (σ0) or Gamma naught (γ0)\n\
    by multiplying Beta naught by a speciﬁc number, as follows: (σ0\n=\nβ0 × sin θ)\
    \ and\n(γ0 = β0 × tan θ), where (θ) is the incidence angle [78,79]. We can therefore\
    \ consider\nSigma naught, Gamma naught, and Beta naught as mirror bands or mirror\
    \ images or\nredundant images. The only differences are the minimum and maximum\
    \ values of the\nbackscattering coefﬁcient. As a result, we notice that the values\
    \ of the performance metrics\nfor Sigma0_VH, Gamma0_VH, and Beta0_VH look the\
    \ same. Moreover, the values of the\nperformance metrics for Sigma0_VV, Gamma0_VV,\
    \ and Beta0_VV look the same.\nWhen we use all VH bands together as input data,\
    \ the Gamma and Beta could be\nregarded as redundant features of Sigma. Similarly,\
    \ this also applies to the use of all VV\nbands together as input data. Hence,\
    \ we believe that redundant features were the main\nreason for the degradation\
    \ of the performance metrics (R2, MAE, and RMSE) with the use\nof all VH bands\
    \ together, all VV bands together, and both VH and VV bands; in comparison\nwith\
    \ the values of the performance metrics for each band separately, Sigma0_VH and\n\
    Sigma0_VV, Gamma0_VH and Gamma0_VV, and Beta0_VH and Beta0_VV.\n3.2. Inﬂuence\
    \ of Cross-Ratio, Ratio, RVI, NRPB and DPSVI as Input Data to the CNN Model on\n\
    the Soil Moisture Retrieval\nFigure 3 summarizes the ﬁndings obtained from the\
    \ use of indicators as input data\nto the CNN. The best indicators for soil moisture\
    \ retrieval is Cross-Ratio (R2 = 0.7436),\nfollowed by Ratio (R2 = 0.743), then\
    \ DPSVI (R2 = 0.741), followed by RVI (R2 = 0.7351),\nand ﬁnally NRPB (R2\n=\n\
    0.7346). The values of the coefﬁcients of determination for\nindicators ranging\
    \ from 0.7436 to 0.7346. One explanation for this tiny range of the\ndifference\
    \ is that all the indicators depended only on Sigma0, as illustrated earlier by\n\
    the equations.\nAs shown in Figure 3, there are substantial declines in the values\
    \ of the performance met-\nrics (R2 = 0.6965, MAE = 0.025, RMSE = 0.0414), due\
    \ to using all indicators as input to\nthe CNN. Moreover, the use of all Sentinel-1\
    \ bands and indicators together (six bands and five\nindicators) as input data\
    \ to the CNN instead of using all Sentinel-1 bands, led to a decline in the\n\
    values of the performance metrics from (R2 = 0.8277, MAE = 0.0194, RMSE = 0.0312)\n\
    to (R2 = 0.7973, MAE = 0.0238, RMSE = 0.0338). All of this conﬁrms what has been\n\
    interpreted regarding the impact of redundant features on learning performance.\n\
    According to these results, the use of indicators instead of original Sentinel-1\
    \ bands\nas input data to the CNN to retrieve soil moisture from Sentinel-1 images\
    \ is not recom-\nmended. We can now say that the top three inputs to CNN are Sigma0_VH\
    \ and Sigma0_VV,\nGamma0_VH and Gamma0_VV, and Beta0_VH and Beta0_VV. However,\
    \ the best of all is\nSigma0_VH and Sigma0_VV.\nRemote Sens. 2021, 13, 4964\n\

    4. Conclusions\nAgriculture is closely linked to food, water, and air. Smart agriculture\
    \ is a “ray of\nhope” for food, water, and environmental security. Satellites\
    \ and artiﬁcial intelligence are\nnecessary tools to achieve smart agriculture.\
    \ Due to rapid technological development in\nour time and an increase in the number\
    \ of satellites, we will soon be able to obtain high\nspatial resolution images\
    \ of the Earth once or twice a day. Artiﬁcial intelligence can analyze\nand understand\
    \ a large amount of data effectively and efﬁciently.\nSoil moisture content is\
    \ one of the decisive conditions required for crop growth and\ndevelopment and\
    \ its precise prediction is important for determining when to irrigate and\nhow\
    \ much water to apply; this helps avoid problems associated with over- and under-\n\
    watering. This also contributes to an increase in areas cultivated and, hence,\
    \ agricultural\nproductivity and air puriﬁcation. Gravimetric, neutron probe,\
    \ TDR probe, FDR probe,\ntensiometer probe technique are the most common techniques\
    \ used for estimating soil\nmoisture content in situ. All of these techniques\
    \ under ﬁeld conditions are accurate with\nvarying degrees. However, the most\
    \ common challenges and problems that still exist with\nthese techniques under\
    \ ﬁeld conditions are (1) point measurement methods; (2) regular\nperiodic maintenance,\
    \ thus require intensive labor; (3) the need for site-speciﬁc calibration;\n(4)\
    \ the actual contact with the soil; (5) the costs.\nTherefore, in this paper,\
    \ we proposed a new approach to detect moisture content in soil\nwithout actually\
    \ being in contact with it. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)\n\
    architecture that can predict soil moisture content over agricultural areas from\
    \ Sentinel-1 images.\nThe best values of the performance metrics (R2 = 0.8664,\
    \ MAE = 0.0144, RMSE = 0.0274)\nwere achieved as a result of using Sigma0_VH and\
    \ Sigma0_VV as input to the CNN\narchitecture (C). The pre-processing steps have\
    \ a strong, effective, and direct inﬂuence\non soil moisture retrieval from Sentinel-1\
    \ images. Using VV bands as input data to the\nCNN is better than using VH bands\
    \ for soil moisture retrieval. The use of indicators\ninstead of original Sentinel-1\
    \ bands as input data to the CNN to retrieve soil moisture from\nSentinel-1 images\
    \ is not recommended. We recommend using Sigma0_VH and Sigma0_VV\nor Gamma0_VH\
    \ and Gamma0_VV or Beta0_VH and Beta0_VV as input data to the CNN\nto predict\
    \ soil moisture content from Sentinel-1 images.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    Compressed vintages, high alcohol and low wine acidity are but a few

    repercussions of climate change effects on Australian viticulture. While warm

    and cool growing regions may have different practical concerns related to

    climate change, they both experience altered berry and must composition and

    potentially reduced desirable wine characteristics and market value. Storms,

    drought and uncertain water supplies combined with excessive heat not only

    depress vine productivity through altered physiology but can have direct

    consequences on the fruit. Sunburn, shrivelling and altered sugar-ﬂavour-

    aroma balance are becoming more prevalent while bushﬁres can result in

    smoke taint. Moreover, distorted pest and disease cycles and changes in

    pathogen geographical distribution have altered biotic stress dynamics that

    require novel management strategies. A multipronged approach to address

    these challenges may include alternative cultivars and rootstocks or changing

    geographic location. In addition, modifying and incorporating novel irrigation

    regimes, vine architecture and canopy manipulation, vineyard ﬂoor

    management, soil amendments and foliar products such as antitranspirants

    and other ﬁlm-forming barriers are potential levers that can be used to manage

    the effects of climate change. The adoption of technology into the vineyard

    including weather, plant and soil sensors are giving viticulturists extra tools
    to

    make quick decisions, while satellite and airborne remote sensing allow the

    adoption of precision farming. A coherent and comprehensive approach to

    climate risk management, with consideration of the environment, ensures that

    optimum production and exceptional fruit quality is maintained. We review the

    preliminary ﬁndings and feasibility of these new strategies in the

    Australian context.

    1 Emerging challenges

    Terroir is the result of an interaction between climate, soil,

    landscape characteristics, topography and biodiversity for a

    particular cultivar within the vineyard and aside from the

    inherent natural environment, it also encompasses the cultural

    management of a site. It refers to “the interactions between the

    identiﬁable physical and biological environment and applied

    vitivinicultural practices, providing distinctive characteristics for

    the products originating from this area” (OIV, 2010). Of these

    factors, temperature is undoubtedly a strong driving force for

    vine and fruit development (Jones and Davis, 2000; Jones and

    Alves, 2012). The Mediterranean climate is considered ideal for

    viticulture. Hence, warm, dry summers are accompanied by cool,

    wet winters and these combinations of temperature, light and

    water drive the desirable evolution of berry aroma, colour and

    ﬂavour in hundreds of grape cultivars (Keller, 2010). That said,

    grapevines are grown with economic success across a range of

    climatic zones, resulting in highly diverse wine styles (Van

    Leeuwen et al., 2004). However, heat, drought, wildﬁres,

    excessive rain events and increased pest and disease pressure

    are posing new challenges for viticulture. Additionally, many

    viticultural regions are consistently experiencing a general

    phenological advancement in ﬂowering, veraison and maturity.

    These trends and emerging challenges have been, at least

    partially, attributed to a changing climate (Caffarra and Eccel,

    2010; Bonnefoy et al., 2013; Malheiro et al., 2013; Cola et al.,

    2017; Jarvis et al., 2017; Alikadic et al., 2019; Cameron

    et al., 2022).

    Alongside the ambient temperature rise, Australia has been

    subjected to more extreme climatic events like heatwaves,

    wildﬁres and shifts in the timing and volume of rain (Abram

    et al., 2021). In February 2009, Eastern Australia witnessed

    extreme temperatures and one of the most devastating ﬁres on

    record. Another extreme heat event occurred in December 2012-

    January 2013 across 70% of Australia with temperature records

    in every state and territory. The maximum temperature averaged

    across Australia was the hottest ever recorded at 40.3°C.

    Furthermore, a frost in November 2017 across South Australia

    wiped out 30,000 tonnes of grapes, while hail during ﬂowering in

    2017 in the Riverina region of NSW resulted in complete crop

    loss. These are genuine current examples of extreme climatic

    effects on viticultural productivity. Additionally, the

    unprecedented 2019-20 Black Summer bushﬁres occurred

    during record breaking temperatures and very low rainfall.

    These ﬁres were classiﬁed as ‘megaﬁres’ with nearly 19 million

    hectares of land destroyed and with an extreme impact on

    biodiversity and at least one billion vertebrate animals lost

    (Filkov et al., 2020). This disaster also resulted in extensive

    social and economic impacts, including smoke-related effects on

    public health and on vineyards in many of the affected wine-

    growing regions.

    Australian viticulture stretches from the southernmost

    latitudes of Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia

    northward into New South Wales and Queensland and it has

    been projected that by 2050 a warming climate will reduce the

    suitable area available for cultivation by 22-73% (Hannah et al.,

    2013); this is despite factoring in estimates of emerging novel

    areas for cultivation. These projections, however, are based on

    existing cultivars and current management strategies. The

    adoption of new cultivars and integration of adaptive measures

    to tackle these mounting climate pressures will certainly lessen

    the severity of these predictions (Van Leeuwen et al., 2013;

    Mosedale et al., 2016). However, research and knowledge

    transfer are required now allowing appropriate practical

    strategies to be implemented (Santos et al., 2020).

    1.1 Heat stress

    The growing season mean temperature is an important

    driver for root, canopy and reproductive development.

    Grapevines can be cultivated in average growing season

    temperatures with a lower and upper threshold of 12-13°C

    and 22-24°C (Schultz and Jones, 2010). Once endo- and eco-

    dormancy are broken, temperatures above 7-10°C will drive

    budburst (Amerine and Winkler, 1944), followed by new

    vegetative growth and the emergence of the inﬂorescences.

    Warm temperatures will encourage development of the

    canopy, but later in the season, if temperatures reach above

    35°C, heat stress will impact on the physiology of the vine.

    Temperatures can exceed 40°C for prolonged periods in

    Australia and this will have an impact on carbon assimilation

    and thus sugar accumulation by grapes (Greer and Weston,

    2010). The process of photosynthesis is vulnerable to

    temperatures due reductions in carboxylation by ribulose 1,5-

    bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) and the

    regeneration of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) (Greer and

    Weedon, 2012). Heat is also often combined with low humidity

    and therefore, to prevent water stress, stomata will close.

    The berries themselves are vulnerable to heat stress with

    repercussions on berry composition and wine quality. Aside

    from impact on primary metabolites such as sugars (Greer and

    Weston, 2010; Pillet et al., 2012), organic acids (Sweetman et al.,

    2014) and amino acids (Lecourieux et al., 2017), secondary

    metabolites responsible for the sensory attributes are also

    altered. Flavonoids are affected by high temperatures, but

    outcomes depend on the heat intensity, duration, phenological

    stage and genotype (Gouot et al., 2019). Anthocyanin changes

    were attributed to a combination of changes in gene expression,

    enzyme activity, degradation and relocation (Gouot et al., 2019).

    Additionally, molecular data pointed toward cell wall changes

    (Lecourieux et al., 2017) with potential ramiﬁcations on berry

    texture. Cell walls of berry skin cells became more extensible

    Rogiers et al.

    10.3389/fpls.2022.1094633

    Frontiers in Plant Science

    perhaps to enable berry contraction and expansion to occur

    between the day and night extremes. Elevated canopy

    temperature can accelerate late ripening mesocarp cell death

    and berry desiccation (i.e. shrivelling) in susceptible cultivars

    (Bonada et al., 2013a). High temperature may exacerbate late

    ripening cell death by increasing respiration within the berries.

    Due to reduced oxygen diffusivity in late ripening berries, the

    mesocarp can become hypoxic, resulting in localised anaerobic

    fermentation which leads to ethanol accumulation (Xiao et al.,

    2018b). Excessive radiation, in combination with heat, can result

    in sunburn, especially on the western side of the canopy (Greer

    and Weedon, 2013; Greer et al., 2006). Sun exposure and the

    microclimate of the bunch will dictate berry temperature and,

    therefore, careful manipulation of the canopy may play an

    important role in berry attributes, and indeed berry survival

    during an extreme temperature event.

    1.2 Water deﬁcits

    Water deﬁcits can impact on vegetative growth,

    inﬂorescence development, berry set and berry development,

    though dependent on the phenological stage, severity and

    duration of the water deﬁcit (Hardie and Considine, 1976).

    Photosynthesis occurs at the expense of transpiration, with the

    efﬁciency of carbon gain dependent on cultivar. Mild deﬁcits

    may result in stomatal limitations, but more severe deﬁcits will

    result in non-stomatal limitations, affecting photosynthesis

    (Lovisolo et al., 2010). Drought tolerant cultivars with

    adequate stomatal control and water-use efﬁciency are a

    priority; as leaf water potential declines, hydraulic conductivity

    can by maintained through stomatal closure. Shiraz and

    Semillon, for instance, are situated on the anisohydric end of

    the isohdyric to anisohydric spectrum and can suffer from water

    stress (Schultz, 2003; Rogiers et al., 2009). However, cultivar

    behaviour is not always clearly aligned to one or the other end of

    the spectrum, and may be inconsistent (Charrier et al., 2018).

    Stomatal regulation and transpiration are strongly inﬂuenced by

    the environment, even during the night (Rogiers and Clarke,

    2013). However, unfavourable conditions may not necessarily

    increase the risk of plant water stress (Dayer et al., 2021). For

    instance, the conditions preceding the water stress and the rate at

    which the water stress is imposed will inﬂuence the outcomes

    (Morabito et al., 2022). The age of the plant and the phenological

    stage also play a role. Water stress will hamper cell division and

    elongation, and thus overall growth and reproductive

    development. To cope with the increase in osmotic stress as a

    result of dehydration, cells can accumulate osmoprotectants

    such as sugars and amino acids. Leaf petiole ABA (abscisic

    acid) concentrations are positively correlated with root sucrose

    concentrations in water stressed Grenache and Semillon,

    indicative of integration between ABA signalling and

    carbohydrate metabolism (Rogiers et al., 2011a) during water

    stress conditions. Water stress can also accelerate late ripening

    mesocarp cell death and exacerbate the berry dehydration effect

    in prone cultivars (Fuentes et al., 2010; Bonada et al., 2013b),

    resulting in increased sugar concentration (Sadras and

    McCarthy, 2007; Caravia et al., 2016), altered chemical

    composition (Šuklje et al., 2016) and sensory characteristics

    (Bonada et al., 2013b) of the berry.

    1.3 Bushﬁres

    The risk of ﬁre is predicted to intensify in Australia as a

    result of rising temperature (Williams et al., 2001; Clarke et al.,

    2013; Abram et al., 2021). The ﬁre season will likely increase in

    both duration and intensity resulting in bushﬁres that damage

    vines directly or compromise the crop through smoke exposure

    (Summerson et al., 2021). Smoke exposed fruit resulted in

    undesirable wine aromas with their intensity dependent on the

    phenological stage, characteristics of the ﬁre and environmental

    conditions (Kennison et al., 2007; Krstic et al., 2015). The volatile

    phenols guaiacol, 4-methylguaiacol, o-, m-, and p-cresol; and

    syringol speciﬁcally contributed to the smoky aroma (Jones

    et al., 2022). These volatile phenols enter the fruit through

    their cuticle, with little transport from leaves. Once inside the

    berry, the phenols are glycosylated as a detoxifying mechanism

    (Dungey et al., 2011; Noestheden et al., 2018; Jones et al., 2022).

    Both the free and glycosylated forms have repercussions on

    aroma and ﬂavour (Mayr et al., 2014).

    1.4 Waterlogging

    Heavy rainfall events and ﬂooding are becoming more

    frequent and more intense globally, including Australia

    (Hague, 2021). Flooding as a result of excessive rain may lead

    to plant oxidative stress as a result of hypoxia and/or anoxia. The

    transport of O2 from the leaves to the roots becomes insufﬁcient

    because O2 is consumed enroute, and there is a large resistance

    to gas movement in water saturated root conditions. Moreover,

    soil microorganisms compete with the roots for any remaining

    oxygen (Sauter, 2013). Once hypoxic conditions are perceived, a

    cascade of events led by hypoxic genes are switched on in all the

    plant’s organs (Ruperti et al., 2019). Reduced oxygen levels in the

    roots results in lowered ability for aerobic respiration, however,

    alcoholic fermentation is able to generate limited energy. Toxic

    metabolites and reactive oxygen species (ROS) can accumulate

    under hypoxia or anoxia (Ponnamperuma, 1972). Moreover, the

    translocation of carbohydrates from the reserve sites in the roots

    to the rest of the plant may be hampered or rapidly utilised in

    Rogiers et al.

    10.3389/fpls.2022.1094633

    Frontiers in Plant Science

    frontiersin.org

    03

    situ (Sauter, 2013). Reduced hydraulic conductance as a result of

    insufﬁcient aquaporin activity (Colmer and Greenway, 2011)

    may further result in stomatal closure and consequently wilting.

    Canopy senescence, decreased root growth and root decay may

    also ensue. However, under adequate carbon supplies, new

    adventitious roots can be produced to maintain oxygen

    delivery (Striegler et al., 1993). In general, roots under hypoxic

    conditions are less able to take up water and macronutrients

    (Bailey-Serres and Voesenek, 2010). Soil microorganisms also

    require oxygen and nitrate availability declines as a result of less

    microbiological nitriﬁcation (Nguyen et al., 2018). The

    combined carbohydrate and nutrient starvation may eventually

    result in the death of the vine following ﬂooding-induced

    hypoxia and anoxia.

    1.5 Oxidative stress

    Biotic and abiotic stress such as heat, drought, waterlogging,

    UV-B radiation, nutrient imbalances and salinity can result in the

    overproduction of ROS, leading to oxidative stress. ROS include

    hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide, singlet oxygen, the

    hydroxyl radical and organic and inorganic peroxides. ROS

    propagate chain reactions to target nucleic acids, lipids, proteins

    and other biomolecules causing oxidative damage (Sharma et al.,

    2012). However, depending on the concentration, ROS are also

    secondary messengers for cellular processes, including stress

    responses, and it is the delicate equilibrium between scavenging

    and production that determine their role (Mittler et al., 2022).

    Baseline levels of ROS are produced in most cell compartments,

    including the chloroplast and the mitochondrion in the processes

    of photosynthesis and respiration, and under normal conditions

    cellular homeostasis is maintained. Elevated cellular oxidation

    plays multiple roles in grapevine growth and development. Bud

    burst was suggested to be associated with a localised modulation

    of oxidative signalling within the developing cambium and

    vascular tissues of the enclosed meristem (Meitha et al., 2015).

    The onset of berry ripening is linked to the accumulation of H2O2

    in the skin, in Pinot Noir (Pilati et al., 2014). Under stress

    conditions, ROS production and accumulation is further

    enhanced. For instance, under excessive heat, ROS accrue in the

    cytosol and the nucleus (Babbar et al., 2021). As a result of

    stomatal closure in response to drought, excess radiative energy

    can cause oxidation and hence impair the chloroplast, apoplast

    and cytosol. Because plants are often exposed to several stresses

    simultaneously (e.g. drought, high light and heat), overproduction

    of ROS may result in cell death and tissue necrosis. Cellular

    oxygen sensing (Xiao et al., 2018a; Xiao et al., 2018b), ROS

    detection technology (Chen and Fluhr, 2018) and molecular

    tools, including DNA, RNA and proteins, can be implemented

    to better understand vine response to heat and drought and

    conditions resulting in oxidative stress (Gomès et al., 2021).

    1.6 Earlier maturity and decoupling of

    phenolic from sugar ripeness

    Earlier grape maturity occurring than in the recent past is

    manifesting in many viticulture regions (Duchêne and

    Schneider, 2005; Wolfe et al., 2005; Etien et al., 2009; Duchêne

    et al., 2010; Urhausen et al., 2011; Webb et al., 2011; Morales-

    Castilla et al., 2020). For example, studies found that fruit

    maturity has advanced by 8 days per decade between 1985 and

    2009 in southern Australia (Webb et al., 2011; Webb et al., 2012),

    while another estimated advancement by 0.5 to 3.1 days per year

    over 1993 to 2006 (Petrie and Sadras, 2008). In Chardonnay,

    Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon of south-eastern Australia, the

    early maturity is driven by the early onset of ripening as opposed

    to faster ripening (Sadras and Petrie, 2011). Earlier ripening may

    be driven by temperature, but also by vine water stress as dry

    soils can stimulate the production of the ripening hormone

    ABA. Optimum sugar levels in these warmer seasons are,

    however, not always concomitant with similar maturity in

    colour, ﬂavour or aroma (Kliewer and Torres, 1972; Sadras

    and Moran, 2012; Sadras et al., 2013), culminating in the

    suggestion that ‘sugar ripeness’ is no longer co-ordinated with

    ‘phenolic’ ripeness (Van Leeuwen and Seguin, 2006; Goode,

    2012). In other words, the anthocyanins and tannins have not

    matured to the same extent as they would in cooler years

    characterised by slower sugar accumulation. Berry acidity is

    another important quality parameter likely to decline in

    response to warming (Leolini et al., 2019). Warm nights can

    result in the respiratory loss of malic acid with the effect that the

    sugar-acid and aroma-acid balance is no longer optimal (Gatti

    et al., 2015). However, it has been suggested the trends in earlier

    ripening may not solely be the consequence of climate change,

    considering that better disease management, fertilizer

    application and deliberate yield reductions (to achieve an

    appropriate leaf area to yield ratio) have been implemented

    over the last decades (Webb et al., 2012). Regardless, the shift in

    phenology as a result of climate change demands viticultural

    practices to counteract these negative effects on vine resilience

    and berry attributes. A study of Australian premium wine found

    that quality ratings captured the impact of weather on wine

    prices (Oczkowski, 2016). It was also noted that production

    occurs at seasonal temperatures that are warmer than optimal.

    This is likely to be exacerbated with climate warming and will

    have economic repercussions.

    1.7 Compressed vintages

    A compressed vintage refers to a shorter harvest window for

    one particular cultivar. It also refers to a narrower harvest

    window for several cultivars in one particular region (Sadras

    et al., 2013; Petrie and Sadras, 2016), bringing about competition

    Rogiers et al.

    10.3389/fpls.2022.1094633

    Frontiers in Plant Science

    frontiersin.org

    04

    for labour, harvesting machinery, cooling capacity, winery

    processing equipment and tank space (Sadras et al., 2013). The

    consequence is that harvest compression may result in extended

    ‘hang time’ due to the inability of growers and wineries to

    process large amounts of fruit at once. This extended ripening

    period can lead to overripe fruit with berry shrivelling

    (desiccation), the concentration of existing sugars so that

    alcohol levels rise, loss of acidity and even the degradation of

    anthocyanins as well as altered ﬂavour and aroma proﬁles such

    as a loss of fresh fruit characters (Bonada et al., 2013a; Bonada

    et al., 2013b; Šuklje et al., 2016). Moreover, alcohol levels have

    been rising steadily across many wine regions (Alston et al.,

    2011). In Languedoc, France alcohol increased from 11 to 14%,

    pH increased from 3.5 to 3.75 and total acidity dropped from 6.0

    to 4.5 g/L (Van Leeuwen et al., 2019). Bordeaux wines typically

    were 12.5% in the 1980s but today have risen to 16%. In

    Australia, alcohol concentrations for red wines have increased

    from 12.4% in 1984 to a peak of 14.5% in 2005 (Godden and

    Muhlack, 2010). These high alcohol levels are considered less

    ‘food-friendly’ (Jones, 2010; Jones, 2012), and considering the

    societal issues associated with high alcohol and growing trend

    for healthier lifestyles, consumers are expressing an interest in

    lower alcohol levels (Saliba et al., 2013).

    1.8 Pest and disease pressure

    Shifts in phenology and the geographic distribution of

    grapevine pest insects are taking place as a result of direct and

    indirect effects of climate change (Salinari et al., 2006; Reineke and

    Thiéry, 2016). The spatial and temporal distribution of insects and

    pathogens is largely determined by temperature, light and water

    considering these factors control their growth and development

    (Rosenzweig et al., 2001). These factors also modify the physiology

    and resilience of the grapevine as the host. Drought exacerbates

    underlying issues such as trunk diseases (Eutypa and

    Botryospheria), nematodes and borers while wet conditions are

    conducive to increased disease activity such as powdery and

    downy mildew, Botrytis and other bunch rots (Salinari et al.,

    2006; Steel et al., 2011; Galarneau et al., 2019). Drier conditions

    and reduced leaf wetness may lead to decreased infections;

    however, the accompanying warmer springtime temperatures

    will negate this due to earlier infections (Salinari et al., 2006).

    Because grapevines may become vulnerable to new pathogens as

    they spread geographically, regular monitoring and an adaptive

    environmentally conscious preventative program will be essential.

    1.9 Changing soil properties

    and dynamics

    The physicochemical and biological properties of the soil

    have a strong inﬂuence on soil quality and functionality, and

    these impact on vine physiology and therefore yield and grape

    quality (Cataldo et al., 2021). Soil is a living biological entity with

    multiple functions beyond crop productivity (Doran, 2002; Lal,

    2016). The soil contributes to water, carbon and mineral cycles,

    maintains essential ecosystem functionality by maintaining air

    and water quality, and providing a habitat for biodiversity (Yang

    et al., 2020). Analogous to rising air temperatures, the

    temperature of the soil has increased over the past decades in

    certain regions (Zhang et al., 2005), and high air temperatures

    have been associated with record soil temperatures (Ooi et al.,

    2009). To what extent cover crops ameliorate the relationship

    between air and soil temperature need investigation. However,

    soil temperature is an important driver for microbial activity

    (Bradford et al., 2019), carbon sequestration/release (Huang

    et al., 2018), greenhouse gas emissions (Smith et al., 2018),

    and below- and above-ground growth (Rogiers et al., 2014).

    Warmer soils can initiate earlier budbreak (Rogiers et al., 2014)

    and this may increase susceptibility of vine shoot growth to late-

    spring frosts.

    The increasing variability in the quantity, intensity of rain

    and other extreme weather events also inﬂuence soil health

    (Allen et al., 2011). The physical loss of soil through

    mechanical cultivation and displacement through erosion is

    likely to be exacerbated by heavy rains. Prolonged drought will

    impact on water inﬁltration, soil organic matter and carbon

    sequestration. Additionally, low soil moisture decreases N

    availability in the upper soil horizons (Curtin et al., 2012). N

    is important to overall growth and berry composition such as

    aromatic secondary metabolites as well as yeast assimilable

    nitrogen (YAN) for fermentation. Drought will also inﬂuence

    the species and quantity of functional micro-organisms present

    because water acts as a resource, solvent and transport medium

    (Schimel, 2018). Aside from the soil itself, the composition and

    quantity of root exudates are affected by environmental

    parameters such as temperature and water, and these interact

    with the root microbiome to inﬂuence nutrient cycling, organic

    matter decomposition and plant growth regulation (Yang

    et al., 2020).

    2 Intervention strategies

    Without intervention, the combination of these stresses may

    lead to greater yield variability, sub-optimal berry composition

    and inconsistency in wine style and typicity. Aside from

    accessing cooler regions, these approaches could include:

    alternative cultivars and rootstocks, efﬁcient irrigation

    strategies, delayed pruning, and consideration of row

    orientation, training systems along with canopy manipulation,

    plant tissue ﬁlms, sustainable vineyard ﬂoor management and

    sequential harvesting (Figure 1). These strategies will need to be

    vineyard speciﬁc to match the topography, environmental

    conditions, cultivar, and style of wine desired, and it is likely

    Rogiers et al.

    10.3389/fpls.2022.1094633

    Frontiers in Plant Science

    frontiersin.org

    05

    that a changing combination will be required depending on the

    urgency of immediate threats versus addressing longer term

    sustainability. Additionally, grower, community and consumer

    values/pressures will need to be considered along with labour

    availability and other socio-economic factors. Most importantly,

    any adaptation measure should consider potential short- and

    long- term impacts on the environment. Sustainable

    productivity will require a balanced approach with

    environmental stewardship and the preservation of our

    resources for future generations (Doran, 2002).

    2.1 Accessing cooler sites

    Suitability maps based on bioclimatic indices have been

    developed for future climate scenarios. Of the 61 wine regions

    in Australia, it is expected that quality wine grape production

    will be affected in 21 regions by 2070 if appropriate adaptations

    are not implemented (Hall and Jones, 2009). The investment

    into cooler regions is already apparent, particularly in Tasmania

    where wine production is increasing by 10% each year.

    Moving vineyards to cooler elevations is another likely

    scenario. Higher altitudes have lower night temperatures,

    potentially resulting in higher acidity and aroma in grape

    berries with lower alcohol in the wine (Van Leeuwen and

    Senguin, 2006). Delayed budbreak and bloom are also

    characteristic of the lower temperatures at increased elevations

    (Falcão et al., 2010). Vineyards that are currently located on sun-

    exposed slopes, may spread into sites that traditionally avoided

    because these sites were low in temperature. The particular ﬁne-

    scale conditions including aspect, slope, wind exposure, soil

    drainage and proximity to water bodies will impact on

    suitability of a site, but often are not captured with

    macroclimatic modelling (Mosedale et al., 2016; Pipan et al.,

    2021). Regardless, shifts in location will entail high economic,

    environmental and social cost. Extension of vineyards into more

    marginal sites maybe at the expense of loss of natural habitats,

    impacting on biodiversity and natural water supplies.

    2.2 Alternative cultivars, clones

    and rootstocks

    Viticulture has the availability of hundreds of cultivars well

    suited to a wide range of climates, extending from cool,

    intermediate, warm to hot conditions (Jones, 2006). The

    conservation of current viticultural regions is possible by

    exploiting this diverse plant material. Finding the right cultivar

    or clone for a speciﬁc location is complex, however, and is

    dependent on the cultivar/clone’s climate niche and the

    distinctive wine style that is desired. Any one cultivar can

    produce quite different wine styles, with cooler climates

    resulting in lighter, fresher and crisper styles of higher acidity

    while warmer climates result in wines with more body, colour,

    higher alcohol and darker fruit characters. Growing a cultivar

    outside its climatic niche may decrease certainty in consistent

    productivity, quality as well as wine style. High quality Pinot

    Noir, for example, has a particularly narrow range of optimal

    average growing season temperature, at 14-16°C (Jones et al.,

    2005) and its future suitability to a particular location could be in

    doubt (Jones and Webb, 2010). A greater effort to match the

    climate to many of the lesser-known cultivars will greatly

    enhance the adoption of these cultivars in a changing climate.

    The allocation of speciﬁc rootstocks that are able to shift

    FIGURE 1

    Summary of emerging challenges related to climate change and potential practical
    intervention strategies for the viticulture industry to consider.

    10.3389/fpls.2022.1094633

    Frontiers in Plant Science

    frontiersin.org

    06

    phenology and ripening rates (Van Leeuwen and Destrac-Irvine,

    2017) will also be valuable but will require site speciﬁc research

    in line with cultivar credentials.

    Drought tolerant cultivars may be considered for the future

    when water is scarce or too expensive. Likewise, late ripening

    cultivars may be required to address the expected advance of

    phenology (Duchêne et al., 2010). Choosing a cultivar to plant in

    a new vineyard today, knowing that it will experience a different

    climate in 20-30 years, is challenging and is also confounded

    with changing consumer preferences. Shiraz might be the iconic

    Australian wine for some time yet, but there is scope to bring in

    lesser-known cultivars or even newly bred cultivars that are

    better able to cope with climate change. To spread the risk, some

    winegrowers are adopting to plant several cultivars and/or

    rootstocks within a speciﬁc location.

    Cultivars from countries such as Italy, are currently being

    planted in regions across Australia and their growth,

    productivity and wine production potential are being evaluated

    (Chalmers, 2019). In particular, the cultivar’s distinctive

    character is assessed along with consumer preference studies

    to better gauge its potential for premium wine production. The

    breeding of cultivars suited to hot climates from additional

    ongoing research has yielded interesting cultivars, producing

    wines with, for example, increased colour intensity that may be

    used on their own or for blending purposes (Dry et al., 2022).

    Speciﬁcally, disease resistant cultivars bred by CSIRO have been

    evaluated across both cool and warm growing regions with good

    performance. Second generation mildew-resistant cultivars is the

    current focus of the breeding programs and the microvine, a

    dwarf grapevine mutant that ﬂowers continuously (Dry and

    Thomas, 2015), will speed up the process considerably.

    Aside from climate, soil is an important component of the

    vine’s natural environment and the roots interact directly with

    the abiotic and biotic characteristics of the soil proﬁle along a

    range of depths. Rootstocks offer resistance to phylloxera,

    nematodes and fungal pathogens but they also have varying

    tolerance to abiotic stresses (Marı́n et al., 2021). Vines with

    deeper and more extensive root systems are better able to access

    available underground water, while others have a greater

    intrinsic capacity to absorb water as a result of their higher

    ﬁne root hydraulic conductivity and aquaporin activity

    (Gambetta et al., 2012). Rootstocks that are able to control

    vigour, or inﬂuence stomatal conductance through chemical or

    hydraulic signalling, can reduce vine transpiration and maintain

    plant water status. Drought tolerant rootstocks such as Ramsey,

    110 Richter, the new generation M-series rootstocks, and salt-

    exclusion rootstocks such as 140 Ruggeri and 1103 Paulsen have

    been adopted to help vines cope with drought and soil salinity

    (Stevens and Walker, 2002; Pitt et al., 2018; Bianchi et al., 2020).

    Soil salinity has increased due to irrigation, of concern in the

    Murray River Valley of Australia, as high salinity impacts

    severely on growth and productivity. To improve tolerance to

    ﬂooding, grafting onto Couderc 3309 resulted in less adverse

    impacts (Striegler et al., 1993). Rootstocks can also inﬂuence

    phenology and ripening (May, 1994; Walker et al., 2000).

    Breeding programs can target rootstocks that shift berry

    ripening into a lower temperature period enabling berry

    anthocyanin and acidity to be maintained. Trials have been

    implemented to assess rootstocks for their ability to reduce

    potassium uptake by vines and berries (Ollat et al., 2015;

    Walker and Clingeleffer, 2016; Xiao et al., 2020) considering

    that grape juice pH is correlated with juice potassium and high

    pH has negative consequences for ﬂavour, wine stability and

    colour (Rogiers et al., 2017).

    2.3 Irrigation

    Increases in evaporative demand and declines in

    precipitation as a consequence of climate change result

    in greater irrigation requirements for the vineyard. However,

    in Australia, it is expected that the quantity and quality of water

    available for irrigation will be reduced (Murray-Darling Basin

    Authority 2010). Drawing water from surface and groundwater

    sources has impacts on the surrounding natural environment

    as well as other agricultural industries and thus more judicious

    use of this precious resource is at the forefront of vineyard

    managers. The conversion from ﬂood to drip irrigation in

    Australian grape growing regions has resulted in enormous

    water savings, and despite the additional energy required to

    run water pumps, the precision offered by drip irrigation has

    allowed the implementation of various mild deﬁcit strategies to

    inﬂuence yield, berry composition and wine properties

    (Edwards and Clingeleffer, 2013). Regulated deﬁcit irrigation

    (RDI) is another strategy used to limit competition between

    vegetative and reproductive growth in red cultivars and is

    usually applied between fruit set and veraison. While RDI

    and prolonged deﬁcit reduced yield in Cabernet Sauvignon

    grown in a warm climate, there was no progressive reduction in

    yield over multiple seasons (Edwards and Clingeleffer, 2013).

    However, deﬁcit irrigation in combination with elevated

    temperatures were detrimental to Shiraz wine phenolic

    substances and sensory traits (Bonada et al., 2015). Applying

    a water deﬁcit prior to véraison may offset the delay in

    anthocyanin accumulation that can occur during high

    temperatures later in the season (Sadras and Moran, 2012).

    Investment in soil moisture sensors and methods to monitor

    vine water status will ensure that critical thresholds are not

    surpassed in managing the vineyard.

    From the perspective of balancing canopy management and

    water-use efﬁciency, even though water savings are generally

    beneﬁcial, if canopy development is impaired and bunch over-

    exposure occurs then it is suggested that sufﬁcient water should

    be applied early in the season to allow full canopy development.

    The cooler microclimate because of the shading will lessen the

    severity of berry sunburn and shrivelling during late ripening.

    Rogiers et al.

    10.3389/fpls.2022.1094633

    Frontiers in Plant Science

    frontiersin.org

    07

    Hypoxia and cell death in the berries can also occur during the

    late ripening stage in some cultivars (Xiao et al., 2018b), and this

    is exacerbated by water stress (Bonada et al., 2013b; Bonada

    et al., 2015; Xiao et al., 2018a).

    The loss of berry cell vitality was characterised using the cell

    vitality dye (Krasnow et al., 2008; Tilbrook and Tyerman, 2008;

    Fuentes et al., 2010), which was associated with the reduced

    electrical impedance of the berries (Caravia et al., 2015). The cell

    death inhibitor gene VvBAP1 was associated with increased

    drought tolerance (Cao et al., 2019). Shiraz is a variety

    associated with severe hypoxia and cell death in berries (Xiao

    et al., 2018b), increased hydraulic resistance into the berry after

    véraison (Tilbrook and Tyerman, 2008), as well as greater

    propensity for backﬂow of water from the berry to the vine in

    the later stage of ripening (Tilbrook and Tyerman, 2009). Due to

    greater severity of hypoxia and a decline in respiration, the

    energy status of berries may be curtailed in the late ripening

    stages. These changes in berry energy status might be correlated

    with altered metabolism and the greater force to transport

    solutes into and within the berries. The hydraulic and energy

    status of the berries, and the vitality of berry cells, may provide

    more insight into berry ripening, potentially informing future

    irrigation and fertilisation strategies.

    Practical safeguard measures to deal with drought include

    the use of polymers or physical covers to reduce evaporation

    from storage dams, prioritising high value blocks when water is

    limited. Monitoring water demand through soil or plant-based

    sensors in combination with weather data, will ensure

    sustainable water use and potentially water savings for

    heatwave events. Ensuring dripper spacing is frequent enough

    to prevent alternating wet and dry zones will allow consistent

    root growth to spread across a wide area.

    2.3.1 Irrigation during heatwaves

    Irrigation is recommended prior to an impending heatwave

    to ensure that the optimal ﬁeld capacity is maintained (Webb

    et al., 2010). Relative to the local climate and historical

    observations, a three-day period of unusual high maximum

    and minimum temperatures can be classiﬁed as a heatwave

    event (Nairn and Fawcett, 2015). During the heatwave, the vines

    should continue to be watered at regular intervals ensuring that

    transpiration is maintained to cool the canopy and bunches

    (Hayman et al., 2012). Application of water directly to the

    canopy is discussed below in 2.6 under hydro-cooling. The

    timing of the heatwave during the growing season will result

    in different consequences, with earlier heatwaves lowering fruit

    set and later heatwaves disrupting ripening. Heatwaves can cause

    vines to ‘shut down’; that is, photosynthesis stops, due to

    stomatal closure, so that water can be conserved, and thus the

    rate of ripening slows (Greer and Weedon, 2013). Depending on

    the timing, severity and duration of the heatwave, it may take

    several weeks for the vine to resume its normal photosynthetic

    activity resulting in overall low-quality fruit. In contrast, it has

    been suggested that dry soils brought about by higher

    temperatures and drought may advance grape maturity (Webb

    et al., 2012) associated with ABA production by the roots

    (Davies et al., 2000), a hormone correlated with ripening

    (Wheeler et al., 2009). Moreover, dry soils ﬂuctuate in

    temperature to a greater extent during the day hence vine

    roots may experience warmer temperatures (Rogiers et al.,

    2014) when the soils are dry.

    2.3.2 Post-harvest irrigation

    Post-harvest irrigation has the beneﬁt of prolonging leaf

    photosynthesis if conditions are warm enough so that vine

    carbohydrates can be replenished (Loescher et al., 1990).

    Grapevines rely on the stored reserves during early season

    root, shoot and inﬂorescence growth and a long post-harvest

    period with adequate soil moisture allows carbon capture

    through photosynthesis and may even encourage a new ﬂush

    of ﬁne root growth to aid in the uptake of nutrients (Mahmud,

    2016). The timing of leaf senescence to some extent determines

    the length of carbohydrate reserve accumulation during the

    post-harvest period and this can be considerable in warm-

    climate viticulture.

    2.3.3 Dry winters

    Rainfall has been declining in late autumn and early winter

    in south-eastern Australia (Cai and Cowan, 2013) and may have

    negative impacts during budburst and spring canopy

    development. A recent study investigated the effects of low

    winter rainfall on vine growth and wine quality using rainout

    shelters (Bonada et al., 2017). Vines were irrigated with micro-

    sprinklers or drippers at different timepoints during the winter

    and it was evident that waiting to reﬁll the proﬁle until budburst

    resulted in excessive vegetative growth with negative

    consequences on yield and wine composition. It is likely that

    root growth dynamics and root longevity is altered by the

    changes in precipitation and irrigation patterns and this will

    have consequences on overall vine performance. Bonada et al.

    (2017) recommended that the soil proﬁle be maintained

    throughout winter rather than delaying until spring to irrigate

    and reﬁll the soil proﬁle.

    2.4 Delayed pruning

    Delayed maturation of the berries into the cooler period of

    the growing season and decompressing the harvest window can

    be encouraged by delayed pruning. Applying pruning after

    budburst can delay véraison, allowing ripening to occur during

    cooler months. Pruning carried out at the 10 cm shoot length

    stage, following mechanical winter spur pruning, achieved a

    reduction in sugar accumulation in Sangiovese berries (Palliotti

    Rogiers et al.

    10.3389/fpls.2022.1094633

    Frontiers in Plant Science

    frontiersin.org

    08

    et al., 2017). Shiraz berries from vines pruned at the 2-3 leaf stage

    reached sugar ripeness up to two weeks later than those with

    winter pruning applied and attained an improved anthocyanin

    to sugar ratio (Moran et al., 2017). This strategy was favourable

    for balancing tannin accumulation, colour intensity, fruit aroma

    and ﬂavours (Moran et al., 2018).

    In addition, delayed pruning can minimize the risk of spring

    frost damage of the young spring shoots (Friend and Trought,

    2007) and improve pollination and fertilisation, by inducing

    ﬂowering to occur in warmer months. Delayed spur-pruning of

    the previous season’s apical nodes inhibits the development of

    basal nodes through apical dominance. Pruning carried out three

    months later than the usual winter pruning time increased yield

    by 60 to 90%, in Merlot, over a three-season trial (Petrie et al.,

    2017). However, the impact of delayed pruning on yield was

    considered to be dependent on interrelated factors such as

    cultivar, seasonal conditions as well as timing and severity of

    the pruning applied. Hence further development and assessment

    of this strategy is needed.

    2.5 Row orientation, training systems and

    canopy manipulation

    2.5.1 Vine balance

    Balancing yield with new biomass growth is critical to

    maintaining long-term sustainable productivity. Nutrient and

    carbohydrate reserves are essential for supporting early spring

    growth prior to ﬂowering and are subsequently reﬁlled within

    the vine prior to ripening (Rogiers et al., 2011b). Heat and

    drought can inﬂuence the quantity of the photoassimilate that is

    ﬁxed and then distributed to the three growing sinks (roots,

    shoots and bunches), as well as the reserve pool, predominantly

    sequestered as starch in the vine structural root system (Rogiers

    et al., 2011a).

    Vine balance can be achieved by pruning of the dormant

    vines and thinning of the growing leaves/shoots. The number of

    nodes to be retained during winter pruning can affect vigour,

    yield, fruit composition and long-term productivity of the vines.

    Factors such as cultivar, climate and other management

    inﬂuences should be considered when determining the number

    of nodes retained. Keeping long-term records on yield and

    pruning weight will aid in monitoring vine performance for

    reliable vine balance assessment and crop load calculation. Leaf

    removal and shoot thinning can inﬂuence ripening of the fruit to

    varying degrees, depending on the cultivar, growing conditions,

    timing and severity of the thinning applied (De Bei et al., 2019).

    Excessive leaf removal around the bunch zone may result in

    sunburn of berries. Likewise, shoot thinning of Semillon at the 8-

    9 leaf stage in a hot Australian climate did not alter berry

    composition, probably because vine balance was not altered

    (De Bei et al., 2020). Further research on thinning techniques

    is required to assess the sustainable effects of this strategy.

    2.5.2 Natural shading

    The geometry of the canopy can be manipulated to ensure

    that the microclimate of the bunch zone is well-suited to the

    development of desirable berry attributes. Adequate solar

    radiation is required for optimal photosynthesis, bud fertility,

    and berry development, including polyphenol accumulation

    (Berli et al., 2008). However, over-exposure of leaves may

    result in photo-inhibition of photosynthesis (Greer et al.,

    1986) and leaf necrosis and mortality. Sunburnt fruit leads to

    increased bitterness with browning of the wine, and damaged

    skin can lead to pathogen invasion. Dark cultivars can

    experience berry temperature 15°C higher than ambient

    temperature and thus alterations in the primary and secondary

    metabolites important to wine quality are likely (Bergqvist et al.,

    2001). The excessive exposure of leaves and fruit to direct

    incoming and reﬂected radiation can be addressed by row

    orientation, vine architecture, planting density and canopy

    management. The hot afternoon sun can be avoided by

    orientating rows in the east-west direction as opposed to the

    north-south direction (Buesa et al., 2020). Allowing canopies to

    sprawl so that fruit are shaded will minimise sunburn and

    shrivelling in hot, sunny climates. While the natural shading

    may decrease air circulation and increase disease pressure, this

    may not be an issue in dry regions. Because light is important to

    anthocyanin production, shading may decrease colour in the red

    cultivars hence the balance between temperature and light will

    need to be considered. Removal of the leaves above the

    bunchzone of cvs. Bobal and Tempranillo vines prior to

    veraison, and grown under mild water stress, limited the

    accumulation of anthocyanins more than total soluble solids

    and was thus not recommended as a method to delay harvest

    (Buesa et al., 2018). Similarly, avoiding shoot trimming or leaf

    removal will decrease sun damage and also save on labour costs.

    Vertical Shoot Positioning (VSP) is not recommended in hot,

    dry conditions and when sun damage is an issue. Foliage wires

    can, however, be used to minimise canopy displacement caused

    by wind.

    Pergola type systems that allow the spread of leaves above

    the hanging fruit are ideal for providing shade, and ventilation

    simultaneously. In contrast, the Gobelet, also known as the bush

    vine, is an ancient architectural system still used in the dry

    regions of Spain with reduced leaf area (Van Leeuwen et al.,

    2019). It, however, has the drawback of low productivity and is

    not conducive to mechanical harvesting. The bush vine tends to

    have a short trunk, however, trunk height can be manipulated to

    raise bunches away from the soil surface where temperatures

    may be warmer (Van Leeuwen et al., 2019)

    2.6 Shade structures and hydro-cooling

    The interactive effect of temperature and photon ﬂux

    densities on reproductive development in Shiraz vines was

    Rogiers et al.

    10.3389/fpls.2022.1094633

    Frontiers in Plant Science

    frontiersin.org

    09

    assessed in response to several densities of shade cloth over three

    seasons (Abeysinghe et al., 2018). During severe heat events the

    50% shade treatments were able to reduce canopy temperatures

    signiﬁcantly, by approximately 4-5°C. While berry growth was

    delayed by a 50% shade cover, maximum berry size and the rate

    of sugar accumulation was not affected. It was interesting to note

    that shade cover up to 50% had no impact on the ripening

    process when there were no heat events. The berries had lower

    sugar concentrations due to greater water content and cell

    vitality was maintained, but most notably the wines from the

    fruit resulted in lower alcohol without reduced anthocyanin

    concentrations. Alongside density, the net’s colour has an

    important impact on the spectral wavelengths that the canopy

    and fruit are exposed to, thus impacting on vegetative growth

    and reproductive development, including fruit composition

    (González et al., 2015).

    Overhead sprinklers and misting may reduce heat and water

    stress as they are able to cool both canopies and berries. Semillon

    is a cultivar that is particularly sensitive to heat stress both

    during ﬂowering and ripening, with reduced photosynthesis due

    to both stomatal and nonstomatal limitations and requiring up

    to 2 weeks to recover (Greer and Weston, 2010; Greer and

    Weedon, 2013). Hydrocooling, activated at a threshold

    temperature of 35°C, extended the period for leaf and berry

    expansion so that berries were larger. Canopy temperatures were

    lower, net CO2 assimilation was higher and berry TSS was also

    slightly elevated (Greer and Weedon, 2014)

    The cost and availability of water for hydrocooling may be

    an issue and adequate planning so that enough water is available

    for the entire season is required. The increase in disease pressure

    is likely to be low in heatwave conditions, but if conditions are

    warm and humid for a protracted period this may become an

    issue. The water quality should be adequate as saline water will

    result in leaf burn and defoliation.

    2.7 Antitranspirants, sunscreens and ﬁlm-

    forming barriers

    Plant tissue ﬁlms have been available to viticulture for

    several decades and have been trialled for their capacity to

    maintain tissue hydration (e.g. di-1-p-menthene: Palliotti et al.,

    2013; Gatti et al., 2016; Rogiers and Fahey, 2019), prevent

    sunburn (e.g. kaolin: Dinis et al., 2016; Conde et al., 2016;

    Conde et al., 2018), decrease disease incidence (e.g. chitosan:

    Meng et al., 2008) or even to ameliorate smoke taint (e.g. kaolin:

    Van der Hulst et al., 2019). These ﬁlms are derived from natural

    or synthetic origins and, depending on their composition, time

    of application and concentration, may or may not be beneﬁcial.

    When compared to protective netting, these particle ﬁlm-

    forming and antitranspirant products may reduce fruit quality

    and consumer acceptance (Brillante et al., 2016). In a smoke

    taint study, several materials were tested for their ability to

    prevent absorption of gaseous phenols but it was noted that they

    did not provide much protection (Culbert et al., 2021).

    2.8 Sustainable vineyard

    ﬂoor management

    2.8.1 Inter-row and under-row vegetation

    Bare soil as a result of cultivation contributes signiﬁcantly to

    vineyard heating, water and carbon loss, soil erosion and

    greenhouse gas emissions (Santos et al., 2020). Allowing the

    resident vegetation to grow or planting cover crops can improve

    water inﬁltration, soil organic matter and microbial function

    (Celette et al., 2008; Steenwerth and Belina, 2008). Inter-row and

    under-row vegetation can encourage soil biodiversity and lessen

    disease pressure (Garcia et al., 2018). To minimise the

    competition for water between the vines and the inter-row

    plants they can be slashed or allowed to dry (Webb et al.,

    2010). Moreover, planting native species alongside a vineyard

    has the beneﬁts of reducing wind, salinity, erosion and providing

    ecosystem services (Viers et al., 2013).

    In regions with adequate rainfall, legume cover crops can

    supply soil organic matter and biologically ﬁxed N to the

    grapevine (Ball et al., 2020). Nitrogen application to soil in the

    form of synthetic fertilisers, manures, composts or mulches can

    lead to nitrous oxide emissions, a particularly potent greenhouse

    gas (Longbottom and Petrie, 2015). Targeting the application of

    N during the phase of active nutrient uptake (before ﬂowering

    and after harvest when there is a long post-harvest period) will

    reduce excessive N in the soil and curb nitrous oxide emissions.

    Employing drip irrigation instead of furrow or ﬂood irrigation

    will also curb emissions as microbial activity leading to

    denitriﬁcation is reduced (Suddick et al., 2011).

    2.8.2 Mulches, composts and soil conditioners

    Undervine mulch, such as straw or vineyard prunings, has

    many beneﬁts, aside from weed control, including the

    amelioration of soil water evaporation (López-Urrea et al.,

    2020), the regulation of soil temperature and improving

    biodiversity. Improving the carbon content of the soil by

    adding mulch and composts not only offsets carbon

    emissions but also improves soil structure and the water

    holding capacity of the soil. Likewise, composts increase

    nutrient reserves, the cation exchange capacity, and reduce

    the requirement for synthetic fertilisers. Organic matter

    supports soil biodiversity, which in turn suppresses

    pathogens and promotes beneﬁcial as opposed to parasitic

    organisms. Figure 2 provides an overview of factors driving

    soil health and indicators for soil health assessment. Microbes

    are especially beneﬁcial at the recycling of nutrients from

    organic matter and minerals. Mulches applied on top of the

    Rogiers et al.

    10.3389/fpls.2022.1094633

    Frontiers in Plant Science

    frontiersin.org

    10

    manure or compost further reduces the release of nutrients

    such as nitrogen to the atmosphere and also helps control root-

    zone temperature. The characteristics of the soil amendment

    including its pH, EC, nutrient and heavy metal content should

    be considered prior to application. Composted grape marc, for

    instance, contains potassium and this has the potential to

    increase the pH of the grape must so that acid additions are

    required in the winery (Rogiers et al., 2017). That said, the

    addition of grape marc to soil in New Zealand had minor

    effects on juice K and pH (Mundy and Agnew, 2002).

    Organic amendments such as biochar and brown coal

    waste (BCW) are a source of soil organic matter, which can

    inﬂuence the soil microclimate, microbial community

    structure, biomass turnover and mineralisation of nutrients

    (Amoah-Antwi et al., 2020). Coal derived humate is potentially

    effective as a soil conditioner in improving aggregate stability

    of acidic and sodic soils against adverse effects of cyclic

    seasonal wetting and drying conditions (Imbufe et al., 2005).

    Biochar is a carbon-rich material produced by heating organic

    material through the pyrolysis process in an oxygen limited

    environment. Feedstock and pyrolysis conditions

    (temperature, heating rate, oxygen supply, pressure, residence

    time, cooling down procedure) can result in biochars with

    differing chemical and physical properties (Fryda and Visser,

    2015). Therefore, they are heterogeneous materials with a

    diverse range of properties that change over time. Biochar

    may improve soil function, increase nutrient availability to

    plants, promote plant productivity, remediate organic/

    inorganic contaminants, reduce N2O emissions, increase soil

    pH and lead to the net removal of carbon from the atmosphere

    (Laird, 2008; Kolton et al., 2017). Biochar’s macropores ﬁlled

    with adsorbed nutrients create a habitat for beneﬁcial

    microorganisms (Atkinson et al., 2010). Biochar can provide

    protection against both root and foliar plant diseases through

    the direct manipulation of bacterial communities or by induced

    plant resilience (Elad et al., 2011). In vineyards, biochar may

    increase soil fertility, productivity or both (Baronti et al., 2014;

    Schmidt et al., 2014; Genesio et al., 2015; Mackie et al., 2015;

    Giagnoni et al., 2019; Garcı́a-Jaramillo et al., 2021). Notably, a

    long-term study over ten years showed evidence of increases in

    soil water content and plant water status (Baronti et al., 2022).

    However further research is required using different parent

    materials and pyrolysis conditions to gain a better

    understanding of the potential for improving plant resilience

    and maintaining fruit quality under climate change.

    2.9 Biostimulants

    Application of biostimulants to grapevines have a high

    potential for promoting nutrient uptake, tolerance to biotic

    and abiotic stress and improving fruit yield and quality

    (Monteiro et al., 2022). Biostimulants are deﬁned as “any

    substance or microorganism applied to plants with the aim to

    enhance nutrition efﬁciency, abiotic stress tolerance and/or crop

    quality traits, regardless of its nutrients content” (Du Jardin,

    2015). Biostimulants commonly used in vineyards include

    seaweed extracts, humic substances, chitosan, exudates, and

    other plant extracts (Cataldo et al., 2022). Seaweed extracts

    contain macro- and micro-nutrients, amino acids, vitamins,

    auxins, abscisic acid and cytokinins. Likewise, brown sea

    weeds (Ascophyllum nodosum L.) have been shown to improve

    tolerance against biotic and abiotic stresses (Salvi et al., 2019;

    Taskos et al., 2019).

    2.10 Sequential harvesting

    Wine alcohol can be reduced through the simple method of

    adding water to the juice and amendments to the Australia New

    Zealand Food Standards Code now allows limited addition of

    water to high sugar must above 24.3°Brix. Alternatively, alcohol

    can be removed from wine using vacuum distillation or

    membrane systems based on reverse osmosis and evaporative

    perstraction, however the methods are not eco-sustainable and

    these wines tend to lack aroma through the loss of desirable

    volatile compounds responsible for fruity and ﬂoral characters

    (Longo et al., 2018). Other strategies include the use of yeast

    strains tailored for lower ethanol yields (Ristic et al., 2016;

    Hranilovic et al., 2020). Grapes harvested at a lower sugar

    level may have insufﬁcient phenolic and aroma attributes that

    are characteristic of more mature fruit, and they may have too

    much acid and an undesirable herbaceous character. This can

    potentially be overcome by blending a low and high alcoholic

    wine so that acid levels are balanced and ripe ﬂavours mask the

    unripe attributes. Following two sequential harvests, blending

    wines made from less ripe grapes with wine viniﬁed from riper

    fruit resulted in a wine with similar sensory proﬁles of the later

    harvested fruit but with a lower alcohol content (Longo et al.,

    2018). This particular investigation was conducted on Petit

    Verdot and Verdelho, but the positive outcome certainly

    warrants further studies on other cultivars.

    2.11 Technology, sensors, AI and

    online tools

    Information on vineyard status can be obtained through

    sensors placed in contact with the soil or plant. For instance, soil

    nutrients can be assessed using ion-selective electrodes and ion-

    sensitive ﬁeld-effect transistors (Adamchuck and Rossel, 2010).

    Direct measurement of plant water status for irrigation

    scheduling is more accurate than soil moisture monitoring

    alone as sensor placement may not be representative of full

    ﬁeld conditions; moreover, plant measurement integrates

    evaporative demand. The most accurate method for assessing

    plant water potential is the pressure chamber, however this

    method is not conducive to automation. Dendrometers

    (Clonch et al., 2021), sap ﬂow (Mancha et al., 2021), and

    acoustic sensors (Oletic et al., 2020) provide information on

    plant water status, and if temperature sensitivity, set-up

    inaccuracies and data interpretation difﬁculties can be

    overcome, these tools may be useful when correctly calibrated.

    Additionally, climate sensors alongside leaf temperature and

    wetness sensors provide continuous data on pest and disease

    pressure. These data can be captured using wireless sensor

    network (WSN) technologies that allow the real-time remote

    monitoring of several areas within the vineyard.

    While contact sensors have their place in vineyard

    management, contactless sensors are the new focus of the

    viticulture industry. Satellite imagery allows monitoring at a

    large scale however is limited by satellite orbit coverage patterns,

    visiting times, clouds and spectral resolution. Remote sensing

    using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or ground vehicles

    equipped with GPS and an array of sensors is capable of the

    collection of high-resolution data (mm) on phenology, water

    status, vigour, pest and disease incidence, weeds, yield and

    maturity (Seng et al., 2018; Maes and Steppe, 2019; Sassu

    et al., 2021). Thermal (Far-IR), RGB (red, green, blue),

    multispectral, hyperspectral sensors and chlorophyll

    ﬂuorescence systems have all been applied to assess plant

    status and reproductive parameters (Matese et al., 2015;

    Tardaguila et al., 2021). Light detection and ranging (LiDAR)

    is appropriate for the determination of leaf area index and can be

    used to assess dieback as a result of trunk diseases (Ouyang et al.,

    2021). Hyperspectral and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy have

    been useful for the assessment of real-time berry composition

    during ripening (González-Caballero et al., 2012; Power et al.,

    2019). Additionally, both thermal imaging and NIR

    spectroscopy have been developed for real-time plant water

    status assessment (De Bei et al., 2011; Diago et al., 2018), with

    automated variable drip irrigation to address low-performing

    areas within a vineyard on the radar. Thus, high-resolution

    monitoring allows for management that takes into consideration

    the natural variability in the block (Fuentes and Gago, 2022).

    One of the greatest challenges that remains is the processing

    and integration of the large data sets acquired by these

    monitoring technologies (Manfreda et al., 2018), allowing a

    targeted management plan to be effected. AI and machine

    learning (ML) models are able to overcome these limitations

    and have been rapidly advancing in viticulture (Seng et al., 2018;

    Fuentes and Gago, 2022). These approaches can result in

    intelligent recommendations for efﬁcient water, pesticide and

    nutrient use not only to target yield and composition but also to

    deal with temporal and spatial variability. Moreover, robotic

    innovations are currently under development for the

    monitoring, pruning, spraying and weeding of vineyards

    (Matese et al., 2015). Thus, these technologies allow for

    targeted treatment with improvements in efﬁciency and

    reductions in environmental repercussions.

    The widespread use of smartphones and apps allow growers

    rapid and cost-effective assessments of individual vines within

    the vineyard. A smartphone with an attached thermal camera

    showed promise for assessing vine water status and to aid in

    irrigation scheduling (Petrie et al., 2019). Canopy vigour

    assessment through the VitiCanopy® app has GPS capabilities

    Rogiers et al.

    10.3389/fpls.2022.1094633

    Frontiers in Plant Science

    frontiersin.org

    12

    making it appropriate to map spatial canopy architecture (De

    Bei et al., 2016), and early prediction of yield is possible at

    ﬂowering (Aquino et al., 2015) and berry (Liu et al., 2020)

    quantiﬁcation. ML has also been applied for the detection of

    smoke contamination in berries using NIR spectroscopy

    (Fuentes and Tongson, 2018; Summerson et al., 2021).

    Furthermore, computer vision and deep learning were applied

    for the detection of nutrient disorders in grapevines (Debnath

    et al., 2021). RGB images of nutrient deﬁciencies were taken as

    symptoms progressed and these were used to develop, train and

    test models for the incorporation onto a smartphone. Flexible

    and rapid adjustment to the challenges posed by variable

    weather patterns can now be addressed through timely online

    notiﬁcation systems, including SMS messages to a phone. There

    has been signiﬁcant investment in the forecasting of heatwaves

    and communication to growers so that they are able to prepare

    for such events. For maximum adoption, technical solutions

    need to be simple, rapid, affordable, accurate, precise and

    integrated with other data gathering platforms (Figure 3).

    3 Summary

    The Australian wine industry is already implementing site-

    speciﬁc adaptive measures to deal with unpredictable weather,

    droughts and rising temperatures. Growers are conscious of

    their environmental footprint, their long-term sustainability,

    and are balancing these visions with economic viability

    (Figure 4). The increasing awareness of sustainable

    management practises will result in overall improvements in

    environmental equilibrium and soil health for future

    generations. As they become more economical and user-

    friendly, technical innovations will be readily adopted and

    integrated with more traditional approaches to vineyard

    management. However, long-term ﬁeld trials are required to

    ﬁne-tune these adaptive strategies to particular situations.

    Additionally, the inclusion of stakeholders in a co-design

    framework for future R&D will accelerate the adoption of

    these mitigation strategies.

    Abstract Unmanned aerial system (UAS)-based sensing technologies are considered
    an invaluable component of digital agriculture through delivery of timely and
    accurate information that can contribute to food and water security and sustainable
    food production. Precision agriculture, which focuses on optimization procedures
    to increase food production with fewer inputs, is already benefiting from regular
    UAS-derived information on crop function, performance, and condition. UAS can
    also benefit yield prediction-related studies, further facilitating effective
    management and planning aspects of the production chain. While red–green–blue
    and multispectral sensors provide a means for many operational crop mapping and
    monitoring solutions, detection of plant disease and assessment of evapotranspiration
    of crops generally require more exploratory analysis of hyperspectral and thermal
    infrared data, respectively. This chapter provides an overview of UAS-based crop
    monitoring applications suitable for precision agriculture and demonstrates, through
    two separate case studies focusing on macadamia and orange trees, the UAS data
    processing chain and workflows required for individual tree crown delineation,
    crown area and tree height measurements, tree condition assessment and identification
    of evaporative fractions, canopy temperature, and associated water stress. This
    chapter concludes with a discussion of best practices for UAS-based data collection
    and processing, as well as an exploration of challenges and prospects for delivering
    valuable agricultural insights to meet the future demands for increasing food
    production. References (0) Cited by (0) View full text Copyright © 2023 Elsevier

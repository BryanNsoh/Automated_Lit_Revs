    rights and content Abstract One of the principal objectives of Integrated Water
    Resources Management (IWRM) is to solve water and development problems using methods
    that are environmentally sustainable, socially equitable, and efficient. In this
    chapter, we demonstrate how the principles of citizen science—the intrinsic involvement
    of nonscientist local stakeholders throughout the entire life cycle of a project—have
    the potential to complement and benefit those of IWRM; in particular, in relation
    to creating scientific evidence that underpins the governance of water resources.
    The rapid, recent development of information and communication technologies such
    as the Internet, smartphones, and social media has already demonstrated their
    capacity to make knowledge creation and governance more multidirectional, decentralized,
    diverse, and inclusive. We show how such new technologies can be harnessed with
    a citizen science approach to interrogate different aspects of the water cycle.
    One particularly promising development is to support citizen science with robust
    and low-cost sensor and networking technology. Such networks offer not only improved
    data coverage (especially in remote or data-scarce regions) but also enhanced
    sustainability at a time when monitoring networks are in decline globally. We
    argue that, in certain cases, citizen science and polycentric governance approaches
    can enrich and complement IWRM and merit greater attention. Previous chapter in

    Evolution Between Citizen Science, Sensor Networks, and Integrated Water Resources
    Management Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) emphasizes long-term sustainable
    approaches to water governance, focusing on co-ordinated decision-making and integrated
    approaches across all sectors (e.g., government, agriculture, and sanitation)
    and scales.1, 2 Exclusively top-down and supply-led water management techniques
    have been recognized as imposing high economic, natural, and social costs on the
    environment and society that are increasingly unsustainable.2, 3 IWRM can be viewed
    as a means of achieving three strategic objectives4: • Equity in water allocation
    to different stakeholders (e.g., social and economic groups); • Efficiency in
    water transfer and use; • Environmental sustainability and protection of the water
    resources base. These salient pillars of IWRM provide an excellent fit with the
    emerging trend of democratizing science and hydrology in particular, in the context
    of citizen science-led research projects.5, 6, 7, 8, 9 While the manner by which
    “citizen science” is interpreted can vary widely depending on the project context,
    they generally involve citizens in at least one of steps of the knowledge generation
    process, that is, data collection, interpretation, analysis, and dissemination
    of results (Section 2). Although the practice of citizen science in hydrology
    and water resources has lagged behind other disciplines, as hydrological data
    are often difficult to interpret intuitively, while measurements tend to be expensive
    (e.g., using highly technical instruments), complex, spatially sparse, and temporally
    dense (for instance, long time series of discharge and precipitation), there is
    an increasing body of examples of citizen-led measurements, such as for precipitation,
    river water, and soil moisture levels.8 This process has been greatly aided by
    rapid technological development over the past 10–15 years, with small, cheap sensors
    now widely available and easy to connect to smartphones, which themselves are
    generally fully Internet-connected and come with sophisticated cameras as standard
    (Section 3.1).10, 11, 12 We therefore identify sizeable potential to combine the
    principles of citizen science with new technologies such as low cost, networked
    sensors that measure variables as disparate as precipitation, soil moisture, dissolved
    oxygen content, and streamflow, within IWRM (Section 3.2).13, 14 At the same time,
    a sensor network has been defined in a hydrological context by the WMO15 as a
    group of data collection activities for different components of the hydrological
    cycle that are designed to address a single objective: this definition shares
    similarities with the fundamentals of IWRM. It is therefore opportune to reflect
    on how the advent of citizen science and emerging sensor network technologies
    can be leveraged jointly to support IWRM. 1.2. The Advent of Low-Cost Networked
    Sensors in IWRM In the past decade, the use of in situ sensors in environmental
    monitoring has increased rapidly16, 17, 18; however, data gaps still exist at
    scales ranging from individual watersheds to the globe. Indeed, recent reviews
    have noted a marked decline in the amount of hydrological data (e.g., precipitation
    and streamflow) being collected in many parts of the world.16, 17, 18, 19, 20
    Moreover, guidance on sensor deployment, use, and data management remains limited.18,
    21 As such, the choice of sensor for a particular activity and the design of a
    suitable network play a crucial role in decision-making in IWRM, for example,
    operational streamflow forecasting, irrigation, flood early warning systems, and
    water quality testing.18, 22, 23 Several such projects have already successfully
    integrated participatory data collection as a means to expand the observational
    database in both space and time.18, 21, 22 Moreover, the physical design of the
    sensor networks themselves for hydrological purposes is also increasingly enriched
    by citizen science approaches to data collection.8, 13, 24, 25 The iterative and
    long-term process of IWRM finds similarities with many citizen science-led projects,
    many of which are more successful when long-term sustainability is considered.13
    These rapid developments contrast against the fact that, over the same very recent
    period, IWRM has remained and still remains highly data scarce. In many regions,
    the lengths of existing time series are insufficient.26 IWRM encompasses many
    areas where a major need for better data availability persists, a lack that entails
    high societal cost (as it has a direct impact upon livelihoods). Also, institutional
    methods often struggle to create “actionable” knowledge at a local level. For
    instance, level and discharge monitoring is usually based on a sparse network
    of gauges that require extensive and technologically complex maintenance, which
    confines it to large institutions and government entities. This restriction often
    entails administrative and even legal issues over data access, which can frustrate
    community-level users.8, 13 The purpose of this chapter is therefore to explore
    the opportunities and potential challenges of citizen science and the use of low-cost
    hydrological sensors as a means to complement institutionalized data collection.
    We demonstrate and elaborate upon the intrinsic link between the two and how they
    can be embedded within a polycentric approach to water resources management, especially
    in remote, impoverished, data-scarce regions. 2. Citizen Science in IWRM 2.1.
    Principles and Background While the concept of citizen science is well established,
    several different definitions, both formal and informal, exist.13 Citizen science
    is most commonly defined as science by nonscientists: it is “… a form of science
    enacted and developed by citizens themselves”27, 28 or “[t]he participation of
    the general public in the research design, data collection and interpretation
    process together with scientists.”8 While there is a wealth of literature on the
    subject,29, 30, 31, 32 true citizen science projects can be differentiated from
    more general stakeholder engagement by the active involvement of citizen volunteers
    throughout the entire lifecycle of the IWRM project, requiring one or more motivational
    aspects, such as improving living standards or fostering a sense of national pride.8
    Such approaches have been encountered in water resources management well before
    IWRM was coined as a term: a bottom-up approach was recognized as key in the sustainable
    management of water resources as early as the 1970s.30, 33 Historically, the main
    motivation for citizen science was often based on environmental data collection
    by volunteers.8, 33 With time, the focus has broadened, shifting from acquiring
    data to other phases of the scientific process, including problem statement, analysis,
    and interpretation. Within this perspective, it is increasingly the citizens who,
    as engaged stakeholders, define the problem at hand and then collect relevant
    environmental information (e.g., observations of streamflow, rainfall, flood damage,
    and so on). A recent framework34 refers to this mode of citizen science as extreme
    citizen science or collaborative learning (Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res

    in citizen science, after Haklay.34 Specific examples within IWRM are shown on
    the right. IWRM, Integrated Water Resources Management. In this interpretation,
    the emphasis is not on the citizen as a scientist but on the scientist as a citizen.35,
    36 This method of practicing science is currently not widely accepted: taking
    into account local needs, practices, and culture, it requires scientists to engage
    at a profound level with the social and ethical aspects of their work.35 This
    process typically involves spending extended periods of time understanding the
    needs and concerns of a range of local stakeholders, the number and (sometimes
    competing) interests of which, in IWRM projects, is often manifold. This form
    of citizen science across an entire project lifecycle is gaining popularity and
    traction within water management and conservation sciences in particular.37, 38,
    39 There is a number of information gaps that hamper effective environmental monitoring
    for evidence-based decision-making, including insufficient data, inconsistent
    metrics, weaknesses in predictive models, and a lack of real-time monitoring systems.40
    While increasing numbers of stakeholders—governments and large development organizations,
    research centers and private companies, and local and national non-governmental
    organizations—engage in data collection, their activities are mostly uncoordinated,
    and the resulting data often remain underutilized. Most worryingly, very rarely
    do those metrics translate into usable, actionable knowledge for the communities
    directly affected by changes in water management.41 Recent research13, 34 has
    demonstrated that community-based monitoring can provide reliable data to help
    fill data gaps, for instance, in catchment and risk management.8, 9, 16, 42, 43
    Comprising both outreach (awareness raising, increased scientific literacy, community
    cohesion, and social capital) and research (robust and meaningful metrics) outputs,
    the participatory, community-led approach can be fruitful for policy development,
    as well as decision-making, across a variety of scales (e.g., local to (inter)national;
    village farmers to government institutions, and so on). The participatory approach
    has been shown to work best when there is active buy-in from the local community.5,
    28, 44 That is, the benefits to local stakeholders should be highlighted. The
    best projects have their aims and objectives defined at the outset; project members
    have appropriate expertise (not just scientifically but also in publicity and
    communication), and there is a clear willingness to listen and adapt as necessary.
    A participant is only a citizen scientist when they actively volunteer (i.e.,
    they are motivated by one or more factors) and maintain their activity throughout
    the duration of the project. In many citizen science projects, the involvement
    of a “community champion” or “gateway organization” (like a local water board,
    farmers'' co-operative, village council) is a key precept to secure long-term
    viability and sustainability; in others, it is possible for participants to lose
    interest and/or fall out of contact with each other and the project leads.10,
    45 Elsewhere, “citizen sensors” are less involved in the aims and formulation
    of the project, collecting data passively without any obvious motivation.11 However,
    the recent tendency is to involve volunteers in all intellectual aspects of the
    science, rather than capitalizing on them as a low-cost workforce.8, 9, 13 The
    implications of the Internet, smartphones, and new developments in sensing technology
    on citizen science in a hydrological context have recently been discussed.13 The
    increased mobile phone saturation across all societal segments—many in the most
    remote regions of the world possess smartphones prior to the arrival of electricity
    or mains water—opens up new ways of both gathering big data and accessing environmentally
    relevant information, having a profound impact upon the work of policymakers.46,
    47 Most current smartphones may be equipped with sensors that can be utilized
    for scientific observation, including transceivers, Frequency Modulation (FM)
    and Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, cameras, accelerometers, digital
    compasses, and microphones.48, 49 While many of these sensors are not directly
    very useful for hydrology, mobile phones themselves can act as conduits of information
    as a means to obtain sensor data (e.g., physical observations, social media, and
    measurements from users sent to the predesigned scientific domain48, 50) and to
    deliver processed information to end users. Although, for reasons noted previously,
    intensive scientific training and specialization are normally prerequisites for
    data analysis and manipulation in hydrology and IWRM projects,51 new technological
    developments can, to some extent, circumvent these limitations, paving the way
    for the more rapid uptake of citizen science (Table 1).8, 13 Table 1. Some Commonly
    Measured Variables in IWRM and Opportunities Emerging From Citizen Science Applications

    2.2. Different Approaches to Citizen Science Many current research and practical
    projects in IWRM involve community-based responses to hazards like river flooding
    or water allocation and stewardship,68, 69, 70 creating the opportunity for real-time
    observation and appropriate courses of action to be taken.10, 71, 72, 73 In the
    majority of these studies, the role of citizen scientists is typically limited
    to information and data gathering rather than leveraging the full potential of
    actionable knowledge cogeneration.9 Compared with citizen science applications
    in bioscience and hydroecology (e.g., measuring water quality parameters and biodiversity),
    there is generally less emphasis on training the project participants.8 Recent
    technological development has, to an extent, obviated the need for intensive training:
    water data can be easily shared via short message service (SMS), instant messaging,
    or social media, requiring a minimum of technical expertise. This is because hydrological
    measurements are, in general, more automatized (cf. in hydroecology, where the
    data collection process is more complex).10, 11, 12 However, expertise is still
    required in the data processing and analysis stage; but because of the ability
    to share and transfer data, this does not necessarily have to be done by the citizens
    (or whoever is in the field) themselves but rather can be undertaken by remote
    experts.11, 12 The degree of self-organization of the citizen scientists varies
    widely, often as a function of the motivational aspects discussed in Section 2.1.
    On one end of the spectrum, water management projects that are labeled as “community-led”
    by the organizers may in practice involve very limited direct community engagement,
    and as a result of this, collect very little data or utilize it sparingly or poorly.
    For instance, drainage and early warning systems to reduce the risk from glacial
    outburst floods in Nepal were constructed and monitored following a remote crowdsourcing
    approach, but little action was then taken, owing to funding concerns and lack
    of continuing interest from participants.74 Moreover, the initial results of the
    Creek Watch program in the Western United States, a smartphone app–based project
    with the objective of water quality monitoring and flood resilience building,
    did not include the possibility of direct user engagement or future self-organization.
    This was related to a lack of specific, well-defined roles for the relevant actors.11
    Sometimes, governmental bodies, scientists, or other high-level stakeholders do
    not recognize local actors as being able to produce high-quality, official information;
    furthermore, community interest or deliberation over possible solutions may be
    lacking.13, 69, 74 On the other end of the spectrum, extensive community-led engagement
    exercises have generated fruitful results for knowledge cogeneration, from rural
    areas with multiple water management issues as in Western Nepal52, 74 to urban
    areas at risk from repeated flooding.68, 69, 70, 75, 76 The most effective projects
    (from the point of view that both scientific and citizen engagement objectives
    are satisfied) involve two-way information flow over the entire project lifecycle,
    which has been shown to improve citizen participation significantly, as well as
    their sense of situational awareness.8, 13, 77 In many of these projects, situational
    analyses led to a prior understanding of local livelihoods, power structures,
    and institutional frameworks, which enabled the scientific interventions to be
    better targeted, increasing local buy-in and long-term project sustainability.8,
    13, 52, 74 However, most citizen science projects in this context only involve
    monitoring and data submission (“citizens as sensors”: a “one-way street” according
    to Liu et al.10), with roll-out of citizen-to-citizen or citizen-to-scientist
    feedback (and more sophisticated information provision systems) generally lacking
    or at an early stage. This may place limits on the sustainability of ostensibly
    “successful” projects (such as those discussed previously).11, 45, 72, 73 For
    this reason, an increasing number of studies focus on the question of how citizen
    science concepts may be leveraged to create actionable knowledge in the context
    of natural resources management, including water resources. 2.3. Polycentric Approaches
    to Water Governance Water is a complex resource to manage for reasons that include
    its uneven global distribution, divergent, and often competing for needs of different
    stakeholders, and its absolute necessity in sustaining life. Managing resources
    in a polycentric manner has the potential to resolve many of these issues. For
    instance, in the polycentric model, water monitoring responsibilities are shared
    and overlap (between, e.g., farmers, local government, and sanitation authorities);
    these overlapping spheres of management ensure that monitoring still takes place
    should one entity neglect its responsibilities.74, 78 A polycentric approach to
    the governance of natural resources has also recently been explored in the context
    of climate change policy79 and has been recognized as paralleling recent technological
    development.77, 79 The combination of this polycentric conceptualization of water
    governance with citizen science strongly suggests that a participatory approach
    to data collection can enhance multidirectional information provision, polycentric
    water governance, local water resources management, and long-term sustainability
    of water resources management projects.8, 13, 25, 77 A polycentric water governance
    model may be more appropriate than IWRM in certain situations.9 Lankford and Hepworth78
    analyzed large watersheds in sub-Saharan Africa, finding their disparate environments,
    communities, and institutions not well suited to the IWRM paradigm, which uses
    a centralized, hierarchical, command, and control regulatory regime. By contrast,
    the actual management of water resources in such basins is characterized by informal,
    flexible, localized decision-making, largely based on local knowledge and dialog.
    Polycentric water resources management was judged to be more effective in such
    remote, data-scarce regions, where decisions tend to be small-scale and incremental.
    Citizen science–based monitoring complements this polycentric water governance
    model in its informality and highly distributed nature.9, 78 In this way, citizen
    science contributes to localized, multitiered decision-making.9 As mentioned earlier,
    the monitoring process itself has benefited greatly from rapid technological progress
    over the past 10–15 years, rendering it easier than ever for a nonscientist to
    make simple measurements or observations via smartphone apps or simple, off-the-shelf,
    low-cost sensors. 3. Low-Cost Sensors in IWRM 3.1. Sensor Networks The installation
    of networks of robust and low-cost sensors (e.g., automatic rain gauges and river-level
    distance sensors) is receiving increasing attention as a way to complement existing
    but often sparse institutional monitoring networks; for instance, in the context
    of risk management.11, 13, 77, 80, 81 One particular context in which such sensors
    have the potential to be particularly effective is that of participatory monitoring.
    The participatory aspect can be limited to the supervision and/or installation
    of such sensor networks. However, in high-risk, low-data availability areas, citizens
    can also provide additional, often qualitative, information via various devices
    such as smartphones (Section 2.1; this information is commonly known as volunteered
    geographic Information [VGI]12, 45). The combination of in situ sensors with VGI
    can act as a mutual support system to improve significantly the coverage of monitored
    areas, thus supporting IWRM.6, 8, 80 In addition to sensor data, relevant VGI-based
    information can take the form of time-stamped and geolocated photographs,10, 11,
    73 social media updates,12, 69, 70 or interviews and feedback to ad hoc hazard
    mitigation websites.68, 71 Smartphone apps have also been developed to this end.10,
    45 On the other hand, a few projects have worked more closely with local communities
    in order to explain to and train participants in the use of more complex monitoring
    principles, for example, water level and flow13, 52, 81 and rain gauges.80 The
    use of low-cost sensors also allows the construction of networks with a spatiotemporal
    density that is much greater than hitherto possible. This is useful to cover the
    strong spatial heterogeneity in catchments over a variety of scales, which is
    still a major challenge in hydrology.18, 66 Indeed, in most parts of the world,
    the spatial density of existing monitoring networks (e.g., rain gauges) is still
    well below the scientifically recommended minimum, which has important impacts
    on operational practices such as flood forecasting.82, 83 It is also a major scientific
    issue; for instance, for the formulation of hypotheses in complex models.84, 85,
    86, 87 We identify three aspects of sensor networks that are particularly relevant
    in this context: • The ubiquity of sensors in low-cost everyday devices like smartphones
    has allowed a greater range of variables to be quantified simultaneously (and
    the sampling density of existing sensor networks to be greatly increased)8, 13,
    14, 88; • Low-cost open-source hardware such as the Arduino platform makes it
    possible to develop ad hoc sensors; for instance, for river stage and precipitation
    measurement8, 24; • The increased accessibility of data repositories in environmental
    sciences and online sharing of results make it possible to combine different datasets
    in novel ways. Since it is often costly and disruptive to create networks of spatially
    representative wired sensors at the scale desired and data access to sensors equipped
    only with local logging is limited by the need to visit sites to download data,
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have emerged as an efficient and economical solution
    for distributed sensing (Section 3.2).20, 89 3.2. Wireless and “Smart” Networks
    WSNs are typically built of nodes (from a few to several thousands); each one
    hosts one or more sensors that monitor specific variables, such as water level,8,
    55, 62 soil moisture,61, 65 or water temperature and chemistry.54, 57, 90 These
    observables are detailed in full in Table 1. Once a measurement has been recorded,
    data are then passed through the network (from node to node: “multi-hop”) to one
    or more data repositories. Wireless network protocols including mobile phone (SMS)
    transmission, Bluetooth, WiFi, and ZigBee work as the backbone of such systems.91,
    92 Each node is composed of several parts: a radio transceiver with an internal
    antenna or connection to an external antenna, a microcontroller, an electronic
    circuit for interfacing with the sensors, and an energy source, usually a battery
    or an embedded form of energy harvesting. Their cost is variable, ranging from
    a few to hundreds of dollars, depending on the complexity of the individual sensor
    nodes. Size and cost constraints on sensor nodes result in corresponding constraints
    on resources such as energy, memory, computational speed, transmission range,
    and data rate transmission.65 Because of these constraints, data collection typically
    proceeds in a distributed manner.61, 91 A distributed control architecture also
    provides the nodes with a back-up in case of failure.20 WSN designs can be optimized
    for sensing accuracy and/or fault tolerance and can be deployed in harsh environments
    to provide continuous monitoring and processing capabilities. As such, they have
    become very popular in IWRM in the past 5–10 years, as they reduce the complexity
    related to the installation and maintenance of the system compared with its wired
    counterpart.20, 57, 92 The development of WSNs is active and ongoing especially
    in the area of power consumption reduction, for instance, through power-aware
    protocols, adaptive radio frequency in nodes, and algorithms to estimate optimal
    sampling frequencies for sensors.20, 57, 60, 92 In water management and elsewhere,
    the development and provision of sensor networks that are intelligent or “smart”
    are now feasible. This increases the flexibility in network design, for example,
    optimizing the balance between spatial coverage, the cost/quality ratio of individual
    sensors, and network redundancy. Moreover, recent improved data storage and transmission
    capacities make it possible to monitor at much higher temporal resolution than
    before. For example, measuring water level at time steps of minutes or less within
    a sensor network would make it possible to measure hydraulic observables such
    as wave characteristics or to track flood wave celerity in a river. As areas of
    interest (e.g., a particular river reach that is prone to flooding) are not uniformly
    spatially distributed, the advantages of smart sensor networks in IWRM are becoming
    increasingly manifest; for instance: • Measurement accuracy can be maximized while
    simultaneously minimizing resource consumption (i.e., energy and network bandwidth).
    • A higher sampling frequency and/or density at points of interest in space and
    time (the corollary of which being lower resource consumption at times and places
    where measurements are not needed). • Certain highly sophisticated, high power
    consumption sensors (e.g., water quality fiber optics) can be switched off when
    not operating, while also optimizing the number of sampling operations; both of
    which could dramatically increase network lifetime.93 • Sensors that talk to each
    other in real time could capture discrete events like flood waves or irrigation
    events. For instance, time series forecasting could be exploited such that a sensor
    placed upstream in a river reach activates successive downstream sensors and/or
    increases their measurement frequency.56, 93 3.3. Manifold Types of Sensors Fig.
    2 shows how many different sensor types can be used to interrogate the various
    aspects of the water cycle and water resources management described in Table 1.
    Within these techniques, there is a continuous spectrum between well-established
    “classic” hydrometric practice, which is often more expensive and/or difficult
    to practition, and newer and more experimental sensor networks, which are usually
    cheaper and more straightforward to implement, thus providing a better fit with
    citizen science principles (Fig. 2). Indeed, for IWRM, the burgeoning community
    of “tech-enthusiastic hydrologists,” for instance, the Measurements and Observations
    in the XXI century working group of the International Association of Hydrological
    Sciences, exemplifies a low-cost, multidisciplinary perspective to tackling complex
    observations and problems.14 Download : Download high-res image (414KB) Download

    of water resources management (Table 1) and a comparison of their ease of integration
    in citizen science projects. We now discuss the possibilities for each measurable
    quantity in water resources management identified earlier (Table 1; Fig. 2) in
    turn. 3.3.1. Precipitation The need for high temporal and spatial resolution precipitation
    data for water management models and mathematical analyses has been discussed
    in several studies.94, 95, 96 The simple design and affordability of rain gauges
    make them particularly suited for application outside the traditional monitoring
    environment. Electronic sensors such as tipping bucket switches allow for convenient
    automatization. Yet, rain gauge measurements are very sensitive to the local aerodynamic
    conditions15 and nonstandard locations or varying local conditions (e.g., undergrowth,
    vegetation blockage), thus affecting the quality and interpretability of measurements.
    Accurate rainfall information is lacking in large areas of the world, and the
    number of rain gauges is severely declining in Europe, South America, and Africa
    especially.88 Although rain gauges provide valuable information, a very dense
    rain gauge network is costly.96 As a result, several new ideas have emerged to
    help estimate areal rainfall with higher temporal and spatial resolution. Disdrometers
    are increasingly used in precipitation monitoring and are both cheap and robust
    in their measurements.86 Other, more experimental, methods for precipitation measurements,
    such as cellular communication interference,64, 86 are under development and may
    eventually provide new possibilities for nonscientist involvement (Section 2).
    New precipitation measurement networks are also being created by exploiting sensors
    embedded within everyday objects; for instance, the optical sensors designed for
    operating car windscreen wipers.96 These new sensor networks have the potential
    to expand spatial coverage greatly while also providing useful additional information
    for hydrological modeling, for example, discharge simulation.19, 88, 96 3.3.2.
    Water Level Accurately monitoring water levels at high spatial and temporal scale
    is a key element in many areas of water resources management, for instance, flood
    risk management systems; yet sensor network design is complex, often expensive,
    and may require extensive maintenance and circumvention of legal issues and property
    laws.8, 58 The need for rapid response times has motivated the accelerated development
    of WSNs in this area.55, 56, 58, 85 Several studies report the use of low-cost
    ultrasonic sensors (often originally intended for some other purpose like monitoring
    diesel levels in fuel tanks) to provide real-time information of river stage in
    flood risk management systems.56, 58, 62 Wireless networks of these sensors have
    allowed flood early warning systems to be deployed at much larger spatial scales
    at an affordable cost.85 Because of their low cost and the ease of purchase, ad
    hoc ultrasonic sensors can be manufactured in a relatively straightforward manner,
    lending themselves to citizen science projects.8, 13, 24 Beyond ultrasound, the
    electromagnetic spectrum can similarly be exploited to quantify river and well
    levels. For instance, the reflection characteristics of long-wavelength (0.1–10
    m) radio waves have been used to interrogate river level changes.97, 98 Such Radio
    Detection and Ranging data are usually obtained from satellite-mounted or airborne
    equipment.97 Near-infrared Light Detection And Ranging systems, first used in
    the 1930s to measure air-density profiles in the upper atmosphere,99 also have
    the potential to be used in tandem with ultrasonic sensors to measure changes
    in water level. Such systems could play an important future role in generating
    (citizen-led) data for IWRM, especially in areas where official monitoring networks
    are sparse or suffer from inadequate management or underfunding.52 3.3.3. Soil
    Moisture Soil water content measurements, which are increasingly automated, play
    a key role in partitioning water and energy fluxes at the land surface and in
    controlling hydrologic fluxes such as groundwater recharge.65 Major technical
    limitations include operational restrictions to narrow ranges of soil apparent
    permittivity and limited measurement accuracy.8 As a result, and despite the usefulness
    of capturing moisture fluctuations in the ground after precipitation events, soil
    moisture is not yet measured operationally at larger scales, unlike, for example,
    precipitation or river stage.18 Only limited attempts have been made to initialize
    ad hoc soil moisture sensor networks: for instance, Bogena et al.65 use a 150-node
    WSN to monitor soil moisture in near real-time for a small catchment in Western
    Germany. According to these workers, the prohibitively high sensor density needed
    to assess heterogeneities in soil moisture precludes the development of a more
    spatially extensive network. Normally, soil moisture sensors are incorporated
    in a wider network with other types of sensors and have found frequent use in
    automated irrigation systems. 3.3.4. Sensor Clusters In water resources management,
    sensor networks can be designed such that each station incorporates many different
    types of sensors, which is important for assessing catchment-scale water balances17,
    20, 61 or in the sustainable use of water resources in agriculture.60, 100, 101
    Multisensor networks can reduce hydrological uncertainty in at least three ways.
    First, redundant measurements improve estimations of change in meteorological
    variables like precipitation and relative humidity synchronously; second, distributed
    measurements capture local variability and constrained uncertainty in many derived
    hydrological attributes important for modeling and prediction; and finally, basin-scale
    patterns (e.g., elevation gradients in precipitation and their effect on streamflow)
    can be captured more completely than using sensors that measure a single variable.20
    Kerkez et al.61 deployed a WSN in an IWRM project as part of a water balance instrument
    cluster across a headwater catchment in the southern Sierra Nevada of California;
    over 300 sensors provided spatially representative measurements of snow depth,
    solar radiation, relative humidity, soil moisture, and matric potential. In this
    instance, the performance of the WSN was interrogated. Two indicators of network
    performance—viz. the packet delivery ratio and received signal strength indicator—showed
    that for the specific site conditions, a conservative 50-m node-to-node spacing
    would ensure low-power, reliable, and robust network communications. A balance
    between the number of sensing and signal repeating nodes was sought to ensure
    proper spatial radio coverage. Lundquist et al.21 had implemented a similar WSN
    in the same area earlier, which measured the same quantities, but on a smaller
    scale. In both studies, it was realized that because of the steep and variable
    topography, communication techniques had to be tailored to suit each location,
    resulting in a hybrid network of radio, cell-phone, land-line, and satellite transmissions.
    Elsewhere, larger-scale, multiple-catchment IWRM studies usually employ sparser
    networks of sensor clusters. For instance, the Gradients Along Mountain to Urban
    Transitions monitoring network involves real-time data collection that is used
    to model water quality, inputs, and outputs between urban and rural areas in Northern
    Utah (Jones et al., 2017). Similarly, Ingelrest et al.66 describe the blueprint
    for a multisensor WSN called SensorScope, which has been deployed multiple times
    in various environments to interrogate water demand in urban environments. In
    this instance, the sensor network is described as a “turnkey solution” that requires
    very little site-specific adjustment beyond possible alterations to sampling frequency,
    as well as interactions with local end-users in each project (Section 2). 3.4.
    Sensor Networks in IWRM Hydrometric information collected from the different types
    of sensor networks detailed in Section 3.2 constitutes the fundamental input for
    the design of various water resources projects such as freshwater distribution
    systems,63, 90 irrigation networks,60, 89 and flood early warning systems.85,
    102 An adequately designed network should therefore be able to provide appropriate
    information for a range different users and industries, in the cross-sectoral
    spirit of IWRM. Fig. 3 shows how such networks, their operation, and design, as
    well as calibration, can benefit from a citizen science approach to yield enhanced
    decision-making capabilities in IWRM. Download : Download high-res image (232KB)

    The WMO15 emphasized the importance of establishing an optimum network, where
    the interpolation between values at different stations should make it possible
    to determine the characteristics of the basic hydrometeorological elements at
    any point within a country. They also suggest beginning with the definition of
    the institutional setup and the purposes, objectives, and priorities of the network,
    followed by optimization procedures and financial revisions before final implementation.
    Table 2 contains examples of different sensor networks that have recently been
    implemented in water management projects across the globe. Although many of these
    networks concern rivers, ad hoc groundwater (Valencia, Spain103) and underwater
    quality (Wuhan, China: Lv et al.102) monitoring networks have also been discussed.
    It is clear from Table 2 that the peculiarities of sensor network design (for
    instance, the number of nodes, sampling frequency, and power supply) vary widely
    not only according to the purpose of the project but also in response to the realities
    of sensor deployment in often harsh and inaccessible environments. Most of these
    studies, especially over the last 10 years, have been concerned with developing
    new (and often hybrid) monitoring methods or experimenting with new technology,
    rather than “classic” hydrological research. However, none of these networks is
    yet at the stage of integration in operational IWRM; the object of many of the
    studies detailed in Table 2 was simply to experiment with new technology. Table

    has great potential to broaden the variety of sensor network designs. Typical
    observables that can be measured by sensors to assess water quality include water
    temperature, dissolved oxygen content, turbidity, conductivity/salinity, trace
    element concentration, pressure, redox potential, and pH.8, 52 WSNs and real-time
    controlling and monitoring systems have been successfully integrated to monitor
    water quality for domestic applications.57, 59 In drinking water distribution
    systems, low-cost and lightweight optical and electrochemical sensors, which rapidly
    assess water quality on-the-fly within pipes, provide one example of new technology
    having the potential to complement existing monitoring.59, 67 The setup and customization
    of the sensors and WSN must be straightforward since the technology is relatively
    new and may be unfamiliar to water company engineers in many cases.67 Moreover,
    the sensor nodes are designed to be optimized for rapid installation since deployment
    inside the piped network involves the cessation of water flow and associated loss
    in revenue.59 At the other end of the scale, Banik et al.23 detail a water quality
    monitoring network in a sewer system. In this case the objective is to protect
    the receiving water bodies and mitigate against accidental spills and unauthorized
    discharges. Fewer sensors are required at locations that are more specific and
    carefully selected compared with drinking water quality monitoring, where the
    sensors are typically more densely and evenly spaced.23, 59 Once gray water has
    been discharged into the natural ecological system, the receiving lakes, rivers,
    and wetlands are similarly monitored for water quality. Nasirudin et al.63 describe
    one example, where a WSN system is used as a platform to monitor water quality
    readings, deployed at distributed locations where each node can interface with
    various water quality sensors. Since such sensor networks are typically installed
    in more remote, rural areas, optimized power management is critical: sensors and
    components were chosen on the basis of their low power consumption, while batteries
    are recharged with multiple solar panels. In addition to monitoring water quality
    in domestic water systems, there are a growing number of studies that focus on
    the use of distributed sensor networks that assess flow rate, which is critical
    when the location of leakages is sought. Data transmission often uses GSM to send
    SMSs to network engineers when a problem is detected. In a more automated example,
    the most basic sensor networks might measure water level in a collecting tank,
    sounding an alarm and/or switching on a pump once the level drops below a critical
    threshold.53 Han et al.104 describe a more sophisticated cyber-physical-human
    distributed sensor framework, which leverages data dynamically from multiple information
    sources including Internet of Things–sensing data, geophysical data, human input,
    and simulation/modeling engines to identify leakages and pipe failures rapidly
    (within minutes) and accurately (individual pipeline level). Sensor networks are
    increasingly integrated within automated irrigation systems, which rely on logic
    and Boolean expressions in the same manner as the aforementioned water level alarm
    example.89, 101 Motivated by increasing water demand globally, sensor networks
    can be used to study soil dynamics based on information gathered at regular intervals,
    and the data collected can be used as feedback to improve irrigation efficiency.22
    Gutiérrez et al.60 created an automated irrigation system to optimize water use
    for a crop of sage based on a distributed wireless network of soil moisture and
    temperature sensors placed in the root zone of the plants. Water quantity was
    controlled via an algorithm with threshold values of temperature and soil moisture;
    a cellular–Internet interface allowed for data inspection and irrigation scheduling
    to be programmed through a Web page. After 3 months, water savings of up to 90%
    were achieved compared with traditional irrigation practices. Kim et al.89 employed
    a similar system using low-cost Bluetooth wireless radio communication, while
    McCulloch et al.22 developed a network of more sophisticated sensors that measured
    soil moisture, pH, temperature, and humidity, at three different ground depths.
    In all three cases, sensor nodes were developed using off-the-shelf components
    and were designed to withstand seasonal weather changes and be resistant to damage
    that may be inflicted by wildlife (and domestic cattle) in the field. Furthermore,
    because of their energy autonomy and low cost, these systems have the potential
    to be useful in water-limited, geographically isolated areas. Stable remote access
    to field conditions and real-time control and monitoring of variable-rate irrigation
    controllers can be effectively supported by graphical user interface–based software.22,
    60, 89, 101 4. Discussion What are the main benefits and potential drawbacks of
    using citizen science and polycentric approaches to enrich and complement IWRM
    projects? When an integral component of citizen science projects would typically
    involve sensor-sourced data collection by nonscientists, the design of the sensor
    network may need to be technically simplified so that self-consistent samples
    can be taken.8 Paul et al.13 summarize the challenges and opportunities arising
    from citizen science sensor networks in hydrology. One example is that, while
    the use of smartphones to photograph flooding extent and river level has the potential
    to form a very dense network of “citizen sensors” (i.e., crowdsourcing), the data
    conversion to input for numerical models, as well as the provision of information
    back to volunteers, remain challenging and are under active development.25, 77
    Indeed, networks that use volunteers as sensors can be integrated within a broader
    project framework or so-called Environmental Virtual Observatories (EVOs77). For
    instance, Galimberti and Balbo105 describe an Italian application that receives
    water level data, collected and sent by citizens, in river cross-sections instrumented
    with a staff gauge and an information panel, performs simple reliability checks,
    before storing and freely disseminating data in near real-time. The data then
    have the potential to be used for further research, model calibration, and validation
    or for land use planning and design. The keyword here is potential: at present,
    many projects that exploit citizen observatory or EVO data, such as the EU-funded
    WeSenseIt and GroundTruth programs, exist only as proofs of concept.106 Both projects
    aim to leverage crowdsourced observations to improve hydrological modeling and
    flood forecasting applications; yet they acknowledge that operationalizing such
    new data acquisition strategies, for instance, in an IWRM environment, is not
    a primary objective.105, 106 Other innovative projects such as Transforming Weather
    Water data into value-added Information services for sustainable Growth in Africa
    aim to enhance satellite datasets with ground-based sensors to derive actionable
    geoinformation, such as flash flood warnings or scheduling improvements to water
    management infrastructure. This question—of how to integrate citizen science data
    into operational IWRM practice—has scientific, technical, and political dimensions,
    which we now discuss in turn. These data are potentially lower quality and more
    temporally sparse compared with the demands of hydrological models for typically
    long-term, high-quality time series (i.e., a more traditional data source) for
    calibration and validation. One solution has been to apply novel merging algorithms,
    for instance, between rain gauge data and satellite precipitation products, to
    create combined datasets.94, 107 Another issue is that the longevity of citizen
    science projects is variable and depends, in part, on the motivational factors
    of the nonscientist stakeholders; this creates an added layer of uncertainty in
    terms of their sustainable integration in longer-term IWRM projects.8, 106 Nevertheless,
    it is clear that, within water resources management, data collection is becoming
    increasingly multi-tiered, involving increased diversity in terms of actors, purposes,
    and tailored, multiobjective networks. This creates favorable conditions for the
    discovery of new ways in which citizen science data can play a role in an operational
    IWRM context. Although, in the past few years, it has been recognized that “citizen
    hydrology” can surmount the challenges of high observational costs and limited
    spatial coverage of traditional hydrometric networks,8, 13, 87, 108 the effects
    of decreased observational frequency, irregular availability, and variable accuracy
    from sensor to sensor, need to be quantified before the data can be used in hydrological
    modeling. Indeed, uncertainties are a major bottleneck to the more widespread
    use and integration of citizen science data in operational IWRM systems; ideally,
    they should be characterized as explicitly and transparently as possible, for
    instance by providing uncertainty bounds. Yet citizen science data are rarely
    presented in such a form due to the inherent difficulties in uncertainty quantification.8,
    87 Davids et al.108 and Mazzoleni et al.87 attempt to resolve this issue, which,
    unchecked, could create suspicion and wariness over citizen science data on the
    part of end users. Somewhat against the principles of citizen science, crowdsourced
    observations were mimicked using synthetic time series (for water level and streamflow
    data87) and bootstrap randomized subsampling (for streamflow data108) to this
    end. Uncertainty was characterized by assuming observational error to be normally
    distributed noise with zero mean and a given standard deviation, using a coefficient
    α to represent measurement uncertainty. The maximum value of α was assumed to
    be three times higher for citizen science data than for actual sensor data. Distributed
    observations from “social” and physical sensors were then assimilated to understand
    the sensitivity of various hydrological models under various scenarios.87 The
    main conclusions were that artificial citizen science data, while sometimes asynchronous
    and inaccurate can still complement traditional sensor networks formed by few
    accurate, static sensors. Variations in observational frequency only had a minor
    effect on model results of, for example, flood forecasting and catchment water
    balances; in this sense, adaptive monitoring could greatly lower uncertainties
    in citizen science hydrology data.87, 106, 108 The next step would be to apply
    these uncertainty quantification techniques to real datasets. According to Gura,109
    people management issues and the very large scale of some citizen science projects
    have the potentially greatest negative impact on data quality. Moreover, volunteer
    recruitment and engagement throughout the project duration remain a challenge,
    with possible solutions including the development of a “ranking system” or the
    identification and promotion of particularly able volunteers.109 There are other,
    nontechnical, factors that govern the uptake of citizen science data. Especially
    in developing countries, the proposals of nonscientist knowledge may not adhere
    to the often rigid institutionalized processes through which knowledge (e.g.,
    national networks of rain gauges) is collected.110 In this way, it may be difficult
    for the proposals of nonscientist local stakeholders to feed into the decision-making
    that is controlled largely by water resources–related bureaucracies. Buytaert
    et al.8 emphasize that acquired knowledge is political: therefore, the way in
    which it is created and represented—its legitimacy, and to what extent it is contested—is
    at least as important as the design of citizen science data collection activities
    itself. Moreover, many water-related data, such as water consumption, in an IWRM
    context have a financial aspect, emphasizing the importance of economic value
    as well as political legitimacy. It is also critical that the data and generated
    knowledge be (and be perceived as) locally relevant and actionable. To this end,
    the feedback loops between citizen science and decision-making should be clear
    and transparent at a variety of different levels; they depend upon a profound
    understanding on the part of individual nonscientists of the generated information.8,
    13 Having articulated these challenges of operationalizing citizen science data,
    it is also important to recall opportunities related to their intrinsic value:
    local measurements will always be of great importance in hydrological modeling.
    Indeed, one significant problem in water management is that the parameters of
    many laws that govern hydrological processes are very local and can only be quantified
    with measurements. Insight gained from one catchment cannot necessarily be transferred
    automatically to another one, even if it borders the other. The fundamental issue
    concerns the extreme spatial and temporal heterogeneity of most quantities in
    the water cycle—precipitation, streamflow, river stage, soil moisture inter alia
    (Table 1; Fig. 2)—which explains the proliferation of different designs of sensor
    networks (many of which operated by nonscientists) that aim to quantify these
    variables. In terms of the use of WSNs for water resources monitoring and management,
    while there is still enormous potential for future growth, there are also manifold
    challenges. These include the relatively modest scale of current operational deployments
    (rarely beyond small catchment scale61, 91); limitations of off-the-shelf components;
    a lack of suitable sensors; and the cost of deployment and data collection. Moreover,
    important application-specific requirements may not be well catered for using
    off-the-shelf components (e.g., variable sampling rates, well-defined and flexible
    sensor interfaces, ease of deployment, and network models for the broader environment).
    Therefore, although individual-application sensor node design is continually improving,
    there should be greater flexibility in these designs such that networks can interact
    with each other successfully (Section 3.2). In water resources management, the
    direct engagement of citizen scientists in the data processing stage is ripe for
    expansion: the joint analysis and interpretation of data could represent a more
    fundamental means to enhance citizens'' participation in, and education about,
    water resources management projects.13 The following question then arises: how
    can this expansion of nonscientist involvement in data analysis and processing
    be carried out? The citizen science approach emphasizes the benefits using nonscientists
    as basic interpreters, placing renewed focus on data logging, quality control,
    and transmission. Web-based services allow for easy connection of sensors with
    online modeling tools to provide real-time data quality control, storage, and
    simulation. From a technical perspective, regions with low Internet penetration
    can benefit from far-reaching mobile phone coverage for sensor data transmission
    via text messaging.8 The provision of information and data back to nonscientists,
    in a manner that is comprehensible for a nonscientific audience, serves as an
    incentive for further citizen participation. In water resources management, this
    could take the form of irrigation requirements (for farmers), modeled water use
    and demand (for policymakers), or flood vulnerability maps (for the general public).
    Although this important feedback aspect of citizen science is lightly developed,7,
    35 especially in an IWRM context,69, 70, 72 we believe that the recent growth
    of Internet technologies could create excellent opportunities for user feedback
    and communication beyond the scientific project itself. In the small number of
    cases where information provision and citizen feedback are integral to project
    development, the situational awareness and participation rates of participants,
    as well as levels of community buy-in, are high.9, 10, 77 To summarize, we have
    described how emerging sensor network technologies can be leveraged jointly with
    citizen science to support IWRM, which in certain situations can be enriched by
    polycentric approaches to water governance. Networks of low-cost sensors, in particular,
    can be a useful tool to promote such approaches: increasing the number of catchment-scale
    networks that exploit citizen science and these sensors could greatly enrich operational
    IWRM practice. Indeed, if recent technological advances (such as adaptive sampling
    and “smart sensors”) are harnessed by citizen science projects, the resulting
    data could be better integrated in operational IWRM practice, rather than serving
    as small-scale proofs of concept. 5. Conclusions The growth of citizen science
    in hydrology and water resources management can be explained by the prior inaccessibility
    and sparseness of water-related datasets, as well as the development of new technology
    such as Internet-connected smartphones. The active involvement of citizen scientists
    through the entire lifecycle of a practical IWRM project can enhance local uptake,
    support local diagnostics, and increase decision capacity. In other words, the
    principles of polycentric water governance and citizen science are very strongly
    aligned and are expressed well in the form of low-cost sensor networks. Indeed,
    we have also described how such sensor networks that interrogate, for instance,
    river level, precipitation, and soil moisture, provide a useful tool in polycentric
    water governance. Technological developments resulting in the ubiquity of these
    sensors, together with improved methods for data storage, retrieval, and processing,
    have the potential to improve the sustainability of water resources management
    greatly. Moreover, adaptive sampling techniques could lower the uncertainty in
    citizen science datasets, which is a key bottleneck to their more general uptake
    in operational IWRM environments. What is clear is that citizen science can be
    used to bridge potentially wide gaps between contextual science and practical
    field experience in water resources management projects. Combining citizen science
    approaches with networks of low-cost sensors makes for a useful addition to the
    water resources management toolkit, which has the potential to increase data coverage
    drastically, especially in remote or data-scarce regions, at a time when monitoring
    networks are in decline globally. In many such cases, we conclude that polycentric
    and citizen science approaches have great potential to enrich and benefit IWRM.

    Excerpt : However, such improvements are generally costly, time-consuming, and
    may not produce immediate or tangible benefits at the local level. Recently, citizen
    science has emerged as a more useful tool in WRM to energise local stakeholders,
    placing them at the heart of decisions regarding water resources (Paul et al.,
    2018; Paul and Buytaert, 2018). Non-scientist-collected data can enhance and densify
    more traditional datasets in space and time; while rapid technological advances
    in the last 10–15 years and the ubiquity of low-cost ‘smart’ sensors in everyday
    devices like smartphones (part of the Internet of Things: Gubbi et al., 2013)
    have increased the feasibility of participatory data collection within a devolved
    monitoring framework (Buytaert et al., 2014; Paul et al., 2018). Show abstract

  description: An adequate water supply is essential for the growth and development
    of crops. When rainfall is insufficient, irrigation is necessary to meet crop
    water needs. It is a crucial and strategic aspect of economic and social development.
    To combat climate change, there is a need to adopt irrigation management techniques
    that increase and stabilize agricultural production while saving water, using
    intelligent agricultural water technologies. Internet of things (IoT) based technologies
    can achieve optimal use of water resources. This article introduces a smart real-time
    irrigation management system based on the internet of things. It provides optimal
    management of irrigation decisions using real-time weather and soil moisture data,
    as well as data from precipitation forecasts. The proposed algorithm is developed
    in real-time based on the IoT, enabling us to guide irrigation and control the
    amount of water in agricultural applications. The system uses real-time data analysis
    of climate, soil, and crop data to provide flexible planning of the irrigation
    system’s use. A case study from the Fez-Meknes region in Morocco is presented
    to demonstrate the proposed system’s effectiveness.

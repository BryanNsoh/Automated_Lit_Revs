    The present world population will increase to 8 billion people in 2023. Rapid
    population growth according to the United Nation (UN) makes it more difficult
    to eradicate poverty, end hunger and malnutrition, and broaden access to healthcare
    and educational opportunities [1]. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation predicts
    that the global food supply would need to increase by 70% by 2050 as a result
    of decreasing agricultural lands and the depletion of limited natural resources
    [2]. As a result there is a pressing need to raise farm productivity. Due to a
    lack of natural resources such as fresh water and cultivated land as well as trends
    in declining agricultural yields for several key commodities the issue has gotten
    worse. Another obstacle is the agricultural workforce’s changing organisational
    structure. There seem to be astonishing numbers for the Indian agricultural industry.
    With a Gross Value Addition of US Dollar 265.51 billion it supports the livelihood
    of 58% of Indians. Despite employing around 58% of the working force directly
    and indirectly, this industry only provides about 15.87% of the nation''s Gross
    Domestic product (GDP) [3]. The topic of agricultural productivity is brought
    up as a result. Agricultural Value Added per Worker is the indicator that is most
    frequently used to gauge agricultural output. China, India, Indonesia and other
    impoverished or emerging countries with large populations have the lowest agricultural
    value added per worker. India has the lowest agricultural value added per worker
    among the top 20 economies. Water is essential to life for all creatures including
    plants and animals. It is a fundamental necessity of every human being. The only
    way that water is used in agriculture in India today is for irrigation. This proportion
    may increase as a result of increased food consumption and population growth.
    So a problem that affects most agriculture is a lack of water. By applying various
    water-saving strategies this can be reduced to a minimum. There are many strategies
    to stop or minimise water waste. Tamil Nadu''s quick development and industrialisation
    is responsible for the state''s excessive water usage. The primary factor influencing
    the rapid deployment of ground water irrigation is the ongoing change in Tamil
    Nadu''s yearly rainfall pattern. The main objective of this work is to use groundwater
    irrigation to decrease the negative effects of water scarcity on crop productivity
    in order to sustain agriculture in Tamil Nadu throughout the year. This investigation
    looks at temporal variations in irrigated areas between 2000 and 2014 [4]. We
    use spectral matching methods to map and classify the seven bands of MODIS satellite
    images of the land surfaces in order to show changes in rainfall at the sub-basin
    level. The only way that water is used in agriculture today is for irrigation.
    This proportion may increase as a result of increased food consumption and population
    growth. Thus, one of the problems facing the planet is water scarcity. Day by
    day the most efficient plant monitoring systems currently in use make use of plant
    optical and infrared imaging. Everyone needs water including humans, animals,
    and plants. It is a fundamental necessity of human being. Water waste is the key
    problem in the majority of agriculture. By applying various water-saving strategies
    this can be reduced to a minimum. There are many strategies to stop or minimise
    water waste. Water is trickled onto the plant’s roots using drip irrigation which
    is the most effective method of irrigation [5]. A sprinkler system is an irrigation-based
    system that makes use of tubes-mounted guns, sprays, or sprinklers. Abiotic and
    biotic constraints are two categories of environmental limitations that have an
    impact on crop production. Actually these aspects are more obvious due to climate
    change brought on by global warming [6]. Abiotic stresses modify a plant''s morphology,
    physiology, biochemistry, and molecular structure which negatively affects its
    growth and productivity. Climate and soil characteristics (soil components, physicochemical,
    pH, and biological features) (drought, flood, cold, heat stress, etc.) are examples
    of abiotic constraints. On the other hand biotic variables include weeds, vertebrate
    pests, pathogens, beneficial species (pollinators, decomposers, and natural enemies),
    and anthropogenic evolution. To address all the environmental issues that are
    lowering crop yields and maintaining food security, trans- and multidisciplinary
    research is required. Numerous factors present a severe risk that will lower productivity
    if farms are not adequately monitored and maintained. Three categories biological,
    environmental, and technological can be used to categorise these variables [7].
    Due to the need to increase crop production and the increasing use of farming
    practises like irrigation, extensive inorganic fertiliser application, and synthetic
    chemical weed and insect control, more land has been converted to agriculture
    [8]. These operations have decreased the quality of the soil, the water, exacerbated
    soil erosion, contaminated groundwater and the quality of the food. In an effort
    to enhance yields on current farms while reducing the environmental effect of
    agriculture this has prompted programmes for sustainable development [9,10,11,12,13].
    Today wireless sensor networks play a huge role in agriculture. These systems
    among others include those that use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) based
    traceability systems, continuously monitor the environment and preserve agricultural
    accuracy. For the automated irrigation system to transmit the sensor data for
    the soil moisture content, temperature, and humidity to the remote area, a wireless
    modem using LoRa is essential. Wireless sensor networks are used to remotely monitor
    humidity and temperature information on a regular or irregular basis utilising
    General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) based systems. The aforementioned information
    allows us to frame the proposal’s objective as Fabrication of monitoring device
    with AI analyzation of Drought Monitoring and forecasting by Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data from MODIS Satellite. The contributions
    of the study are as follows NDVI time series data from MODIS Satellite along with
    Micro climate Analysis for adapting the new cropping pattern. Implementation of
    irrigation depends on age of crops and Micro climate using AI To monitor crop
    growth leaf colour changes, pest control, nutrients deficiency by Spectrogram
    images adopting AI. Also provide Fertilizer calculator to have a realistic estimate
    of the quality of fertilizer needed for our crop and area. To proposed LoRa Technology
    transmit all sensors data from farm field to control unit without Global System
    for Mobile communication (GSM) technology and any other Internet facilities. 2
    Literature review Currently irrigation is the only usage of water in agriculture.
    Increased food demand and population expansion could cause this percentage to
    increase. Therefore a global issue is the lack of water [14]. Utilising plant
    optical and infrared pictures the most effective plant monitoring systems are
    being implemented daily [15]. Every human, animal and plant needs water to survive.
    Every human being has a basic need for it. Water waste is the main issue in the
    majority of agriculture. Utilising various water saving techniques can help to
    lessen this [16]. There are numerous ways to prevent or reduce water waste. The
    first one is the ditch irrigation system, in which rows of seeds are placed in
    ditches that have been dug out. For the passage from the main ditch to the canals
    there are tubes resembling syphon tubes. The most effective technique of irrigation
    is drip irrigation which involves pouring water onto the plant''s roots [17, 18].
    Sprinkler systems are another type of irrigation-based system that employ sprinklers,
    sprays or guns mounted on tubes. The tubes carry water and some of the ends include
    sprinklers to apply water where it is needed. The sprinkler won’t activate until
    the temperature and humidity sensor in the root zone surpasses the threshold value.
    The rotary system is the best irrigation technique for large regions. The rotary
    system uses mechanically driven sprinklers that travel in a round motion due to
    its 100-foot range. As a result the device sprinkles over time in a larger area
    while using less water. For the purpose of watering cotton crops, infrared thermometers
    are utilised to measure the temperature of the remote canopy [19]. A temperature
    threshold is upheld during this process. When the canopy temperature rises above
    a certain threshold the mechanism activates. The majority of irrigation systems
    are automated rather than manual in order to maximise cotton production and water
    usage. An alternative parameter to calculate agricultural irrigation requirements
    is plant Evapotranspiration (ET). When two terms are combined as in evaporation
    and plant transpiration the result is called ET. Evaporation is the vaporisation
    of water from soil, water bodies and canopy interception [20] into the atmosphere.
    Water vaporises from stems, flowers, and leaves during the process of transpiration.
    Water reductions of up to 42% are possible with ET-based systems [21]. Due to
    uses like vehicle monitoring and robot control, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)
    nodes have grown in popularity in recent years. IRIS nodes built on TINY OS are
    used to measure the soil moisture content of paddy fields [15]. The most popular
    method for measuring the data in irrigation fields is the ZigBee transmission
    of data from end devices. However the distance between the two nodes is only 10
    to 100 m when these devices are used. As a result the majority of applications
    transport data to faraway locations using GPRS-based technologies [17]. ZigBee-based
    transmission is used in the agricultural sector to collect data from numerous
    sensor nodes. In today''s world wireless sensor networks are essential to agriculture
    and the food industry. These systems among others, include those that use RFID-based
    traceability systems, continuously monitor the environment and uphold agricultural
    precision [16].A wireless modem using GSM/GPRS is called the SIM900A. It is crucial
    for the automated irrigation system to communicate the values from the soil moisture
    [12] content sensor as well as the temperature, humidity and other sensor data
    to the remote area. The AT commands can be used to do this. The microcontroller
    unit and GSM/GPRS modem are interfaced [12]. Wireless sensor networks are used
    for remote monitoring using GPRS-based systems to continuously or sporadically
    monitor temperature and humidity data in industry and even in agricultural [18].Various
    models and limitations of existing systems are discussed in the Table 1. Table
    1 Comparison of existing systems Full size table The main objective of this article
    is to develop an automatic watering system using AI and sensors linked to a microcontroller.
    This study made use of the DHT11 sensor for temperature and humidity as well as
    the VH400 sensor for soil moisture. These sensors are interfaced with the microcontroller
    unit which was buried beneath the root zone of the plant. Sending an SMS to a
    mobile phone of a remote owner is the main goal of using a microcontroller. SMS
    messages are delivered using the SIM900A module which is coupled to the microcontroller
    unit. The irrigation system is put to the test with various plants at various
    humidity and temperature levels in both dry and typical situations. To keep the
    water content in those specific regions soil moisture sensors are used. All results
    acquired under wet and normal conditions have been shown to be logical. 2.1 LoRa
    technology A LoRa-enabled architecture for precise irrigation and monitoring has
    been demonstrated [28] with each sensor node being able to connect to another
    LoRa-enabled receiver and create a communication channel. A low-power operating
    method called LoRa allows for transmission and reception over a vast communication
    range. Despite the fact that LoRa technology makes it simple to transfer sensor
    data from farm fields to a control unit. Field-installed sensors gather information
    about things like soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. These sensors broadcast
    the data in discrete packets using low-power, long-range wireless technology called
    LoRa. The packets are sent by LoRa-capable sensors to LoRa gateways placed around
    the farm. Gateways accept the packets and use the LoRaWAN (LoRa Wide Area Network)
    protocol to send them to a central control unit. The control unit gathers and
    analyses the incoming data to produce actionable insights. Real-time updates on
    crop conditions may be included in this data, enabling knowledgeable decisions
    on pest management, fertilisation, and irrigation. 2.2 Challenges of AI Although
    implementing AI in the agricultural sector faces significant obstacles it is a
    logical step towards smart agriculture for efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable
    farming. The agricultural sector and the field of AI research are not connected.
    Therefore AI researchers are not well-versed in the issues that farmers confront,
    and farmers are also not well-versed in the AI technologies that are currently
    available. It will take more interdisciplinary cooperation to find a solution
    to this dual issue. The use of AI in agriculture is still in its early stages,
    hence there aren''t any established norms or regulations. As a result there are
    several legal questions surrounding smartt farming. Because the majority of AI-IoT
    solutions were cloud-based until recently, farmers were reluctant to adopt AI
    methods due to worries about cyber attacks, data security, and privacy. A new
    IoT option called \"Edge AI\" has emerged to address this problem. Edge AI handles
    sensor data locally and offers better data protection and privacy as well as reduced
    latency and cost. Another challenge for AI in agriculture is a lack of data. AI
    is a data-driven technology. The absence of pertinent data makes it difficult
    to deploy certain AI algorithms. In remote, rural areas with no higher speed mobile
    networks but where agriculture is the main industry, edge AI has the potential
    to transform the game. The potential for intelligent agriculture is increased.
    Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) were used in [29] to compress sensor image data
    at the edge layer before transmitting the compressed data to the fog layer using
    LoRa technology. 3 System architecture The three layers of the proposed system
    architecture are depicted in Fig. 1. Layer 1: A farming device The foundation
    layer of the smart farm architecture is called layer. It consists of numerous
    components, including sensors which are dispersed across the agricultural ground.
    These devices also known as distributed source nodes, are simply LoRa wireless
    sensor networks. They recognise the physical parameters continuously collect data
    in real-time and send it to the gateway node at the following layer. The data
    received by several sensors and cameras in various smart agriculture applications
    is shown in Fig. 2. For instance data is gathered by on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
    (UAV) sensors and cameras in a field of rice and relayed to the edge where subsurface
    soil sensors process it. Fig. 1 System architecture Full size image Fig. 2 Product
    over view Full size image Layer-2: The Edge Computing Layer is included in Layer
    2. There are several edge nodes in this. Depending on the particular smart agriculture
    system, different nodes may be present. Here, layer-1 data is processed, filtered
    and encrypted. Due of resource constraints at the edge layer the prognostic and
    solution components were previously completed at the following layer. Trained
    machine learning models can perform prognostics and provide suggestions at this
    layer, nevertheless thanks to recent hardware advancements and initiatives for
    AI at the edge. However if the task requires a lot of resources or is not time-sensitive,
    prognosis and inference can both be done in the following layer. For instance
    the ESP8266 for integrating smart agricultural components to manage environmental
    conditions [25] and the ESP32 for smart irrigation [26]. Layer-3: The third or
    uppermost layer in the bottom-up design of the smart agriculture system is cloud
    computing. This virtual layer is often located in data centres and is accessible
    via the Internet from any location in the world [27]. Massive amounts of data
    generated by cameras or sensors in agricultural farms are required. 4 Data 4.1
    Satellite data The seven bands of MODIS are used to measure surface reflectance.
    Blue wavelengths between 459 and 479 nm, green between 545 and 565 nm, red between
    620 and 670 nm, near-infrared between 841 and 875 nm, and short-wave infrared
    between 1628 and 2155 nm, are used to examine vegetation and land surfaces. For
    monitoring the vegetation at a continental scale [30] using the Terra platform''s
    MODIS 500-m resolution and 8-day surface reflectance. Scientific Data Set documentation
    for MOD09A1 [31] is given. The study also included secondary data in addition
    to the original data set, which came from MODIS time-series data as shown in Fig.
    3a Fig. 3 a Rainfall fluctuations over time in different irrigated agricultural
    areas in Tamil Nadu. b Tamil Nadu agricultural land classification, by source,
    with major river basins Full size image 4.2 River basins and their irrigated area
    There are 40,000 tanks, 1 million wells, and 61 large reservoirs that rely extensively
    (17.5 BCM) on surface water. Surface irrigation is not as important as ground
    water irrigation (15. 3 BCM). Table 2 provides information on the basin''s irrigation
    condition for 39 years, from 1976 to 2014, together with 54 years'' worth of rainfall
    data, from 1961 to 2014 shown in Fig. 3b also. At the sub-national level, which
    is similar to a state, county or district, statistics on the total amount of irrigated
    agriculture and irrigated area of the country were gathered. The Department of
    Economics and Statistics of the Tamil Nadu government provided data on irrigated
    areas. Daily rainfall data from 2000 to 2014 were collected from the India Meteorological
    Department''s (IMD) Hydro Met Division website at http://imd.gov.in. The monsoon
    was the subject of our investigation. We focused our research on the monsoon season
    (kharif season) from May to December because all the agricultural activities are
    done during this season and image analysis also carried out for that season. Table
    2 Characteristics of the major river basins Full size table 4.3 Spectral matching
    techniques for identifying changes in irrigated area using NDVI The NDVI, which
    is a combination of near infrared and red bands, is frequently used to discern
    vegetation conditions such as density and vigour. NDVI values range from − 1 to + 1,
    with higher values indicating more vigorous vegetation and lower values indicating
    less vigorous vegetation. The total area irrigated from 2000–2001 to 2014–2015
    and the annual irrigated area differ significantly. The change in the irrigated
    area was discovered using spectral matching techniques. The highest mean NDVI
    value in Tamil Nadu was 0.79 during the kharif season. From this result along
    with the micro climate analysis (Temperature, Air quality index and Humidity)
    suggest the right crop for the season. 4.4 Crop management Crop management is
    the process of evaluating the sociological, ecological and economic factors that
    play a significant role in the choice, growing and selling of crops. Cropping
    patterns are influenced by crop growth, the availability of water resources, labour,
    insurance, and environmental conditions using MODIS satellite and AI. Cropping
    patterns might change according to ecological variables. For instance traditional
    crops like paddy agriculture, which require extensive water resources, cannot
    be supported in places with diminishing water supplies and groundwater tables.
    Crop choice is also influenced by the agricultural product''s market as well as
    the export and import regulations of other nations. 4.5 Soil monitoring In the
    overall farming process, soil moisture is crucial. During the course of a plant’s
    growth, it is in charge of photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration and the
    transfer of minerals [30]. In making decisions for farms, soil monitoring is crucial.
    Cropping patterns are influenced by a number of variables, including soil salinity,
    pests, precipitation, pH, and humidity. These elements support the evaluation
    of soil health. Field-based sensors track the temperature and humidity of the
    soil, and the cloud receives through LoRa Transmitter and the process the data.
    Farmers will be informed about a variety of issues, and planting patterns are
    evaluated and chosen depending on salinity content, soil nutrient level, humidity,
    and temperature. A wide range of topics will be discussed with farmers, and planting
    patterns will be considered and selected based on factors like salinity content,
    soil nutrient level, humidity, and temperature. Water is essential for photosynthesis,
    regulates temperature, and transports food and nutrients for plant growth, making
    soil moisture a crucial element in plant growth. Humidity controls the food supply
    and transpiration rate for ideal plant growth. A humidity of 50% to 60% is ideal
    for the growth of vegetable plants [32]. To ensure the best possible use of water
    resources, soil moisture sensors are inserted into plant roots and analyse soil
    moisture level measurements [33, 34]. 4.6 Smart irrigation Smart irrigation is
    the practise of enhancing the quality and quantity of production while making
    the most use of available water resources. By giving the plants the right amount
    of water, it saves water. Irrigation systems can be classified as either soil
    moisture sensor-based or weather-based. A controller controls the irrigation in
    weather-based irrigation systems, which collect temperature and rainfall data
    from a nearby small weather station. In irrigation systems using soil moisture
    sensors, sensors buried in tree grass provide precise measurements of the soil''s
    moisture content. In order to irrigate the field with this sort of irrigation,
    precise humidity and air temperature measurements, weather monitoring, and cropping
    patterns are all necessary with AI. Sprinkler actuators and data are delivered
    to the cloud together [35]. The data from the soil moisture sensor determine the
    irrigation schedule for each farm area. Maximum crop growth and 100% water utilisation
    efficiency are guaranteed by micro level analysis, scheduling, and effective actuation
    [36]. From a mobile application built for smart phones, farmers can monitor and
    may control the irrigation system. This irrigation system is based on information
    collected from field-installed temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and ultrasonic
    sensors [37]. Farmers can execute actuation by turning on the irrigation pumps
    to water the farm using a user-friendly mobile application that is built for smart
    phones and connected to the cloud for analysis. 4.7 Plant growth monitoring The
    key step after selecting a crop is crop cultivation. Modern technology is available
    to farmers and sensors installed in the field monitor plant growth. For instance,
    ultrasonic sensors. For instance, to track the presence of insects and pests that
    hinder plant growth, ultrasonic sensors are deployed in the field. When pests
    are found, high frequency sound waves are produced to eliminate them, and the
    farmer is also made aware of their presence for additional assistance [31]. 5
    Methodology and implementation Applied Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
    Machine intelligence that resembles human intelligence is known as artificial
    intelligence. Many industries, including e-commerce and marketing [38], human
    resources [39], computer vision [40], multimedia forensics [41, 42], healthcare
    [43], social media [44, 45], gaming [46, 47] and agriculture have showed great
    potential as a result of advancements in AI and ML. In agriculture, artificial
    intelligence (AI) is used to improve productivity, crop yield, and profitability
    as well as to track livestock, monitor the weather, optimise supply chains, manage
    irrigation systems, manage pesticide and fertiliser use, and control weeds. Researchers
    are using fuzzy logic, other AI/ML techniques like classification and logistic
    regression, as well as Neuro-Fuzzy logic, to improve agricultural decision-making,
    predictive analytics, and mobile expert systems [48]. Real-time monitoring of
    the environment in agricultural areas is made possible by integrating sensors
    with a microcontroller unit. The system can identify the presence of pests or
    unusual variables linked to pest attacks by deploying sensors like temperature,
    humidity and pest-specific sensors. Early identification is made possible by this
    allowing farmers to act right away and minimise any crop damage. The system may
    analyse sensor data and detect certain pest species or patterns linked to pest
    infestations by incorporating AI algorithms. The accuracy of pest identification
    can be increased over time by using AI models that have been taught to detect
    pests. The manual effort needed for pest monitoring is decreased thanks to this
    automated identification procedure which also provides prompt and precise detection.
    By utilizing LoRa the system can transmit data even in areas with poor or no network
    coverage. This is particularly valuable in rural or remote agricultural locations
    where traditional network connectivity may be limited. The agricultural system
    can transmit pest detection data via LoRa to a central server or cloud platform.
    Using LoRa technology alerts can be sent to the farmer’s mobile device as soon
    as the system detects and identifies a pest attack. These notices may contain
    details on the individual pest the intensity of the attack and suggested pest
    control measures. This makes it possible for farmers to act quickly and protect
    their crops no matter where they are. Farmers can keep informed and make informed
    decisions wherever they are thanks to remote accessibility via mobile alerts.
    According to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, pests lose between 30
    and 35 percent of India''s annual agricultural yield. By applying cutting edge
    AI solutions to this issue there is a tremendous possibility to raise our yield.
    Early pest detection allows for the use of appropriate and less-excessive pesticides
    to protect the crop, increasing crop output. Three steps make up the Process Flow
    module: Data gathering, Keras-RetinaNet-based pest detection and Pest attack density
    detection as shown in Fig. 4 Fig. 4 AI process flow for pest detection Full size
    image 5.1 Training the model We utilised a Keras-RetinaNet model to identify pest
    photos because deep learning for visual identification is becoming increasingly
    successful. Keras-RetinaNet With ResNet + FPN as the backbone for feature extraction
    and two task-specific subnetworks for classification and bounding box regression,
    Keras-RetinaNet, developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR), achieves state-of-the-art
    performance and outperforms Faster RCNN, the well-known two-stage detector [49].
    Recent studies have shown that adopting pre-trained networks and applying them
    to other datasets significantly improves performance compared to developing new
    models from scratch. This was made possible by the models’ capacity to discover
    general features applicable to a variety of computer vision tasks. On the COCO
    dataset, we used a pre-trained model with a ResNet50 backbone, and we trained
    it using our own data. To train our model, we utilised the weights “resnet50_coco_best_v2.1.0.h5”.
    We have tested a number of models throughout the course of this project and updated
    them as we discovered models that performed better. 5.2 Features Pest Detection:
    Detects pests through Keras-RetinaNet object detection model. (As explained above)
    Pest affect Density: The amount of pests found in each image is counted by the
    model. It serves as a criterion to determine how much damage has already been
    done and provides an estimate of how many pests are present on a leaf. The sensors
    and AI will begin to function according to the power supply given to the Arduino
    board in the proposed approach. A soil moisture sensor coupled to a microcontroller
    unit delivers the corresponding readings on a periodic basis, and the DHT11 sensor
    detects the temperature and humidity in the crop roots on the other end. An air
    index sensor is also used to determine the air index. The microcontroller unit''s
    primary goal is to get the data values sent by the sensors and ESP32, which was
    configured to save the data in the cloud. These values are shown on the LCD screen
    by the data that is delivered to the microcontroller. For timely irrigation, which
    supplies the necessary amount of water to the receptive crops according to the
    stages, a Direct Current (DC) Pump and a Microcontroller are employed. If the
    Arduino is turned on and all the sensors are controlled by Arduino, then all of
    the aforementioned sensors will start working at once. The Raspberry PI, AI, and
    camera that are housed in the other portion of the gadget are utilised to detect
    both pest and disease attacks. The farmer is informed if the camera detects the
    insect attack. We also offer a fertiliser calculator to help you determine how
    much fertiliser is necessary for each crop in order to control insect attacks.
    Therefore, farmers may apply the proper amount of fertilisers to the crops using
    our fertiliser calculator. We now offer a mobile application that allows you to
    examine real-time farm data in addition to the fertiliser calculator feature.
    Our mobile application pulls data from the cloud and displays it in accordance
    with what farmers are asking for. Micro climate analysis, harnessed through AI
    algorithms, offers a data-driven approach to optimize crop selection. Through
    continuous monitoring of temperature, air quality index, and humidity, AI employs
    decision trees algorithm to correlate environmental variables with crop preferences.
    For instance, decision trees analyze historical and real-time data to identify
    temperature thresholds where specific crops flourish, ensuring ideal growing conditions.
    Air quality insights guide choices, as AI recognizes crops resilient to pollutants
    or sensitive to air composition changes. Humidity data guides water-intensive
    crop selection in suitable conditions. Additionally, AI can perform clustering
    analysis, grouping areas with similar micro climates, enabling regional-specific
    crop recommendations. AI''s adaptive learning capabilities fine-tune crop recommendations
    over time, enhancing accuracy with each season’s data. 5.3 Implementing a fertilizer
    calculator with AI involves several steps 1. Collect data on crop types, soil
    characteristics, growth stages, and historical pest incidents. 2. Apply regression
    algorithms to analyze this data, correlating nutrient levels with pest occurrences.
    3. Train the AI model using historical data to predict optimal nutrient requirements
    based on crop and soil conditions. Incorporate real-time data such as weather
    forecasts and pest population trends to dynamically adjust recommendations. 4.
    Create a user-friendly Mobile App interface where farmers input crop details and
    receive AI-generated fertiliser suggestions. Integrate data from IoT devices and
    sensors for accurate, up-to-date information. 5. Regularly update and refine the
    AI model with new data to improve accuracy. 6 Results Framework of proposed work
    is variety of environmental factors including temperature, humidity, soil moisture
    and nutrient is defined. Next, select and fabricate the necessary hardware components,
    including sensors and IoT devices. Then, set up data collection and management,
    ensuring secure storage and preprocessing. Develop AI models for real-time analysis
    and visualization of data, enabling actionable insights for farmers. According
    to the suggested algorithm as depicted in Fig. 2, the sensors will start operating
    in accordance with the power supply provided to the Arduino board. The microcontroller
    unit and the soil moisture sensor are both interfaced, and the microcontroller
    unit periodically receives the corresponding readings from the soil moisture sensor.
    Along with the temperature and humidity of the microenvironment detected by the
    temperature sensor, the air index is also monitored using an air index sensor
    and NDVI time series data from MODIS Satellite for adapting the new cropping pattern.
    The main objective of the microcontroller unit is to receive the data values transmitted
    by the sensors and the LoRa transmitter, which is set up to save the data in the
    cloud. The microcontroller receives the data from the LoRa receiver and displays
    the information in the LCD screen. For timely irrigation, which supplies the necessary
    amount of water to the receptive crops according to the stages, a DC Pump and
    a Microcontroller are employed. If the Arduino is turned on and all the sensors
    are controlled by Arduino, then all of the aforementioned sensors will start working
    at once. The Raspberry PI, AI and camera that are located in the other portion
    of the gadget are utilised to detect both insect and disease attacks. The farmer
    is informed if the camera detects the insect attack. We also offer a fertiliser
    calculator to help you determine how much fertiliser is necessary for each crop
    in order to control pest attacks. So, according to our fertilizer calculator farmers
    can feed the correct quantity of fertilizers to the crops. Along with fertilizer
    calculator facility we also provide Mobile Application to view the live data of
    the farm. Our mobile application retrieves data from the cloud and shows it in
    accordance with what farmers are asking for (multilingual). Google Firebase, where
    the database is located and the web server is hosted on Apache Web Server, receives
    the data. Figures 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 display the entire prototype output

    7 Conclusion Technology advancements and the meteoric expansion of ICT have transformed
    traditional agriculture into a smart, intelligent, automated agriculture. Smart
    agriculture reduces its carbon footprint by implementing sustainable, green farming,
    limiting the use of pesticides and fertilisers, and increasing the use of natural
    resources. As was already said, smart agriculture has various challenges. To get
    around these challenges, both new and old technologies must be used. In this work,
    cloud-based AI models for smart agriculture are used. The use of advanced microcontrollers
    in hardware has expedited the shift in computing paradigm. Giving IoT devices
    intelligence is the most recent development. LoRa technology enables network accessibility.
    If the sensor data exceeds a predetermined threshold value, the microcontroller
    unit continuously examines the sensor data using AI and sends an alarm SMS to
    the mobile phone of an owner who is in a faraway place. The relevant data obtained
    from measuring the DHT11 sensor''s varied readings in a range of climatic conditions
    are used to determine the threshold value. By employing WSN nodes like LoRa for
    data transmission and database systems for local data storage, this system can
    be improved. Technology advancements and the meteoric emergence of AI have transformed
    traditional agriculture into a smart, intelligent, automated agriculture. Smart
    agriculture reduces its carbon footprint by implementing sustainable, green farming,
    limiting the use of pesticides and fertilisers, and increasing the use of natural
    resources. The agricultural industry will soon include Agriculture 5.0 [48]. By
    doing this, the system''s sustainability will be preserved as yields rise. Both
    industrialised and developing countries will follow a similar trend. From an economic
    and environmental standpoint, humanity will embrace efficient food production
    and delivery more than ever [50]. Future work of the work should prioritize sensor
    technology advancements, enhancing AI models for precision agriculture, optimizing
    energy efficiency, expanding user-friendly interfaces, promoting scalability and
    cost-efficiency. These efforts will contribute to more accurate data collection,
    better decision-making for farmers, sustainable IoT implementations, improved
    accessibility, and wider adoption of this technology, ultimately fostering increased
    agricultural productivity and sustainability. References World Health Organization

  description: Adopting and developing sustainable precision irrigation systems allows
    for improving productivity, reducing water and energy losses in agricultural fields.
    This paper deals with the development and real-time implementation of a smart
    precision irrigation system (SPIS). The proposed system combines two irrigation
    approaches, processed by a feedback fuzzy logic (FL) controller, and long-range
    data transmission and monitoring via the LoRa protocol. The combined approaches
    not only enhance overall performance but also address several limitations commonly
    associated with existing approaches. The proposed system uses the collected data
    from the sensors unit to provide the optimal irrigation decision and communicates
    it with the operator (farmer) via a developed IoT platform. Data from soil moisture,
    ambient temperature, solar irradiance, and rainfall sensors are processed through
    the FL controller to adjust the irrigation times. The inputs and outputs are fuzzified
    by trapezoidal and triangular membership functions. Mamdani's fuzzy inference
    is used to control the system through a set of linguistic control rules for a
    more accurate decision for each scenario. The field experimentation of the developed
    SPIS in the eastern region of Morocco shows high efficiency and reliability by
    saving water and energy compared to traditional irrigation control. The proposed
    system, with remote data monitoring, promotes better management of irrigation,
    water, and energy consumption, and it is suitable to be mounted with any type
    of irrigation installation in the field, without extensive modifications.

    logicWater savingEnergy saving 1. Introduction Agriculture is considered a key
    issue of national development due to the important economic, social, and territorial
    stakes of this sector (Knox et al., 2012). In Morocco, agriculture is the first
    contributor to the gross domestic product (GDP) with a variation of 11 % to 18
    %, which is mainly influenced by climatic conditions. Moreover, Moroccan agriculture
    employs nearly half of the active population and provides 23 % of the nation''s
    exports1. In 2022–2023, water scarcity in Morocco is considered a major concern
    as water reserves have been reduced by 59 %, which exposes them to spatial and
    temporal irregularity issues. Fig. 1 (a) shows the rainfall deficit percentage
    and Fig. 1 (b) shows the drought index of January 2023 in Moroccan regions2. Given
    the enormous evolution of irrigated agricultural areas that consume huge amounts
    of water, the unpredictability of rainfall may lead to increasing and deepening
    the problem of water availability and the failure to meet the irrigation needs
    of crops, resulting in rising drought areas and a decline in agricultural productivity.
    One of the factors contributing to this is the use of permanent alimentation solenoids
    to activate irrigation systems and low performance irrigation approaches (Avşar
    et al., 2018, Le et al., 2020). These solenoids require a continuous power supply,
    leading to increased energy demands. The reliance on such solenoids is prevalent
    in various agricultural processes, including irrigation systems, crop harvesting
    machinery, and automated greenhouse controls. The constant power requirements
    of these solenoids contribute significantly to the overall energy consumption
    in the agricultural sector, further straining the already limited resources. Addressing
    this issue and exploring alternative energy-efficient solutions could mitigate
    the environmental impact and reduce the sector''s overall energy consumption.

    Fig. 1. (a) The rainfall deficit percentage (%), (b) The drought index of January
    2023 of Morocco. For the agricultural areas of eastern Morocco, irrigation water
    and energy losses are generally caused by two factors: the first factor is the
    manual control of the pump and valves in the pressurised irrigation system. According
    to Hamami and Nassereddine, 2020, Xie et al., 2022, the inefficiency of these
    irrigation systems extends beyond Morocco and has been observed in other regions
    as well. The studies highlight that these traditional irrigation systems, which
    rely on manual pump activation, contribute to significant losses in irrigation
    water and energy. These findings suggest that the low efficiency of such systems
    is not limited to a specific geographical area but is a widespread issue that
    affects multiple agricultural regions (Kumar et al., 2023). In those cases, farmers
    use their prior knowledge of crop response, or by observing leaf stress, to determine
    the duration of irrigation. This technique cannot be relied upon since it does
    not reflect the actual water needs of the plants, which are related to the growth
    stage and weather conditions (Jaafar et al., 2021). On the other hand, the second
    factor is the losses due to the process in which irrigation water is released
    into the atmosphere as vapor, caused mainly by the high temperature and solar
    irradiance rates. This factor can be solved by using drip irrigation methods,
    but it is also necessary to adopt advanced control techniques. The development
    and design of smart precision irrigation systems and mechanisms with the use of
    IoT technologies for the visualization and monitoring of different parameters
    of agriculture and irrigation is the key solution to managing irrigation water
    resources efficiently and sustainably by delivering the exact amount of water
    required by the crop (Capraro Fuentes et al., 2018). In addition, optimizing the
    energy supplied to operate the various actuators (Qaisar et al., 2021, Mellit
    et al., 2021). Irrigation systems are classified into two categories according
    to their control, open-loop and closed-loop control systems. Open-loop control,
    also called no-feedback control, is a type of controller that generates decisions
    based on the current state, i.e., it has no feedback to determine if the assessed
    input has achieved the desired objective, in our case satisfying the crop''s water
    needs with precision while considering climatic-soil conditions (Navarro-Hellín
    et al., 2016). Therefore, an open-loop irrigation system cannot be reliably used
    to deal with the challenges of precision irrigation. Programmable irrigation controller,
    also called irrigation timers are among the systems based on this control technique.
    The scheduling of the period and duration of the irrigation remains constant without
    knowing the real needs of irrigation in the crop. Closed-loop control systems
    are the most efficient and robust in terms of decision support and allow for precision
    irrigation (Bwambale et al., 2022). The action depends on the output provided
    by the system; the input varies according to the output, which produces a more
    accurate decision. The feedback loop also allows for automatic adjustments to
    be made in real time, which improve the accuracy, stability and performance of
    irrigation decisions. Sensor units are used to provide this feedback to the processing
    unit. According to agriculture experts and scientific research, three approaches
    are distinguished (Abioye et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2020). The first approach
    is based on the measurement of soil moisture, which indicates the amounts of water
    consumed and absorbed by the crop during a period, and then decides on the scheduling
    of future irrigation times by setting a percentage of soil moisture, so the irrigation
    system works until it reaches the set value of moisture (Soulis et al., 2015).
    An intelligent urban irrigation system is discussed in (Mason et al., 2019) aiming
    at decreasing water use without reducing crop yield. The system includes a wireless
    soil moisture sensor network and controllable valves and tested in nine climatic
    regions of the contiguous United States. Tomatoes are chosen due to their sensitivity
    to water stress. The second approach is to control irrigation according to the
    evolution of the meteorological conditions (Kool et al., 2014). The measurement
    of environmental variables in real time such as: air temperature and humidity,
    solar irradiance and wind speed allows estimating the reference evapotranspiration
    level (ET0) (Chiew et al., 1995), which indicates the water losses suffered by
    the plant and the soil (J. Doorenbos et al., 1976). Weather stations or IoT-based
    sensor networks are used to provide such information. In (González-Briones et
    al., 2018), a monitoring system able to collect various data on its environment,
    by sensing temperature, solar irradiance, pH, humidity, and wind speed is presented.
    The objective of this research is to build virtual organizations of agents based
    on several master and slave nodes that are connected to ensure data exchange from
    sensors while monitoring the crops. The development of a platform (IoT) with a
    fibrous capillary irrigation system based on the climatic demand estimated by
    the weather condition was reported by (Abd Rahman et al., 2019). The experiment
    has been conducted using a Choy sum plant as a test crop in a greenhouse. Demand
    tracking, management of the irrigation system, and the use of weather information
    allowed for near real-time estimation of the crop''s water requirements, which
    also allowed the monitoring of the progress of water consumption by the plants.
    The last approach is the survey of the plant evolution parameters, such crop water
    stress index (CWSI), which determine the water needs of the plant, through the
    measurement of canopy temperature. Most irrigation systems are based on simple
    control techniques and algorithms (Davis, and Dukes, 2010; Singh et al., 2023),
    containing a single input or a threshold value to be set by the operator to decide
    on starting or ending the irrigation. The reliability and efficiency of those
    controls’ techniques are limited and unable to reliably schedule irrigation since
    precision irrigation involves the evaluation and processing of multiple inputs.
    Fuzzy logic (FL) is one of the intelligent control techniques that allow to manipulation
    of multiple input variables while taking account of the output action. So, it
    is more suitable for non-linear systems due to its flexibility in data processing
    and it is very effective for decision-making problems that require precision (Zadeh,
    1999). The operation of fuzzy logic has been thoroughly tested in a diverse and
    challenging field (Yahyaoui et al., 2017). It is structured with three main modules,
    a fuzzification module, an inference engine, and a defuzzification module. Mamdani
    and Sugeno are the two popular approaches in FL (Omomule et al., 2020, Shafaei
    et al., 2017), each with its own distinct characteristics. The key difference
    lies in how they handle the fuzzy rule’s consequences. In Mamdani-FL, the output
    membership function is a fuzzy set representing the degree of membership of the
    output variable. This allows for linguistic descriptions, where the output can
    be interpreted in terms of linguistic terms (Pourjavad et al., 2019). On the other
    hand, Sugeno-FL employs a more mathematical approach, where the output is represented
    as a crisp value or a mathematical function of the input variables. This enables
    precise numerical calculations and facilitates mathematical modelling. The advantage
    of the Mamdani-FL lies in its ability to incorporate linguistic rules and provide
    interpretable outputs. By using linguistic terms, the system''s behaviour becomes
    more understandable and intuitive to humans, making it suitable for applications
    where transparency and explainability are crucial. It allows experts to easily
    define rules using their domain knowledge and linguistic terms, making it a powerful
    tool in decision-making processes (Hamam et al., 2008). Additionally, Mamdani-FL
    supports a wide range of inference methods and can handle complex and nonlinear
    systems effectively. While Sugeno-FL has its own advantages, such as its computational
    efficiency and ability to handle mathematical modelling, the interpretability
    and linguistic-based nature of Mamdani-FL make it a preferred choice in agriculture
    applications (Urbieta Parrazales et al., 2021). A FL-based irrigation controller
    is designed and integrated into a field in India, to perform multi-criteria decision-making,
    this allows to select of the most efficient and adequate irrigation sub-system
    (Yilmaz and Harmancioglu et al., 2010). Another application of FL has been reported
    in (Krishnan et al., 2020). The objective is to automatically control the irrigation
    through the measurement of soil moisture to decide the necessary flow for irrigation.
    Six fuzzy rules have been implemented. DC motor is activated in cases where the
    soil moisture value is between medium and very low values, otherwise the contrary.
    The modelling and simulation of a fuzzy irrigation system have been presented
    in (Mushtaq et al., 2016). The approach is based on the calculation of ET by a
    fuzzy inference system. The input variables are temperature, humidity, wind, and
    solar radiation. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the fuzzy system
    in accurately determining and compensating the water loss due to ET. Another work
    (Kurniawan et al., 2017) presented the combination of a prediction algorithm and
    fuzzy control. The combination of fertilization and irrigation precisely to reduces
    the amount of irrigation water and the waste of chemical fertilizers. This results
    in further saving and reducing production costs and improving agricultural efficiency.
    In our previous work (Benzaouia et al., 2021) we developed an intelligent irrigation
    system based on FL controller for the automatic watering of agricultural areas
    (Oriental Morocco). The simulation results proved that the irrigation system allows
    to keep the soil moisture measurements higher than the value specified by the
    user and eliminates the under-irrigation risk. In the presented research works,
    the utilization of FL is primarily focused on simple applications. These applications
    involve employing fuzzy sets and membership functions to handle vague or uncertain
    data and make decisions based on fuzzy reasoning. Moreover, a noteworthy aspect
    of these works is the use of minimal control rules, implying that the number of
    rules employed in the fuzzy logic systems is kept to a minimum. In the realm of
    modern field management, it is crucial not only to adopt advanced control systems
    but also to incorporate communication IoT protocols to enable seamless data transmission
    and enhanced control. The integration of IoT offers numerous benefits, including
    real-time data acquisition, remote monitoring, and improved decision-making capabilities.
    Various communication technologies, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and others,
    can be utilized to establish reliable connections in field management applications.
    Table 1 provides a summary of these technologies and their application for irrigation
    monitoring, outlining their respective ranges and power consumption. The common
    characteristic among these technologies is their low data transmission range.
    However, in the case of large agricultural areas, it becomes necessary to employ
    technologies that can cover vast distances with improved sending capabilities
    which makes them very limited. LoRa technology stands out as one of the promising
    solutions that has proven its effectiveness in various industrial applications
    (Kaur et al., 2022), additionally, in fields such as telemedicine (Ayat et al.,
    2023). It offers several advantages for IoT applications, its long-range capability
    allows for communication over large distances, while its low power consumption
    ensures minimizing energy consumption. The cost-effectiveness of LoRa, coupled
    with its scalability and secure communication features, also makes it suitable
    for large-scale deployments. The flexibility of LoRa enables its use in diverse
    environments, and its open standard promotes interoperability. Table 1. IoT technologies

    smart precision irrigation system with a combined weather-soil approach is proposed
    and designed, to efficiently schedule the irrigation of apple trees in fields
    located in the eastern region of Morocco. Soil moisture, ambient temperature,
    solar irradiance, and rainfall are the inputs of the FL controller. They are sensed
    through different sensors, and subsequently transmitted to apply the well-designed
    fuzzy rules for irrigation control, while the output is the duration and timing
    of irrigation which depends on the crop requirements in the field. This allows
    for optimizing the soil water content, enhancing plant health and product quality.
    The system also includes a long-range LoRa communication module for wireless transmission
    and a developed IoT platform for visualization and monitoring to enhance the mentioned
    drawbacks of discussed IoT techniques in irrigation. The techno-economic study
    between the proposed system in the literature and the one available on the commercial
    market, proved the reliability of the proposed SPIS to manage the irrigation process
    in a precise and intelligent manner with low-cost installation. This is the first
    research study reported on the design of an intelligent precision irrigation system
    adapted to the eastern climate of Morocco. The main contributions of the paper
    can be summarized as follows: • The design of an automated intelligent irrigation
    controller based on FL inference that evolves in real-time the weather-soil monitoring
    approach to decide the optimal irrigation time and impulse solenoid-valve opening.
    The system is highly efficient and tested in an agricultural field under real
    scenarios. • The development of a real-time visualization and monitoring IoT platform
    for irrigation and field data such as system status, soil moisture, air humidity,
    ambient temperature, solar irradiance, irrigation time, energy, water consumption,
    etc. • Provide a reliable and efficient irrigation system at a low cost. The article
    is organized as follows, Section 2 presents the design and control of the proposed
    irrigation system. Section 3 describes the operating steps of the system. Section
    4 discusses the software and hardware implementation. The experimental performance
    evaluation and the techno-economic study are given in Section 5. Conclusion and
    future improvement are reported in the last Section 6. 2. Design and control of
    the proposed irrigation system The structure of the proposed smart precision irrigation
    system based on an effective strategy that combines both weather and soil approaches
    is given in Fig. 2. It consists of five essential sub-systems: (1) the sensors
    unit, (2) the controller unit, (3) the irrigation unit, (4) the IoT communication
    unit, and finally (5) the power unit. A detailed description of the methodology
    of the development of these subsystems is given in the following sections. Download

    The structure of the smart precision irrigation system. 2.1. Location and specification
    of the study field An agricultural field situated around the eastern region of
    Morocco has been selected to carry out the experimentation of the developed irrigation
    system (See Fig. 3). The location and global positioning are a latitude of 34.811835
    and a longitude of −1.967141 (34°48′42.6″N 1°58′01.7″W). Download : Download high-res
    image (271KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Geographical view of
    the field of experimentation. The field is divided into three areas (A), (B) and
    (C). The focus is only on the A and B zones, the irrigation system in the first
    zone (A) is controlled by the proposed smart precision irrigation system and the
    second zone (B) temporised controller is used. Note that the area A and B are
    about 1300 m2 for each and contain about 140 apple trees, with an irrigated surface
    approximately 100 m2. The experiment region exhibits a unique semi-arid climate
    influenced by its geographical location and topography. Situated in the eastern
    part of the country, this region experiences distinct climatic conditions that
    have significant implications for agriculture and socio-economic activities. The
    climate can be classified as Mediterranean with semi-arid characteristics. It
    is characterized by hot and dry summers with limited rainfall and mild, wet winters.
    The region is known for its high temperatures during the summer months, often
    exceeding 40 °C (104°F). Additionally, the area experiences high ET rates due
    to the combination of high temperatures and limited rainfall, resulting in the
    loss of water from both the soil and vegetation. Precipitation is moderate, with
    most rainfall occurring between October and April. However, there is considerable
    variability in precipitation patterns, leading to occasional drought conditions.
    The unique semi-arid climate of the region plays a crucial role in shaping agricultural
    practices, water resource management, and overall livelihoods in the area. 2.2.
    Sensors unit The sensors unit consists of specific field sensors for soil moisture
    measurement, and climatic sensors for measuring ambient temperature, relative
    air humidity, solar irradiance, and rainfall. All the used sensors are calibrated
    to prevent any drift that could be generated during their operation. 2.2.1. Soil
    moisture sensing Soil moisture information is extremely important for the control
    and scheduling of irrigation periods. It allows to identify the characteristics
    of diffusion or storage of water in a defined soil, which is usually influenced
    by its composition and texture (sandy, clayey and silty soil). There are two main
    techniques for determining soil moisture, the direct method and the indirect method.
    The direct method, known as gravimetric, consists of drying a soil sample and
    then determining the weight of the water contained in the sample. This method
    is not adapted to real-time applications and remains expensive. Indirect methods
    consist in measuring the electrical conductivity or the dielectric permittivity
    of the soil and then converted to volumetric soil water content. For this application,
    a UM-MS-10 sensor is selected. This sensor is dedicated to precision irrigation
    applications while offering very accurate measurements, and a high sensitivity
    to amounts of water applied to the soil with a low error range (about ± 2 % and
    ± 4 % for a water content between 0 and 53 % and 53–100 % respectively), in addition
    to the possibility of calibration for specific soils. Determining the number of
    soil moisture sensors is based on several factors, including the size and nature
    of the area being monitored, the type of crops, the depth of the root zone, the
    soil properties, and the way that the area is exposed to weather variations. In
    our research focused on apple trees, a case study to examine soil moisture levels
    in zone A has been conducted firstly. Multiple sensors have been strategically
    placed at different locations within the zone to capture comprehensive data. The
    analysis revealed consistently low measurement errors, attributable to the soil''s
    homogeneity and absence of geographical irregularities. Consequently, a single
    sensor has been selected and positioned at a depth of 0.3 m. This depth is justified
    based on the relevant findings reported in our previous research (Benzaouia et
    al., 2021). To ensure the generalizability of our results across the entire field,
    further investigations are planned. These subsequent examinations will involve
    subdividing the field into smaller zones, allowing for the optimization of sensor
    placement, and determining the minimum number of sensors required for accurate
    soil moisture assessments. This approach enhances the scientific rigor of the
    study and provides valuable insights into the spatial variability of soil moisture.
    2.2.2. Ambient temperature sensing As temperatures increase toward limit values,
    the plants'' ET rates increase and the water balance of the soil decreases, therefore
    the scheduling of irrigation according to temperature variations is also crucial.
    The DHT-11 sensor is a reliable sensor for measuring ambient temperature and relative
    humidity, requiring no external calibration, and able to measure temperatures
    from −40 to + 125 °C with an accuracy of ± 0.5 °C and relative humidity ranges
    from 0 to 100 % with an accuracy of ± 2 %. 2.2.3. Solar irradiance sensing Solar
    irradiance is a source of energy that comes from a thermal process, which also
    contributes to the evaporation process. So, it is important to schedule irrigation
    during a period of minimal solar irradiance. Several devices are available to
    measure and quantify the intensity of solar irradiance, including pyrometer, LDR,
    photoristor and others. However, most of them are expensive and usually require
    an adapter to exploit the collected data. For economic and technical reasons,
    a BH1750 sensor has been selected to estimate solar irradiance intensity. It allows
    a measurement range from 1 lx to 100.000 lx, with an error of ± 3 % for low and
    high ranges, additionally to its robustness against IR radiation (Very small effect
    of IR radiation). 2.2.4. Rainfall sensing To save the water and energy consumption
    of the proposed irrigation system in the agricultural field in case of precipitation,
    a rain sensor or rain switch is integrated, allowing the detection of rainfall.
    Hence, if the feedback received from the sensor indicates the availability of
    high rates of rainfall, the system is turned off and the irrigation periods are
    rescheduled by referring to fuzzy logic rules. 2.3. Controller unit The controller
    is held responsible for intelligent data processing for irrigation scheduling,
    and the generation of the output control signal, namely the duration, time, and
    period of irrigation unit opening and activation which is decided by FL programmed
    and implemented in ATmega2560 microcontroller. In addition, this unit is responsible
    for receiving and transmitting time-series data from the sensor’s unit to the
    developed visualization and monitoring platform. 2.3.1. Mathematical modeling
    The proposed FL controller is composed of three key components, namely the fuzzification
    module, the inference engine, and the defuzzification module, as illustrated in
    Fig. 4. The system operates by developing a universe of discourse ( ) that entails
    a membership function and defining an interval of ( ) represented by . In this
    context, is characterized as a membership function that comprises a set of ordered
    pairs of elements and the probability that e belongs to ( ), as described by Pazouki
    et al., 2021. Download : Download high-res image (171KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Flow-chart of FL inference-based irrigation controller. The system
    requires three input parameters, namely soil moisture (SM), temperature (T), and
    solar irradiance (SR). Each of these parameters comprises three membership functions
    that are identified by a fuzzy subset of ( ). Specifically, variable represents
    soil moisture, variable represents temperature, and variable represents solar
    irradiance. The degree to which a given value of belongs to variables , , and
    is expressed by the membership functions , and . Equations (2), (3) respectively
    provide the fuzzy intersection and union set for the three variables. The purpose
    of the fuzzification step is to transform a digital input obtained from a sensor
    into a linguistic variable by means of membership functions. A membership function
    can be defined as a function that specifies the degree of membership of a numerical
    input to a linguistic variable. In this context, the membership function employed
    regulates a variety of parameters, including fluctuations in soil moisture, temperature,
    and solar irradiance. The proposed irrigation system commonly employs triangular
    and trapezoidal membership functions to make appropriate decisions. Equations
    (4), (5) depict the triangular and trapezoidal shapes, respectively, for a three-value
    fuzzification system. Fig. 5 illustrates the membership functions for both the
    inputs and outputs of the FL controller. (2) (3) (4) (5) Download : Download high-res
    image (340KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Inputs and output membership
    functions. The fuzzy inference process involves the interpretation of input values
    gathered from sensors, which are then utilized to determine output values based
    on sets of rules. To accomplish this, a set of if-then rules has been formulated
    to operate with the membership functions of each input. The literature describes
    two types of fuzzy inference systems that can be implemented: Mamdani type and
    Sugano type. The Mamdani type has been selected for the proposed irrigation system
    because it is well-suited for expert system applications. In each given scenario,
    the output of the controller is represented by the irrigation duration, time and
    periods which varies in accordance with the fuzzy rules grouped in Table 2, Table
    3, and Table 4. Table 2. Rules of the output (duration of irrigation in min) for
    dry soil. Temperature (°C) Solar irradiance (%) Dark Medium Light Cold Very Long

    Zero In the process of implementing an intelligent irrigation strategy, defuzzification
    serves as the final step. After fuzzification, the rules are applied to generate
    a fuzzy output which is subsequently transformed into a scalar quantity. The selection
    of the centroid defuzzification method has been based on its precision in producing
    reliable outputs. Equation (6) expresses the defuzzified output ( ). (6) 2.3.2.
    Simulation and validation of proposed system A preliminary simulation of the irrigation
    system has been carried out using the FL toolbox available in the Matlab/Simulink
    environment in order to build the fuzzy rules for each irrigation scenario and
    verify the system responses. The fuzzy rules are based on Mamdani''s “if-then”
    conditions. The 3D graphical representation of the temperature and soil moisture
    variables as a function of the irrigation time is given in Fig. 6. It is clear
    that the system allows the irrigation process with variable duration according
    to the parameters of the plants, the soil, and the weather conditions. Download

    3D Fuzzy logic graph of rules. 2.4. Irrigation unit The irrigation unit is composed
    of an impulse solenoid and diaphragm valve, distribution pipes, and emitters.
    The solenoid is controlled through the output signal provided by the controller
    unit. The opening time and duration can be adjusted according to the decision
    of the FL controller and vary depending on the conditions affecting the irrigation.
    The efficiency of the system is considered. For this purpose, a flow meter is
    located next to the valve to measure the water consumption in the distribution
    line. Moreover, the overall energy consumed during the operation under the adopted
    irrigation strategy is calculated from the installed voltage and current sensors.
    The obtained values are used to calculate the energy consumed per time unit. 2.5.
    LoRa based IoT communication unit In order to closely monitor the status of the
    irrigation system and to visualize the evolution of the parameters related to
    precision irrigation to fulfil the customer''s display requirements, ten parameters
    are displayed in a developed platform (See Fig. 7). This platform allows to follow
    in real-time the evolution of each parameter as well as the implementation of
    alerts (e-mail, telegram, and SMS) in case of failure (problems at the level of
    the sensors, condition on the irrigation parameters), moreover the transversal
    communication between the hardware and software part. The main page that is displayed
    contains an indication of the status of the system (on/off), the air temperature,
    the soil moisture, the soil temperature, the electrical conductivity, and the
    salinity. The irrigation duration provided by the FL controller, the evolution
    of the solar irradiance (the parameter is displayed as a percentage just to simplify
    the display) during each day is also displayed, and finally, the water flow rate
    distributed to the plant for each irrigation decision. An example of visualization

    frameworks, and a hardware environment containing boards with microcontrollers
    for processing as well as different communication shields for sending and receiving
    data, Fig. 9 represents the conception of each environment. Django is chosen given
    the multiple advantages that it presents, namely the robust development language
    Python, the ability to run with any client-side infrastructure, return data in
    any format namely HTML, RSS, JSON, XML, and provides robust security features
    that avoid common security errors (Srivastava et al., 2021). MySQL database is
    chosen as a manager owing to its many advantages in terms of rapidity, and ability
    to perform various operations using interfaces written in C, C++, Python, Java
    and PHP (Rao et al., 2014). The configuration of the manager is done at the Django
    framework level. Download : Download high-res image (247KB) Download : Download

    communication between the HTTP client and the platform is done through an API,
    which allows to interface and translate the requests received by the HTTP client
    to the server and return a response to the clients (when the Rest-API has what
    it needs, it sends back a response to the clients, typically be in JSON or XML
    format) (Ong et al., 2015). ATmega2560 programming is based on the Processing
    IDE and programmed with Arduino IDE software. The code is called a sketch and
    the assembly of several for functionalities are called libraries, which simplifies
    the user''s programming tasks by hiding the code in the libraries as a “black
    box”. The ATmega2560 can be programmed within the limits of 256 Kb of Flash memory
    with a clock rate of 16 MHz, moreover in this application of the smart precision
    irrigation system, it is autonomously working without being connected to an interface
    (computer) for control exchange. 2.6. Power unit The power consumption of the
    controller and sensor units, which represent a node in the proposed SPIS, is presented
    in Table 5. Specifically, the sensor unit consumes approximately 1.3 mA. Current
    investigations are being conducted to test the effectiveness of using small batteries
    to power this node. Based on initial estimations, two batteries of 6600 mAh associated
    in parallel could potentially provide a supply duration of around 1 year. This
    allows for reliable data collection with long-range capabilities and the ability
    to record hourly data. Table 5. Current consumption of the proposed system. Sensor

    the primary goal is to gather precise and comprehensive data. To achieve this,
    an integrated system that relies on a PV panel for power supply coupled with batteries.
    3. Operating steps of the proposed irrigation system The operating steps of the
    proposed system are shown in Fig. 10. In the first step, the precipitation status
    is checked, if the sensor indicates that availability, the system is turned off,
    otherwise the system proceeds to the next step of sensing the values received
    by the sensor unit hourly (ambient temperature, solar irradiation and soil moisture).
    The time and duration of irrigation is given after applying the appropriately
    designed fuzzy rules by reasoning according to the information from these sensors.

    Fig. 10. Operating steps of the proposed irrigation system. In this study, the
    information generated by the soil moisture sensor indicates the requirement for
    irrigation. According to the expert of agriculture, the optimal threshold of soil
    moisture for apple tree’s is 30 %. Therefore, the measurement of this variable
    is taken into account in this study. For each situation and variation of the input
    variables of the FL controller, the result is determined by the rules summarized
    in tables 2,3 and 4. Some real scenarios examples are given as follow: • If the
    soil is wet, i.e. exceeds 30 %, and regardless of the values of solar irradiance
    and ambient temperature, the irrigation decision is given by a duration equal
    to zero. • If the soil moisture equals 30 %, and regardless the value of all input
    variables, the system remains turned off, with a null irrigation duration decision.
    • If the soil contains an average soil moisture value, with an average temperature
    and solar irradiance, then the irrigation duration is set to very short duration.
    • If the soil is dry with a high temperature and a minimum solar irradiance, the
    duration is set to zero, since the high temperatures generate an increase in evaporation
    and water loses. In the area where the experiment is conducted, the process of
    water aspiration through the soil has been estimated at 60 min. This duration
    is based on experimental measurements for a well-known soil constitution. The
    system is programmed to restart the same sequences, which justifies the frequency
    of sending data to the platform. 4. Software and hardware implementation The FL
    controller has been implemented in real-time through a code in C language adapted
    with ATmega2560 microcontroller, the structure of the code is given as follows:
    firstly, a declaration of the libraries to be used, namely that of the FL, the
    sensors used, the actuators (relay) that is used to control the impulse solenoid
    and the display. After acquiring the data, the processing by fuzzy controllers
    begins. The fuzzy logic code is devised in three parts, first is the design of
    the membership functions by using equations (4), (5) on each of the three inputs
    (soil moisture, ambient temperature, and solar irradiance) and defining the variation
    ranges. Secondly the design of the fuzzy rules, in our case 27 rules are implemented.
    The last part is the defuzzification, which consists in assigning the results
    to the output in the form of linguistic variable to be exploited afterwards. The
    output being the duration and the time of irrigation, this value is converted
    into control signal form to activate the relay that enables to activate the electro
    valve and pump to start the irrigation process. The controller is programmed to
    repeat the same sequences every hour, the program performs and schedule automatically
    the duration and times of irrigation periods without any human intervention. The
    communication between the control unit (ATmega2560), the sensors unit, the irrigation
    unit and the IoT platform is realized via the ESP32 development board by sending
    instructions. The SPIS prototype is shown in Fig. 11, and the irrigation unit
    is shown in Fig. 12. The control unit, which provides decisions, and the sensor
    unit are assembled in a case with an IP67 degree of protection. After receiving
    the decision from the FL controller, an electric control signal is sent back to
    the solenoid. It should be noted that the solenoid is impulse driven, i.e., for
    switching on and off states, it is sufficient to send only one impulse for micro-seconds.
    The operation of the solenoid according to the time decided by the proposed fuzzy
    controller, operates on the internal membrane of the valve. The component list
    used in its conception is summarized in Table 6. Download : Download high-res

    in the agricultural area (A), are presented in Fig. 14, Fig. 15, Fig. 16, Fig.
    17. The experimentation has been conducted over ten days of two different seasons,
    the summer of 2022 and the winter of 2023, this allowed to obtain an overview
    of the behaviour of the system as well as to perform a test under different meteorological
    variations in order to approve the efficiency of the adopted soil-weather approach.

    data for the summer period from 05/09/2022 to 14/09/2022 are presented in Fig.
    14 (a) The data are sensed hourly and consist of temperature (T) and solar irradiance
    (G) measurements. The highest and lowest temperatures are 37.72 °C and 15.32 °C
    respectively. The solar irradiance values vary from 0 to 1000 W/m2, indicating
    the intensity of solar radiation received during each hour. It can be observed
    that lower solar irradiance values occur during the night-time hours, indicating
    the absence of sunlight. As the day progresses, the solar irradiance values increase,
    reaching their peak at 1000 W/m2. The temperature fluctuations correlate with
    the solar irradiance values, as higher solar irradiance leads to higher temperatures.
    The collected data from the sensor unit of the SPIS have been cross validated
    with the measurements obtained from a trusted meteorological station. These validations
    have confirmed the accuracy of the collected data, with minimal margin of error.
    During the 10-day performance evaluation, it can be observed that the FL controller
    effectively avoids operating the system during periods of high temperatures and
    intense solar radiation, as depicted in Fig. 14 (b) and Fig. 14 (c) and decides
    on short durations when input variables are medium. This strategy significantly
    contributes to the reduction of ET losses throughout the day. Additionally, by
    referring to the well-designed fuzzy rules, the FL controller selects the appropriate
    timing and duration for system operation. Consequently, the actual soil moisture
    closely tracks the desired value of 30 % with smooth oscillations (See Fig. 14
    (d)), in contrast to traditional single input- single output (SISO) feedback systems
    that often result in low irrigation performance. This performance evaluation over
    the 10-day period demonstrates the effectiveness and improved performance of the
    FL in maintaining optimal soil moisture levels while minimizing water loss. An
    extensive performance analysis has been conducted on two specific days of summer
    period (13 and 14 September), to understand the overall operation of the SPIS
    (See Fig. 15). September 13th (13/09/2022) represents the operational conditions
    of the system that persist throughout the 10-day experimental period in September
    (summer). By observing the system''s performance on this day, valuable insights
    can be gained regarding its sustained operation throughout the experiment. In
    addition, September 14th (14/09/2022) has been chosen due to the presence of precipitation.
    This provides an opportunity to assess the system''s performance under the same
    conditions (high weather parameters variation), but with the added factor of precipitation.
    Analysing its behaviour on a day with precipitation allows for an evaluation of
    the system''s ability to cope with such weather conditions. Throughout the selected
    two-days observation period, it is evident that the FL-based irrigation system
    allowed for considerable irrigation durations during periods of minimal variation
    in meteorological conditions as seen in point A (See Fig. 15). However, it effectively
    avoided irrigation during high-temperature and solar radiation conditions, as
    observed in point B. Consequently, the system reprograms the irrigation decision
    until conditions reached minimal or intermediate values. These decisions have
    been automatically made by the system based on fuzzy rules summarized in Table
    2, Table 3 of section 2.3. Given the high hourly ET rate during the observed period
    in point B, it was apparent that the amount of water applied during irrigation
    would be lost to the air without benefiting the crops. This finding aligns with
    expert recommendations on irrigation practices. In the case of point C, where
    soil moisture is about 24 % and the solar irradiance variable is at a minimum
    value (G = 17 w/m2) while the temperature in a medium value (T = 29 °C), the irrigation
    duration is decided as medium. This approach effectively minimized losses in terms
    of ET. A similar decision was observed in point F, where G = 330 w/m2 and T =
    24 °C. The system consistently made the decision to withhold irrigation when soil
    moisture reached the pre-defined value set by the farmer. This is being observed
    in multiple points during the experimental days, particularly at points D. Additionally,
    the system maintained the same decision (null duration of irrigation) in the presence
    of precipitation, as observed in points E. The average applied amount of water
    for the first day was 529,6L, over the irrigated area which is approximately 100
    m2. It follows that the proposed FL-irrigation control system provides appropriate
    duration to the irrigation unit of the field to apply an average of 5.29L/day/m2,
    that is, 5.29 mm/day. This is similar to the daily estimated ET value using the
    Penman-Monteith FAO model, which is about 5.31 mm/day (according to data collected
    from the sensor unit). Similarly for the second day, the system permit applying
    an average of 471,4L/day/m2, while the ET value is about 4,73 mm/day. The proposed
    irrigation-based soil-weather approaches have been verified under summer period,
    the FL controller avoids applying water during periods when there are significant
    variations in weather conditions (See Fig. 16), this avoids the loss of water
    through evaporation processes, while keeping the plants in a better condition,
    i.e., no stress. In addition, as noted, the duration of irrigation varies depending
    on the conditions measured by the sensors, namely, soil moisture, ambient temperature,
    solar radiation, air humidity and rainfall. 5.2. Inter period Likewise, the obtained
    results during the winter period over 10 days (From 11/01/2023 to 20/01/2023)
    show that the irrigation system is operating in efficient mode and compensates
    the quantities of water required by the plants while considering the values of
    solar irradiance and temperature which are practically small and average during
    this period. A daily average of 1.98 mm/day, has been applied to the soil, which
    permits maintaining a soil moisture close to the predefined value of soil moisture
    30 % defined by the user (See Fig. 17). During this period, the system considers
    the presence of rainfall rates, to minimize the over-irrigation that influence
    the plants. The evolution of soil moisture is shown in Fig. 17 (d). It is remarkable
    that this variable reaches maximums of about 48 % since the precipitation rate
    are important. The duration and period of irrigation are always optimized during
    the variations of solar irradiance and temperature (See Fig. 17 (b) and Fig. 17
    (c)). The system avoids applying water to the plants during the night period,
    this is justified by the minimal ET rate during this period, and low irradiance
    and temperatures values therefore the irrigation durations are at mid-days. In
    summary, the aforementioned results indicate that the proposed irrigation system
    based on the soil-weather approach and fuzzy concept effectively compensates water
    losses in semi-arid regions where the experiment has been conducted, ensuring
    optimal hydration for well-watered and actively growing crops. The SPIS also has
    the capability to adjust water requirements according to weather conditions that
    influence the irrigation process, thereby facilitating improved irrigation management.
    Achieving a forecast of irrigation duration for several days would entail the
    creation of suitable artificial intelligence algorithms, such as artificial neural
    networks (ANN), long term short memory (LSTM), and support vector machines (SVM)
    which can be trained using extensive data collected through the SPIS. At present,
    our team is actively engaged in the development of these algorithms, as well as
    expanding the system to cover larger agricultural areas. 5.3. Water and energy
    consumption analysis The energy and water consumption at the level of the “irrigation
    unit” in the ‘A’ and ‘B’ areas of the experiment field have been carried out.
    It should be noted that the ''A'' area is furnished with drip irrigation pipes,
    along with the proposed SPIS and an impulse solenoid valve, and ‘B’ area is equipped
    only with a manual drip irrigation based commercial timer to preset the applied
    water flow and period which are performed according to the knowledge and visualisation
    of the water-stress on the leaves by the farmer. It is noted also that the ‘B’
    area contains a classical solenoid, which require a significant current to maintain
    the On state compared to the adopted impulse solenoid. During the summer period,
    the farmer refers to a commercial timer to regulate a fixed water flow rate of
    approximately 11 mm/day for ‘B’ area. This estimation was based solely on the
    observation of climatic conditions, neglecting the influence of irrigation quantities
    on plant growth and soil moisture dynamics. Conversely, the proposed irrigation
    system demonstrated its efficacy in area ‘A’ through the evaluation of climatic
    and soil variables. It effectively delivered a precise water supply while maintaining
    soil moisture levels near the optimal range for apple trees. By incorporating
    these variables, the proposed irrigation system proficiently optimized the water
    supply for apple trees, resulting in a notable water-saving of nearly 61 % (±2%)
    over a 10-day period. The farmer consciously decided to apply an average of 110
    mm of water, whereas the SPIS determined a more optimal irrigation amount of 51.6
    mm, equivalent to an approximate daily application rate of 5.16 mm/day. This demonstration
    underscores the system''s efficiency and significance in precise irrigation management,
    ensuring the health and optimal growth of plants. Similarly, the power consumption
    in area ‘B’ stands at approximately 620Wh. Nevertheless, by optimizing water usage
    levels using the proposed SPIS-based FL decision and impulse solenoids, a remarkable
    reduction of approximately 46 % in overall power consumption has been achieved.
    6. Conclusion In this paper, a feedback FL control and combined soil-weather approach
    were presented, to foster water conservation and better irrigation scheduling
    and management in the eastern agriculture fields of Morocco. The fuzzy controller,
    developed based on Mamdani fuzzification using trapezoidal and triangular membership
    functions, effectively determined the duration of irrigation for crops. This utilization
    of FL control played a crucial role in maintaining soil moisture levels above
    pre-defined thresholds, exhibiting slight oscillations to prevent excessive run-off,
    thus conserving water and energy resources. To facilitate real-time performance
    monitoring and the creation of a comprehensive database, LoRa protocol has been
    utilised to communicate with a developed IoT platform. This enabled data to be
    collected on key environmental and climatic variables, as well as precise information
    on irrigation duration and soil proprieties. Presently, this is significantly
    contributing to data analysis and enhancing system performance. Implementing the
    system is straightforward, and its economic viability. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: Due to the increasing world population, demand for food products have
    created the need to modernize and intensify agricultural operations through precision
    agriculture. The Internet of Things offers a wide variety of solutions for precision
    agriculture, but implementing it in the agriculture field imposes challenges to
    hardware and data communication in the network. Importantly, the sensor nodes
    have to be reliable for long periods with the limited available battery power.
    In this connection, the goal of this paper is to propose an efficient data collection
    algorithm which improves the network lifetime of the wireless sensor network (WSN),
    decreases the energy hole issue and reduces the data collection delay. In the
    proposed work, the rendezvous points (RPs) in the network are selected based on
    the energy level of the nodes, data packet density and the distance to the RPs.
    Then the mobile sink (MS) moves to the RPs in the shortest possible path to collect
    the data from the data-powered points. A hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm called
    WOAXGWO is proposed to find the shortest path for the MS. To assess the performance,
    the network's lifetime, energy consumption, and latency are considered. Simulation
    findings show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and are validated on
    a coconut farm to demonstrate its reliability.

    lifetimeAgriculture 1. Introduction According to the UN Food and Agricultural
    Organization, the world will need to produce 70% more food in 2050 due to the
    exponential growth of the population [1]. But the challenges such as shrinking
    agricultural lands, natural resource depletion, and declining agriculture workforce
    triggered the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) based solutions in farming.
    It helps farmer to ensure high crop yield, reduce operational costs, and to close
    the supply demand gap [2]. In addition, IoT leverages an important advantage of
    automating the irrigation system and monitoring the agriculture field conditions
    from anywhere in the world. Favorably, smart agriculture is under major focus
    and in R&D in recent years [3]. In farming, the IoT is deployed for irrigation
    management, disease and pest monitoring, soil and water quality monitoring, and
    intelligent greenhouses [4]. The IoT is defined as the system of inter-related
    computing devices which has the ability to transfer data across the network without
    any human interventions [1]. IoT integrates a bundle of technologies such as Wireless
    Sensor Networks (WSN), middleware systems, cloud computing and end-user applications.
    Implementation of IoT in any application involves four major components: IoT devices,
    communication technology, internet and data storage, processing and monitoring
    [5]. The IoT devices are battery operated embedded systems deployed in the farm
    to measure field data such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, soil moisture and
    soil nutrition. The measured data values are transmitted to the cloud/database
    server for data storage, data processing and to extract meaningful information.
    Using the derived information, the necessary actions are automated with the help
    of actuators. Real time monitoring systems are used to present the information
    to the farmers in their own understandable form. In this work, IoT is deployed
    to irrigate a coconut farm and the farm taken into consideration uses Tamil Nadu
    Agricultural University (TNAU) [6] prescribed main and sub channel drip irrigation
    model. The sensors monitor soil moisture, nutrition and weather data are deployed
    in the farm which are capable of communicating with each other through Zigbee
    [7]. The corresponding implementation of the IoT ecosystem at coconut farm is
    shown in Fig. 1. Though IoT yield number of benefits, there are numerous challenges
    in implementing it in the agriculture field, namely, poor internet connectivity,
    high hardware costs, high maintenance and lack of data security [8]. In particular,
    since the sensor nodes are mostly battery operated, the available energy in the
    nodes are limited [9]. The major energy consumer of a sensor node is radio module
    [10]. So during data transfer, improper routing and imbalance in workload will
    cause uneven energy consumption between the nodes creating energy hole issues.
    Consequently, it reduces the network lifetime and results in huge maintenance
    cost. Using mobile sink (MS) with an efficient data collection technique is one
    of the most effective approaches to mitigate the energy hole issues and minimize
    the data packet delay and packet loss [11], [12], [13]. Download : Download high-res

    Data collection using MS can be categorized into direct and rendezvous methods
    [14]. In direct method, the MS moves to each node and collects data from them
    individually. But with the large number of sensors deployed in the network, it
    induces high data collection delays [15], [16]. Rather, in a rendezvous based
    data collection method, the subset of sensors called rendezvous points (RPs) or
    collection points are selected and the other nodes send the data to the closest
    RP. Then, MS moves to each RP and collects data from them. So the rendezvous based
    method facilitates collecting the data well before the delay bound [17], [18].
    Moreover, improper or static RP rotation policy will cause huge workload on the
    RP nodes and again resulting in the energy hole issue [19]. In order to tackle
    this problem, dynamic RP selection policy [14] is employed where the energy and
    workload balance among the sensors can be achieved. The next challenge is planning
    the trajectory for efficient data collection from the RPs using the mobile sink,
    which is an NP-hard problem [20]. Trajectory planning can be either a learning-based
    or non-learning-based approaches. In this work, a non-learning based approach
    is employed in order to reduce the computational complexity. Finding the tour
    is essentially the well-known traveling salesman problem (TSP), where the goal
    is to find the shortest path to visit all the RPs. TSP can be solved using optimization
    techniques and, in the literature, algorithms such as the whale optimization algorithm
    (WOA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), ant colony optimization algorithms (ACO)
    [21], etc., have been used. Though these algorithms are effective in solving routing
    problems, they suffer from poor convergence and trapping of local optima. Among
    these algorithms, the performance of WOA has been proven better than the other
    algorithms. WOA works best, especially in the exploration phase, but it lacks
    performance in the exploitation phase [22], [23]. Hence, in this paper, a new
    hybrid meta heuristic algorithm called WOAXGWO is proposed to avoid premature
    convergence, improve WOA’s exploitation phase, and extend the network lifetime.

    a novel hybrid meta-heuristic optimization algorithm (WOAXGWO) is proposed to
    improve the performance of the WOAs exploitation phase and alleviate the premature
    convergence. The proposed data collection algorithm first finds the optimal set
    of RPs for each round based on the weight factor calculated using residual energy,
    the data packet density of the node, and the distance between the next nearest
    RPs. • Then the mobile sink determines the shortest route to visit all the RPs
    to reduce the data collection delay. The shortest tour path is determined by solving
    the TSP problem using the proposed WOAXGWO algorithm. • The results of the proposed
    WOAXGWO are compared against other state-of-the-arts such as WOA, GWO, IGWO, and
    WOAGWO. The simulation results for the proposed algorithm are presented. In addition,
    the proposed model is implemented in real time coconut farm to prove its reliability,
    and the corresponding results are shown. 2. Related work Generally, the network
    is divided into a number of grids where each grid has an RP node with a number
    of other sensor nodes. Many works in the literature employed dynamic RP selection
    policies, metaheuristic algorithms, etc. to choose the RPs in the network [14].
    Artificial fish swarm optimization algorithm, Global Levy Flight of Cuckoo Search,
    Particle Swarm Optimization, WOA are some of the optimization algorithms used
    to choose RPs in the network [24]. Residual energy, coverage contribution, data
    fusion degree, the hop distance, the number of packets transmitted and randomly
    generated values are the parameters majorly used in the selection process [17].
    And to forward data from the ordinary nodes to the RP, ring and tree topology
    is the most adopted techniques. In tree topology, the RP nodes act as the root
    nodes. The main disadvantage is that the network experiences under additional
    load during each round due to the tree construction phase. Also there are chances
    that the same nodes get elected as RPs in consecutive rounds. This would cause
    a huge data forwarding load and an energy imbalance among the nodes. Considering
    the movement cost of the MS, it must travel in the shortest possible path to reduce
    end-to-end data collection delay. For this purpose, a number of works in the literature
    employed TSP. TSP can be solved using optimization techniques [17] and the most
    recent interesting trend in optimization algorithms is hybrid metaheuristics [25].
    The major challenge in the development of any meta-heuristic algorithm is to find
    the balance between exploration and exploitation phase. Exploration phase is the
    process in which the optimization algorithm investigates the promising area of
    the search space while in the exploitation phase concerns to the local search
    capability in the design space found in exploration phase [26]. To enhance the
    performance of the metaheuristic algorithms, one algorithm is hybridized with
    another to extract the best performance [25]. Some of the hybrid algorithms proposed
    in the literature are; ant colony optimization algorithm with glow swarm optimization
    [21], dragon fly with firefly algorithms [27], etc. In [21], ant colony optimization
    algorithm is integrated with glow swarm optimization approach, to find the optimal
    cluster head. Distance, delay and energy is used as the parameters in the fitness
    function to select the cluster head. In [27], dragon fly and firefly algorithms
    are hybridized to find the RPs where the fitness function is designed based on
    energy, delay and distance. While, grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm is used
    to propose a distance based clustering algorithm in [28] to improve the performance
    of the WSN. Chauhan et al. [29] proposed firefly optimization algorithm based
    RP selection using the residual energy of the nodes, distance between nodes and
    node to sink. Boyineni et al. [17] proposed a modified ACO algorithm to find the
    RPs and the trajectory for mobile sink by considering residual energy and distance.
    But these works failed in considering path cost, network load balancing and data
    collection latency. One of the widely used latest optimization algorithm is WOA,
    in which the performance in finding the best solution (exploration phase) is good
    but it lacks refining the optimum solution (exploitation phase) [30]. In the literature,
    the simulated annealing algorithm is embedded in WOA algorithm [31] and GWO is
    hybridized with WOA (WOAGWO) [32] to enhance the exploitation phase of WOA. But
    the problem of imbalance between the exploration and exploitation phase still
    existed in both the works. An improved version of GWO (IGWO) is proposed in [33]
    to alleviate the imbalance, but it lacked the performance in the exploration phase.
    Hence, in this work, GWO is improved using dimension learning-based hunting (DLH)
    mechanism and is hybridized with WOA. The resultant algorithm is named as WOAXGWO
    and is used to solve the TSP problem in this work. 2.1. Grey wolf optimization
    GWO is based on the hunting behavior of grey wolves in which the search process
    is controlled by three best wolves , , and in each iteration, and leads wolves
    to the best position to find global solutions. Encircling the prey and hunting
    are the two main steps of wolf hunting. First, the wolves stop the movement of
    the prey by encircling them. The corresponding mathematical formulation is given
    by where . Here, is the current iteration, is the position of the prey, and coefficient
    vectors and are used to control the movement of the wolves near the prey. In the
    hunting process, the alpha wolf identifies the best solution and it updates its
    position if improved at each iteration. While beta and delta wolves identify the
    prey’s location. The following are the equations that are used to update the position
    of the wolves. But in contrast, GWO suffers from the imbalance between the exploration
    and exploitation phase, and stagnation in the local optima [33]. 3. System model
    In this paper, wireless homogeneous sensor nodes are considered and randomly deployed
    in a two dimensional space. These nodes are static in nature which are capable
    of communicating with each other. They are grouped together to form a network
    and the established network model can be described as a bidirectional weighted
    graph G(V,E,w) where is the set of all sensor nodes given by , is the set of all
    the edges in the network given by and is the weight of the edge. Here is a communication
    link established between the nodes and . and are given by where is the Euclidean
    distance between the sensor node and . The sensor nodes are homogeneous, and hence,
    the same initial energy ( ) is set to all the nodes. The location and energy information
    about sensor nodes with G(V,E,w) of the network is fed in MS. In order to collect
    the sensed data and to balance the energy and workload among the sensor nodes
    in the network, dynamic RP selection policy [17] is used. For each round, the
    number of RP nodes in the network are selected and given by and . Then, the possible
    paths to reach all the RPs are constructed, and the distance of the path is given
    by . The shortest path is chosen by the MS to collect data from the RPs where
    that minimizes the sum . Here, finding the shortest path by MS is similar to finding
    the shortest path by solving TSP. As TSP is an NP-hard problem solving it requires
    a better optimization algorithm and in this work new optimization algorithm WOAXGWO
    is proposed and used to solve TSP. So the main goals of this work are summarized
    as follows: (1) improve the network lifetime ( ) of the network by selecting optimal
    RPs dynamically (2) minimize the distance traveled by the MS to collect data from
    RPs and (3) consequently minimize the data delivery delay . This work considers
    that: (1) Wireless links are symmetric and bidirectional. (2) The sensor nodes
    can adjust their transmission power based on the distance between the nodes. (3)
    There are no isolated nodes in the network. (4) There are no obstacles between
    any pair of nodes. 3.1. Energy model The most common radio model [34] is considered
    in this work. Radio communication between the nodes are two types: (1) free-space
    model and (2) multi-path fading model. When the distance between the nodes is
    less than , the nodes can communicate in a single hop and is called as a free-space
    model. While if the distance between them is greater than , they communicate through
    multi hop and is called as a multi-path model. The energy consumption for transmitting
    an bit message over distance for free space and multi-path model is given by (1)
    and the energy consumption to receive this message is given by (2) where , , and
    . 4. Proposed model The proposed work has three subsections: (1) a procedure to
    select rendezvous points in the network, (2) a novel hybrid meta-heuristic optimization
    algorithm WOAXGWO to find the shortest path for the MS to reach all the RPs, and
    (3) a scheme to collect data. 4.1. Rendezvous points selection MS calculates the
    weight factor ( ) for all the sensor nodes and the nodes with heavier will be
    selected as RP. The weight of the node is calculated by multiplying the energy
    ratio with the number of packets that the node generated and the distance to the
    nearest RP. (3) where represents the probability of the node to be selected as
    RP, is the current round number, , is residual energy and is the initial energy
    of the node . is the number of data packets generated by in round and returns
    the distance between sensor and the closest RP. Here, returns the closest RP to
    the sensor and is given by (4) where is the set of RPs and . Initially and if
    there is no RP selected by the algorithm, then . The Eq. (3) ensures the following:
    1. The probability of the node getting selected as RP in round is high, are the
    ones with maximum residual energy, maximum number of data packets generated in
    the previous round. 2. The node which is farthest to the already selected RP has
    high value and hence it ensures that the RPs are spread evenly and hence, the
    number of nodes connected with each RPs is similar and the energy depletion among
    the nodes are balanced. 4.2. WOAXGWO for shortest path selection The performance
    of WOA in finding the best solution (exploration phase) is good, but it lacks
    refining the optimum solution (exploitation phase). So a hybrid WOA approach is
    proposed to improve the exploitation phase and to find the best route for MS to
    reach all RPs. The corresponding algorithm for selecting the best path using WOAXGWO
    is presented in Algorithm 1. The set of selected RPs in the network is fed as
    input to WOAXGWO. To find the tour path, a random RP is selected as a source node
    and from that the distance to other RPs (agents) are computed. Then, the population
    limit of the search agents that is the number of RPs ( ) is initialized. For each
    agent, the is assigned as fitness function ( ). The agent with best score is considered
    as . To start the hunt, the algorithm locates the prey (the next best RP) using
    (5) Download : Download high-res image (622KB) Download : Download full-size image
    where is the position vector ( ) and is the best position of the whale ( ) i.e.
    the best next RP found by the algorithm so far. Initially, the best position is
    chosen randomly. The coefficient vectors and are calculated by , where is a random
    vector in the interval of , is decreased from 2 to 0 to achieve shrinking encircling
    mechanism based on . Here, is the current iteration and represents the allowed
    number of maximum iterations. By adjusting the vectors and , the whale can locate
    itself near the prey. Next, the algorithm generates a random value in the range
    between 0 and 1. Based on the values of and , the algorithm chooses its action
    between (a) positioning the whale in the found best position, (b) exploration
    and (c) exploitation phase. If the value of is less than 0.5 and if then the whale
    is positioned at the best position found so far based on Eq. (5) (refer to line
    9 in Algorithm 1). The exploration phase is initiated if and . In this phase,
    to move the whale far away from the current position, the value of is chosen either
    greater than 1 or less than −1. Hence, the position of the search agents is updated
    using the below given equation (6) where is randomly chosen position of the whale.
    Exploration phase is shown in Algorithm 1 between the lines 12 and 15. If the
    value of is greater than 0.5, then the exploitation phase is initiated. In Algorithm
    1, lines 16 to 24 explain the exploitation phase. Here, the current position of
    the search agent is updated by GWO based approach. The first three best search
    agents from the population are considered as , , and . Then, the prey encircling
    is determined by considering the position of , , and from the equations below;
    (7) (8) here is the iteration number. The first candidate for the new position
    of search agent named as which is calculated by the following equation (9) When
    the new position of the search agent is generated only with the help of three
    best search agents, it causes the search agents to get trapped in local optima
    and slower convergence rate. So dimension learning-based hunting (DLH) mechanism
    [33] is adapted. The position of the search agent at the th iteration is given
    by where is the dimension number of the problem. In DLH mechanism, search agents
    individual hunting is considered and is learned by its neighbors. So, the neighbors
    of are constructed and is given by (10) where is the distance between the position
    vector and at iteration and the radius is given by (11) After constructing , multi-neighbor
    learning is performed where each dimension of the search agent new position is
    calculated by the th dimension of the neighbor chosen from and the random search
    agent from the population. (12) where is th dimension of . The last phase of WOAXGWO
    is selection and updating phase. In this phase, the fitness value of and is compared
    and the best candidate is selected from them. (13) is selected as next best RP.
    The process is repeated until all the nodes are traversed and the best path is
    found. 4.3. Data collection scheme 1. TDMA schedule is assigned for the communication
    between RP and the ordinary nodes to avoid packet congestion and packet losses.
    In the assigned time schedule, ordinary nodes transmit the sensed data to the
    RP and only the nodes which transmit the data will be active. In order to save
    the energy, all other nodes will turn-off their radio. 2. After collecting the
    data from the ordinary nodes, RP aggregates the data to avoid redundancy and fair
    utilization of bandwidth. 3. MS travels to all the RPs in the path selected using
    WOAXGWO. Once the MS reaches an RP, it transmits a Ready-to-Receive beacon to
    the RP. RP acknowledges back by sending the aggregated data to the MS. 4. After
    receiving the data from an RP, MS moves to the next RP. The data collection algorithm
    is provided below as Algorithm 2. Download : Download high-res image (402KB) Download

    Analysis of exploitation capability The functions f1–f7 have only one global optimum,
    and hence they are called as unimodal functions. These functions can be used to
    evaluate the exploitation capability of the proposed meta-heuristic algorithm.
    It can be noted from the Table 2 that the proposed WOAXGWO algorithm is capable
    of providing competitive test results on unimodal functions. In particular, WOAXGWO
    outperforms other meta-heuristic algorithms in F1, F2 and F5. This is due the
    adaptation of DLH search strategy with the integrated mechanism of GWO in WOA.

    f8–f23 are multimodal and fixed-dimension multimodal functions which allow to
    evaluate exploration capabilities of meta-heuristic algorithms since they have
    many local optima. The corresponding evaluation results are presented in Table
    3 and is evident that WOAXGWO is very competitive in exploration as well. Thus
    proving that the performance of the WOA is improved in both exploration and exploitation
    phase. 6. Numerical simulation 6.1. Evaluation of the proposed algorithm To evaluate
    the performance of the proposed work, MATLAB simulator is used to develop the
    simulation environment. The nodes are deployed randomly in 100 × 100 simulation
    area and are varied between 50 and 200. The proposed work is compared against
    EAPC [37], MSECA [29] and DDCF [14] because these works have similar objectives
    as that of the proposed work. The sensors are homogeneous in nature and it is
    assumed that, initially all the sensor nodes are fully charged with 0.5 J of energy.
    The speed of the mobile sink is set to 1 m/s, the data transmission rate is 20
    kbps and it is assumed that there are no obstacles in the MS path. All the other
    parameters and their values are presented in Table 4. Networks energy decreases
    when the data transmission begins. Fig. 2(a) shows the comparison of average energy
    consumption of the network in a round and Fig. 2(b) depicts the comparison of
    average energy consumption of a node in a round. The proposed work yields best
    performance as it consumes very minimal energy than other three existing works
    (EAPC, MSECA and DDCF). Also, it is noticeable from Fig. 2(a) that, the energy
    consumption of the network increases with the increase in the number of nodes.
    In the proposed work, the average network energy consumption is minimized as the
    RP nodes are spread evenly across the network. This ensures that the distance
    between any node and its RP is less and hence reducing the energy consumption
    for data communication. In addition, a considerable amount of energy can be saved
    through data aggregation before forwarding the data in the network. Also, the
    average energy consumption of a node per round (Fig. 2(b)) is reduced because
    all the complex computations such as RP selection and the routing algorithms are
    performed by the MS. These computed routing information from the MS are forwarded
    to the source nodes through RPs. Hence, the computation load and energy drain
    of the nodes have reduced drastically. Table 4. Simulation parameters. Parameter
    Value Area 100 m × 100 m Number of sensor nodes 50–200 Node deployment Random

    512 bytes Size of control packet 25 bytes In order to increase the number of rounds,
    it is important to observe the behavior of residual energy. As shown in Fig. 3(a)
    the proposed algorithm performs better when compared to other algorithms as it
    covers a number of rounds. The energy spent by the node is less in each round
    due to the proposed energy efficient data collection scheme. Fig. 3(b) compares
    the performance of the algorithms in terms of network lifetime. In this work,
    the network lifetime is measured by calculating the time span between the network’s
    operation initiation and the time at which the first node ran out of its energy.
    Through the proposed work, only the nodes with higher residual energy and the
    nodes that generate a large number of data packets in the network can become RP.
    This reduce the chances of early node dead and eventually increases the network
    lifetime. Download : Download high-res image (442KB) Download : Download full-size

    lifetime analysis. Furthermore, Fig. 4(a) depicts the number of alive nodes after
    each round of execution. To compute this, the network size is set to 200 nodes.
    As the network starts data transmission, the energy of the node decreases and
    eventually drains all its energy. The improvement in the number of alive nodes
    is observed with the proposed algorithm, and it is due to the and other factors
    considered in the fitness function for the RP selection. Likewise Fig. 4(b), compares
    the analysis of dead nodes in the network. In Fig. 5(a), the performance of the
    algorithms in terms of worst case end to end data delivery delay is analyzed by
    varying the network size. Delay is minimal with the proposed data collection algorithm
    because the tour cost for the MS is minimized with the help of the proposed hybrid
    WOAXGWO algorithm. With the adopted DLH mechanism, WOAXGWO avoids ending up in
    local optima and premature convergence and obtains the optimum result quicker.
    Also, the proposed work, ensures that the RPs are evenly spread in the network
    to avoid data hotspot issues which eventually reduces packet loss and packet re-transmission.
    In addition to that, TDMA scheduling is incorporated to reduce the delay due to
    data collision. Download : Download high-res image (414KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Comparison of network performance metrics. 6.2. Real time
    implementation of proposed method The proposed work is tested in the laboratory
    setup with 10 XBee based sensor nodes and a mobile sink in an area of 20 ft ×
    20 ft room without any obstacles. The mobile sink is designed using raspberry
    pi, and the sensor node is designed using Arduino UNO with XBee modules for communication.
    All the 10 sensor nodes are powered using 12 V battery and among them three nodes
    are considered as rendezvous points. Each sensor node is equipped with soil moisture
    sensors. So, now all the nodes have same initial energy, sensing and computational
    capability, hence making the network homogeneous in nature. In this work, for
    computational simplicity, homogeneous network is considered. But, in actual scenario,
    different sensors must be used to measure different aspects of the environment
    (heterogeneous network). The real time parameters and components used are listed
    in Table 5. The communication is initiated, and the drop in voltage is observed
    as average voltage drop directly implies the average energy consumed. The desirable
    working voltage for Arduino is between 12 V and 5 V and if the voltage of the
    node drops below 5 V, the node is considered as dead in this experiment. The proposed
    work is compared against ESDCS [38]. After every 20 min, the RP rotation is performed
    based on the proposed RP selection strategy. Also, the battery voltage for all
    the nodes are observed every 20 min and the average voltage against time are plotted
    and presented as graph in Fig. 5(b). The first node dead for ESDCS is noted in
    100th min and for the proposed work in the 120th min. Through this observation,
    the proposed RP selection strategy with the considered parameters proves to be
    more reliable and the workload of the nodes is evenly balanced than ESDCS. In
    order to measure the average packet delay, the packet is time stamped at the node
    during the packet construction. The packet is transmitted to the sink where the
    system time is noted and the difference in time is logged at the sink which is
    measured as delay. The average delay measured through the proposed work is 10
    s while with ESDCS, it is 12 s. The observed delay is minimal with the proposed
    work and is due to the proposed shortest path selection algorithm using WOAXGWO.

    considered as a control group. All the 20 trees are about 50–60 years old, tall
    variety and planted in sandy soil where the soil moisture mostly differs between
    7–9. Drip irrigation is used for irrigating the farm. Though the crop yield depends
    on various factors like nutrition and fertilizer application, here in this work
    to evaluate the reliability of the proposed work, only the quantity of water used
    for irrigation and the yield obtained is considered while treating the crop with
    same nutrition supply. Three sensors are deployed (one for each drip sub-line)
    with an MS and tested the proposed work during the months between June 2020–May

    scarcity condition, the required quantity of water per tree according to Tamil
    Nadu agriculture university expert system for coconut [6] is 30 L per day for
    the months of June, July, October, November and December while 35 L per day for
    the months of January, August and September and 45 L for the months of February
    to May [6]. An actuator with flow control and solenoid valve is deployed to measure,
    manage and control the irrigation. In this work, round-robin irrigation policy
    is adopted and the trees are irrigated once in four days. To say, in the month
    of December, a tree is irrigated with 120 L of water once in four days and hence
    the equation falls to 30 L/day. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    Soil moisture sensors are deployed for three trees as shown in Fig. 6(a) to know
    if the moisture of the soil falls below the threshold value. The corresponding
    circuit diagrams are shown in Fig. 6, Fig. 6. As these sensor nodes are static
    in nature, their GPS location information are pre-fed them to save energy. Fig.
    7(a) depicts the amount of water to be irrigated prescribed by the TNAU expert
    system with the average amount of water used for irrigation per tree per day by
    both the proposed work and drip irrigation models. Fig. 7(a) shows that the water
    irrigated through the proposed work follows the prescribed pattern and varies
    its water usage according to the month of irrigation. But with the manual drip
    irrigation model, the amount of water used is usually higher than the prescribed
    amount as the farmer irrigates with the available power supply rather measuring
    the amount of water used. Generally, the crop is harvested once in 45 days. So
    in the period of evaluation, the crop is harvested seven times and the corresponding
    yield is presented in Fig. 7(b). In Table 6, the yield achieved through the proposed
    method for the corresponding harvested period is given. Here, the yield is measured
    by calculating the total number of crops cultivated per tree and the total weight
    of the coconut crop in kilograms for all the 10 trees obtained through the proposed
    work is presented. From Fig. 7(b), the proposed model yield is significantly improved
    when compared to the drip irrigation method. The result in Fig. 7(a) also shows
    that the amount of water used for irrigation is less with the proposed work than
    with the manual model. Thus, the proposed method achieves better yield with less
    water consumption for irrigation in relation to the ability to achieve reliability.

    7. Conclusion In this paper, the energy efficient data collection scheme using
    mobile sink is presented to reduce the energy hole problem. The proposed work
    selects the rendezvous points based on residual energy, packet density of the
    nodes and distance to the existing RP such that it reduces the energy consumption
    of the sensor nodes. A hybrid meta-heuristic WOAXGWO algorithm is proposed using
    which MS solves the TSP problem to visit all the RPs for data collection. The
    results obtained through computer simulations show that, the proposed work consumes
    about 17% less energy than DDCF and also outperforms MSECA and EAPC algorithms
    in terms of network lifetime and delay. The proposed model is also tested in irrigating
    the real-time coconut farm, and the results prove that it produces a similar yield
    to that of traditional drip irrigation practices. This work is limited to small-scale
    WSNs and it is not validated for large-scale networks, communication characteristics
    in logistic supply chain management systems, and multiple mobile sinks. In future
    work, machine learning algorithms will be implemented to optimize the water and
    fertilizer usage and the sensors will be equipped with energy harvesters to prolong
    the network lifetime. CRediT authorship contribution statement Vishnuvarthan Rajagopal:

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Belagavi, India SECTION I. Introduction Contemporary
    farming practices exhibit increased efficiency in agricultural development compared
    to earlier periods. The early indications of significant transformations in daily
    life and agricultural supply chains are becoming evident, particularly in the
    networks for food, fiber, and bio-energy distribution. This article delves into
    the current state of industrial agriculture, drawing insights from patterns at
    the farm level, production techniques, and agri-food supply within the industrialized
    context. To realize Agriculture 4.0, we explore the integration of artificial
    intelligence, big data, and blockchain. Our proposed approach facilitates the
    continuous monitoring and management of agricultural operations via remote observation,
    underpinned by IoT, AI, and related technologies. The article hones in on key
    research challenges and applications of these emerging technologies in the agriculture
    sector, aimed at introducing novel research opportunities to industry professionals.
    Anticipating the development of foundational IoT and technological tools for agricultural
    production, we envision a future characterized by interconnected, dependable,
    and productive agriculture [1]. Traditionally, predicting crop yields was a task
    undertaken by farmers who relied on their personal experience and knowledge of
    the specific field and crop cultivation and disease identification [17], [18].
    Nevertheless, the challenge of accurately forecasting agricultural crop prices
    persists, necessitating a more data-driven approach. This challenge can be effectively
    addressed through the utilization of statistical data analysis, pattern tracking,
    visualization techniques, and other data mining methods facilitated by computer
    applications. This study presents a comprehensive model for forecasting crop prices
    by leveraging the past decade''s worth of data on agricultural field crop prices
    and incorporating detailed weather information, including rainfall data. The objective
    of this research paper is to develop a robust framework for predicting future
    crop prices that takes into account various interdependent factors. By harnessing
    a decade''s worth of historical data on agricultural field crop prices and coupling
    it with pertinent weather data, a structured approach to classifying crop prices
    emerges. In summary, this research endeavor aims to provide an innovative solution
    to the complex challenge of forecasting crop prices. Through a meticulous analysis
    of historical agricultural field crop prices and the incorporation of relevant
    weather data, this model endeavors to empower farmers with valuable insights into
    future crop pricing trends [2]. Fig. 1 Rapid growth of agriculture. Show All Agriculture
    involves the application of modern data analysis techniques to enhance decision-making
    and crop management practices. This approach leverages various advanced technologies,
    including automated steering systems, Geomapping, remote sensing, satellite positioning
    systems, and variable rate technology. The overarching goal of precision agriculture
    is to incorporate automation into the agricultural domain. However, it remains
    crucial for farmers to acquaint themselves with these technological advancements.
    Overcoming these obstacles can lead to streamlined agricultural processes and
    improved outcomes. The rapid advancement of computational methods has opened doors
    to the integration of data mining principles in agriculture. This research paper
    seeks to shed light on both the merits and demerits of precision agriculture,
    thereby offering insights to guide its effective implementation. By addressing
    the challenges and benefits, this study aims to facilitate the progress of agricultural
    practices in the right direction [3]. Agriculture''s significance as a crucial
    foundation in China is unwavering, and the constant progress in science and technology
    has consistently been accessible to all. Enhancing the scientific precision and
    convenience of farming for a broader community through intelligent technology,
    while concurrently tackling challenges and predicaments in agricultural practices,
    remains an enduring concern deserving thoughtful consideration and practical action.
    This study''s objective is to establish an innovative paradigm within the agricultural
    landscape. By harnessing the structural framework of this emerging agricultural
    knowledge base, the aim is to establish a standardized and systematic repository
    of knowledge. This encompassing repository includes an extraction corpus for agricultural
    planting data, intended to be a vital resource during data mining and model creation.
    The ultimate aspiration is to offer an effective and specialized solution in the
    form of an extensive big data corpus for crop planting. This resource is poised
    to serve as a proficient catalyst for applications involving agricultural knowledge
    graphs [4]. In agricultural fields, predominantly situated in desert areas, face
    significant climatic impacts on both crops and workers. These expansive fields
    often lie far from residential zones, posing challenges for effective monitoring
    and management. To address these issues, this study introduces an innovative smart
    irrigation system employing Zigbee technology for wireless monitoring and control.
    The system takes into account crucial parameters such as temperature, humidity,
    moisture, and gas concentration. Real-time assessment of farm conditions occurs,
    prompting automated adjustments to irrigation and cooling systems. The acquired
    data is communicated wirelessly to farmers. A unique aspect of this research involves
    modeling the system as an Agent-based framework, portraying the dynamic state
    of the agricultural field. Practical implementation and testing took place on
    a small-scale farm, effectively tracking farm status, depicting system behavior,
    and promptly responding to abnormal data. Notably, the results indicate that the
    system''s implementation enhances crop quality, leading to increased production
    levels [5]. Fig. 2 presents the existing agricultural technologies and the models.
    Fig. 2 Agricultural technologies and models. Show All The Indian agricultural
    sector has symbolized rural development movements such as the green, yellow, white,
    and blue revolutions. Serving as the driving force of the economy, a significant
    portion of the population is directly or indirectly engaged in farming. The overarching
    objective is to enhance both crop quality and quantity while optimizing labor
    input. The emergence of smart farming and the integration of the Internet of Things
    into agriculture are propelling a potential Third Green Revolution. Given the
    current circumstances, the adoption of smart agriculture has become an imperative.
    This research was conducted in the delta districts of Tamil Nadu, aiming to assess
    farmers'' characteristics and their knowledge regarding the adoption of smart
    agricultural practices. Furthermore, the study delved into identifying the significant
    challenges that farmers encounter when adopting smart agricultural techniques.
    Ultimately, the insights from this study can serve as valuable guidance for policymakers
    in comprehending farmers'' perceptions toward embracing smart agriculture. Enhancing
    the well-being of farmers not only benefits them individually but also contributes
    to the overall growth of the country [6]. SECTION II. Related Work With the continuous
    advancement of the Internet of Things, the realm of smart agriculture is undergoing
    a rapid evolution. Leveraging IoT-based solutions presents farmers with the opportunity
    to augment profits and decrease manual labor demands on their agricultural fields.
    Intelligent agricultural systems harness efficient, cost-effective sensors strategically
    positioned around crops and within fields, gathering real-time data on crop status
    and environmental factors. This data serves dual purposes: immediate decision-making
    and long-term planning for improved outcomes. However, there exist hurdles such
    as communication delays, bandwidth usage, sporadic internet connectivity in rural
    locales, and cost implications that warrant attention. This article delves into
    our ongoing endeavors concerning a three-tier smart agriculture system founded
    on LoRa technology: (i) Sensing, (ii) Fog, and (iii) Cloud layers. Our primary
    focus lies in harnessing LoRa''s characteristics of low-power consumption and
    extended range to convert traditional rural Indian farmlands into hubs of intelligent
    agriculture. This initiative holds the potential to revolutionize agriculture
    in rural settings, aligning with the broader global trend driven smart agriculture
    while being tailored to address the specific challenges faced by Indian farmers.
    [7]. This study takes a focused approach towards leveraging technology to forecast
    fertilizer requirements, thereby amplifying crop yields and financial gains. The
    task of fertilizer prediction, a cornerstone of agriculture, involves the intricate
    determination of the most suitable type and optimal amount of fertilizers for
    specific crops. Despite its pivotal role, this task presents formidable challenges,
    directly impacting both crop yields and the overarching goal of environmental
    sustainability. To transcend these challenges, the research harnesses the Random
    Forest machine learning technique, selected for its demonstrated superiority in
    accuracy when compared to methods like linear regression and K-Nearest Neighbours.
    By assimilating historical conditions and insights from farmers through Kaggle
    datasets, this study establishes a predictive framework capable of suggesting
    appropriate fertilizers based on a comprehensive analysis of environmental, soil,
    and plant-related factors. As a result, the research contributes significantly
    to the realm of fertilization strategy forecasting, tailored to the unique conditions
    encompassing each agricultural scenario. In the larger context, this undertaking
    exemplifies the marriage of traditional agricultural wisdom with cutting-edge
    technology, promising a future where precision agriculture thrives and yields
    are maximized in harmony with ecological sustainability [8]. This research delves
    into the realm of smart agriculture powered by Internet of Things technologies,
    which have significantly transformed conventional farming methods. The infusion
    of sensors and devices into the agricultural landscape has generated copious amounts
    of data, driving the need for effective data management and transfer due to challenges
    in data volume and storage. The study''s primary objective is to examine and contrast
    diverse data reduction methods aimed at optimizing IoT data transmission within
    smart agriculture. The evaluation of these techniques employs a specialized real-time
    dataset tailored for smart agricultural systems, encompassing five key features:
    ambient air temperature, ambient air moisture, soil temperature, soil moisture,
    and soil pH. The assessment of the techniques is based on three core metrics:
    information loss, computational cost, and energy consumption, while factoring
    in the size of each transmitted sample. The implementation of the three data reduction
    methods is realized using the Python programming language. The findings emphasize
    the existence of a delicate balance between information loss, computational expenditure,
    and energy usage, warranting meticulous consideration when selecting an appropriate
    data reduction technique for IoT nodes in the context of smart agriculture applications.
    This analysis furnishes valuable insights for informed decision-making that effectively
    balances these factors, duly accounting for distinct application prerequisites
    and constraints [9]. Precision agriculture deploys sensors to monitor vital environmental
    factors like temperature, humidity, and water levels. Despite infrequent update
    needs for these attributes, sensors continuously transmit data, causing significant
    redundancy. This inefficiency wastes network resources and unnecessary energy.
    To tackle this, the LEACH routing protocol is introduced as a self-regulating,
    energy-efficient solution. Optimizing data aggregation, it aims to improve network
    efficiency and energy conservation. LEACH organizes sensor nodes into clusters
    with designated cluster heads that collect and summarize data before transmitting
    it to a central base station. This approach drastically reduces redundant data
    transmission, aided by the dynamic selection of cluster heads, which balances
    energy distribution among nodes. Traditional data aggregation methods directly
    transmit raw data to a central base station, causing redundancy and energy drain.
    In contrast, LEACH''s emphasis on aggregating data at its source mitigates network
    congestion and wasteful energy use. The study evaluates LEACH''s effectiveness
    against conventional data aggregation through energy efficiency, network durability,
    and data accuracy metrics. Simulations and empirical analysis provide insights
    into the protocol''s benefits and limitations across diverse scenarios. Overall,
    the LEACH protocol offers a promising solution to the challenge of redundant data
    transmission, contributing to energy-efficient precision agriculture [10]. In
    the contemporary era, the proliferation of IoT devices and emerging technologies
    has led to an exponential surge in data creation. Novel strategies are emerging
    to effectively manage such extensive data volumes. Leveraging this data to make
    informed decisions in agriculture, in tandem with the integration of smart agricultural
    techniques, holds the potential to revolutionize traditional farming practices.
    The efficacy of smart agriculture hinges on the seamless synchronization of diverse
    devices, where pivotal tasks include data retrieval, storage, and analysis. Traditional
    approaches, however, grapple with challenges such as data security, privacy concerns,
    real-time decision-making, and the handling of semi-structured and unstructured
    data when confronted with substantial data generation. In the realm of smart agriculture,
    Probabilistic Data Structures have emerged as a potent and efficient solution
    for managing data and facilitating real-time responses. This study is dedicated
    to thoroughly analyzing the implementation of PDS applications within the domain
    of smart agriculture. Delving into the foundations, challenges, unexplored research
    avenues, and potential trajectories of smart agriculture, this paper aims to comprehensively
    elucidate the role of PDS. It caters to readers and researchers eager to broaden
    their understanding of this domain and seeks to identify uncharted research opportunities
    within this evolving field [11], [12]. With the global population on the rise,
    the demand for increased crop production is becoming more pressing. Despite current
    efforts where farmers cater to global food requirements, challenges like dwindling
    horticultural space, resource depletion, and a growing population underscore the
    necessity to enhance agricultural yields. This has sparked the emergence of smart
    farming, a term encompassing a range of innovations by startups, technology pioneers,
    and governments aimed at bolstering overall crop output. SF involves integrating
    data, communication technologies, hardware, and sensors into agricultural systems
    to yield more insightful information. Detecting plant diseases efficiently using
    advanced algorithms becomes a crucial task in this context. The research paper
    addresses three key dimensions: firstly, an effective approach for disease detection
    and cavity area identification through the Image Segmentation Algorithm; secondly,
    the application of diverse data analysis methods tailored for improved crop management,
    including the use of an optical transducer for detecting Nitrogen, Phosphorous,
    and Potash levels in soil, as well as soil moisture content assessment through
    sensors; and thirdly, the utilization of machine learning algorithms to predict
    fertilizer quantities based on soil sample features, thereby aiding farmers in
    accurate amount estimation [13], [19], [20]. Drones, also recognized as unmanned
    aerial vehicles , have predominantly been linked with military and industrial
    functions. Nevertheless, recent strides in sensor and information technology have
    broadened their applications, encompassing sectors like agriculture. With the
    world''s population set to reach 9 billion by 2055, addressing the surge in agricultural
    demand is imperative. While agriculture holds immense promise, it grapples with
    multifaceted challenges—labor scarcity, erratic weather, inadequate fertilization,
    and health risks from chemicals and pests. Leveraging advanced technologies, particularly
    drones, holds the potential to tackle these hurdles. Drones play pivotal roles
    in irrigation, crop supervision, soil analysis, field evaluation, and pest management.
    Their evolution incorporates open-source solutions, advanced sensors, extended
    flight durations, and versatility in tasks spanning crime prevention to disaster
    monitoring. This research seeks to underscore the pivotal role of drones in agriculture
    and assess the finest drones available for crop and field monitoring. The objective
    is to elevate crop quality, forestall field deterioration, and foster sustainable
    agricultural practices. [14] New Agricultural Financial Entities encounter obstacles
    in their advancement due to financial constraints stemming from information disparities
    among financiers, limited collateral choices, and internal limitations. To mitigate
    these challenges, a pioneering strategy is put forth in this study. It harnesses
    the tamper-resistant and decentralized attributes of Blockchain technology in
    combination with the robust capabilities of Big Data for data mining, analysis,
    and processing. This inventive framework seeks to institute a reliable mechanism
    aimed at effectively tackling the financial barriers. By leveraging Blockchain''s
    transparency and data integrity, and utilizing Big Data''s analytical power, this
    approach intends to foster a secure and credible environment for financing transactions.
    The proposed solution addresses the lack of information symmetry by ensuring transparency
    and immutability of financial records through Blockchain. This empowers financiers
    alike with accurate and accessible information, reducing risks and enhancing trust.
    Furthermore, the integration of Big Data technology enhances risk assessment,
    enabling more informed lending decisions while expanding collateral options through
    comprehensive data analysis. Through this novel framework, can potentially access
    the funding they require, overcoming their financial impediments. By establishing
    a secure and efficient financing ecosystem, this approach aims to not only boost
    the progress contribute to the broader growth of the agricultural sector. As a
    result, this study''s innovative fusion of Blockchain and Big Data technologies
    presents a promising avenue for transforming the landscape of agricultural finance
    [15], [16]. SECTION III. Research Gap A significant challenge in the field of
    agriculture is the lack of integration and interconnectedness among various domains
    within the sector. This lack of synergy between different aspects of agriculture
    poses several drawbacks and limitations. Additionally, the slow adoption of advanced
    algorithms and combinational methods further compounds these challenges. Figure
    3 presents however, the isolation of these domains can lead to fragmented information
    and siloed decision-making. Farmers and stakeholders may lack a comprehensive
    view of their operations, making it difficult to optimize resource allocation
    and respond effectively to changing conditions. Without effective integration
    of agricultural domains, potential synergies between different aspects of farming
    remain untapped. For instance, if weather forecasts could be combined with soil
    data and crop growth patterns, farmers could make more informed decisions on irrigation
    and planting schedules. The absence of such interconnectedness hampers the ability
    to leverage valuable insights and seize opportunities for improved efficiency
    and productivity. Fig. 3. Interconnection of domains and revealing significance.
    Show All The lack of integrated data and algorithms contributes to inefficient
    resource management. For instance, fertilizers and pesticides might be applied
    uniformly across a field, regardless of variations in soil conditions or pest
    prevalence. This leads to unnecessary expenses, environmental impact, and reduced
    profitability. Sustainable agriculture requires careful consideration of environmental
    factors, resource use, and economic viability. Integrating algorithms and combinational
    methods could help identify optimal approaches for minimizing environmental impact
    while maintaining profitability. The absence of such integration could hinder
    the adoption of sustainable practices. Addressing these drawbacks necessitates
    a concerted effort to bridge the gaps between different agricultural domains and
    to accelerate the adoption of advanced algorithms and methods. Collaboration among
    researchers, technologists, policymakers, and farmers is essential to develop
    holistic solutions that optimize agricultural operations and contribute to a more
    resilient and sustainable future. SECTION IV. Proposed system Table 1 presents
    the gradations of disputes by incorporating Edge Computing into the IOT framework
    for climate determination in agriculture, we can leverage its advantages of real-time
    analysis, reduced data transmission, immediate responses, enhanced data privacy,
    scalability, and efficient handling of data volume. This innovative approach empowers
    farmers with actionable insights, enabling them to make informed decisions promptly
    and effectively manage climate conditions for optimal agricultural outcomes. Edge
    Computing is a paradigm that involves processing data closer to the data source,
    at the ''edge'' of the network, rather than sending all data to a centralized
    cloud server for analysis. In the context of agriculture and climate determination,
    this means that IOT devices equipped with sensors can process and analyse data
    locally, on-site, without the need to transmit all data to a distant cloud server.
    This reduces latency and enables faster decision-making. Table 2 presents the
    summary of various techniques especially Big Data analytics empowers stakeholders
    to make data-driven decisions by providing actionable insights based on comprehensive
    analyses. This can result in more informed market strategies and risk management.
    Probabilistic Data Structures might not offer the same level of data-driven decision
    support due to their limitations in handling complex, multidimensional data. In
    conclusion, while Probabilistic Data Structures have their place in specific data
    manipulation tasks, the intricate and multifaceted nature of Global Trade and
    Market Dynamics in agriculture benefits significantly from the capabilities of
    Big Data analytics. With its ability to handle comprehensive datasets, identify
    patterns, provide real-time insights, scale to accommodate growth, offer contextual
    understanding, and drive data-driven decisions, Big Data analytics stands as the
    preferred choice for efficiently determining global trade and market dynamics
    in agriculture. TABLE I. Comparison of several methods As compared with time taken

    CONCLUSION & FUTURE SCOPE In conclusion IoT-driven smart agriculture is revolutionizing
    the farming landscape, bolstering productivity and minimizing labor through the
    power of data-driven solutions. The seamless integration of real-time data capture
    and strategic sensor deployment empowers agile decision-making and strategic long-range
    planning. However, it''s important to confront hurdles like communication bottlenecks,
    financial implications, and connectivity challenges head-on. The convergence of
    machine learning with agriculture, as evidenced by techniques such as Random Forest,
    holds the potential to revolutionize crop yields through precise fertilizer predictions.
    This is particularly pivotal in meeting the global demand for sustenance. The
    strategic adoption of LoRa technology within the realm of intelligent agriculture
    opens doors to innovative breakthroughs, especially within rural Indian settings,
    presenting transformative solutions to age-old agricultural obstacles. Drones
    stand as indispensable tools, playing a pivotal role in overseeing crops, alleviating
    labor scarcities, and mitigating pest-related concerns. By incorporating Probabilistic
    Data Structures, the management of the copious data generated by IoT devices in
    agriculture gains efficiency and effectiveness. Moreover, the fusion of Blockchain
    and Big Data technologies has the capacity to overhaul agricultural financing,
    instilling transparency and fostering exponential growth. This amalgamation of
    technological prowess and agricultural acumen propels efficiency, sustainability,
    and advancement within the realm of farming, ushering in an era of unprecedented
    progress implementing the real time. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics

    Each day, the agriculture sector in India loses ground on both sides, which reduces
    the ecosystem’s potential for production. To resuscitate agriculture and return

    IEEE Conference Location: Coimbatore, India SECTION I. Introduction India is mostly
    an agricultural country. Farmers currently manually irrigate the area at regular
    intervals. There is a danger that the crop will get dry because of increased water
    usage or longer travel times for the water to its destination. In many agricultural
    fields, real-time temperature and humidity monitoring is vital. However, the outdated
    wired detecting control approach is rigid, which has various application restrictions.
    This initiative automates irrigation, which is a critical solution to this issue.
    A microcontroller is used to accomplish this, and it uses input to regulate the
    moisture and temperature sensors. This is accomplished by building an automated
    plant watering system using moisture sensors. The primary goals are to eliminate
    continual monitoring and to simplify supervision. With the aid of our system,
    we can implement smart agriculture. The IoT-based agricultural monitoring is part
    of this system. The IOT is revolutionizing the agriculture sector and overcoming
    the significant difficulties and barriers that farmers now confront. If the soil’s
    moisture content is low, then the relay unit connected to the motor switch needs
    to be regularly checked. The soil moisture sensor is used to assess whether the
    soil is wet or dry. It will activate the motor when the soil is dry and deactivate
    it when the soil is wet. SECTION II. Literature Review G. Santhakumar et al. [1]
    proposed a devastating storm that is not a pleasant source of water is what business
    industry in our nation depends on. The water structure is therefore employed in
    the world of commerce. Bush receives aquatic irrigation in an irrigation arrangement
    based on world kind. Plants’ leaf soundness and moisture are both managed during
    this stage The main objective of this work is to construct a pointed remote device
    affiliation (WSN) for a farming environment. In this project, there are two zones:
    the transmitter and the beneficiary space, which houses customers’ laptops. To
    determine how much sponginess is present in the soil, soil moisture monitoring
    equipment is employed. The microcontroller receives data from the moist sensing
    element so that the camera can interpret and monitor the leaf conditions. Within
    the range of 0-5V, sensing element yield is crucial in nature. A microcontroller
    converts unambiguous data to automatic information. The aquatic stream in an extremely
    tank starts to stream in an extremely line by turning on the engine precisely
    when the moisture content is dry. Once the moisture content reaches its maximum,
    the motor must be turned off before the aquatic stream can stop flowing in a straight
    line. Et-Taibi Bouali et al. [2] proposed the ecology is harmed by the unchecked
    control and extensive use of fossil fuels for irrigation water table pumps. In
    this article, they outline a comprehensive SA solution that makes use of cost-effectiveness.
    In this proposed system data processing, data visualisation, and data storage
    are all handled by the Big Data Analytics. This platform also manages the farm’s
    drip irrigation and lighting systems. The components for this project are deployed
    using a Raspberry Pi and Node Red. The latter is a local server with a control
    unit that uses algorithms to decide whether to use a water pump to draw water
    from a basin or from a groundwater source. By turning on and off the lighting
    and water pumps, the wireless actuator network implements BDAP choices. The farm
    and storage are powered by solar panels, a renewable energy source. The storage
    unit is in charge of keeping additional electrical energy generated by the solar
    panels and using it to run the water pumps and lighting when necessary. Whether
    to send the generated electricity to the Smart Farm or store it in batteries for
    later use is decided by the Control Unit. Data collection and data filtering are
    handled by the Cluster Controller. By regulating drip irrigation, addressing the
    electricity scarcity, and encouraging sensible water use by controlling water
    pumping, this proposed system is intended to meet the rapidly increasing demand
    for water tables. Syeda Iqra Hassan et al. [3] proposed automation in agriculture
    is a key area of development for many nations. The need for food is rising in
    line with the world’s population growth rate, which will double in the coming
    decades. Automation in agriculture is the best approach to addressing this sharp
    increase in demand. Farmers’ traditional methods are ineffective for meeting the
    escalating demand. When nutrients, water, pesticides, and fertilizers are used
    improperly, agricultural growth is disrupted and the land remains unproductive
    and desolate. The Internet of Things, Aerial photography, Multispectral, Hyperspectral,
    NIR, Infrared, and RGB cameras, as well as machine learning and artificial intelligence
    approaches are all examined in this study. By using the many automation and control
    approaches stated above plant diseases, the control of pesticides, the management
    of weeds, irrigation, and water management are all easily resolved. Automation
    using advanced control mechanisms for agricultural practises has been shown to
    boost crop yield and strengthen soil fertility. Devi kala rathinam et al. [4]
    propose India’s economy is based mostly on agriculture, which supports roughly
    70% of the population. To meet the global population’s demand for food, agriculture’s
    yield needs to be significantly expanded. Modern technology called the Wireless
    Sensor Network (WSN) is employed to deal with a number of contemporary problems.
    In many fields, including transportation, medicine, the military, mobile phones,
    home appliances, and others, WSN is crucial. All living organisms rely on agriculture
    as one of their major food sources. But due to several environmental changes nowadays,
    farm crops are suffering. WSN plays a significant function in agriculture to help
    overcome this. Here WSN is used for monitoring field, measuring temperature, controlling
    irrigation system. WSN enables the farmer to increase crop production while lowering
    yield costs. The management of soil and water may be done with using WSN. Utilizing
    wireless sensors in this case resulting in very inexpensive implementation costs.
    In this study, the crops are observed using wireless sensor nodes. Sensors can
    be used to measure temperature, humidity, and other theft indicators. Agriculture’s
    productivity is boosted as a result. Automatic processes eliminate the need for
    human work and encourage farmers to develop their farmland. Using GPS, the location
    of the farmland may be transmitted. a few elements, such as a sensor and Wi-Fi.
    Zuraida Muhammad et al. [5] proposed process of attaching equipment’s and other
    items to a network in order to share information and data. The IoT most often
    being used to link things and to gather data. Therefore, the usage of the IoT
    in agriculture is essential in modern agriculture. This work is to build a smart
    agriculture network that is integrated with the Internet of things. To deal with
    changing weather, technology is coupled with an smart irrigation system. The Microcontroller
    Raspberry Pi 4 Model B is used for this system microcontroller. The sensors like
    DHT22 sensor and soil moisture sensor are used for tracking of the temperature
    and humidity as well as the moisture content in the soil. Both a PC and a smartphone
    will be able to access the data. As a result, IoT and Smart Agriculture Systems
    based on Raspberry Pi have a great impact on farmer’s work. The production of
    agriculture will benefit from it as well. When compared to traditional irrigation
    systems, smart irrigation systems using IoT saves about 24.43 % of water annually
    in Malaysia. By doing this, labour costs might be reduced, and water waste from
    daily demands could be avoided. Shrihari et al. [6] proposed irrigation is one
    of the main issues that both scientists and farmers face while trying to automate
    agricultural production; this idea has been around since the early 1990s. A dynamic
    system, irrigation is strongly dependent on external factors. In order to create
    a smart system, the method described in this article uses a specially created
    an model to process data on Google Cloud using Wireless sensors. A design that
    can scale up to large farms and is IoT enabled. About nearly 35 people have been
    harmed by animals, according to Holistic Agricultural Studies. Tensor flow and
    deep learning neural networks are used by this intelligent system to identify
    animals according to their threat level as well as unauthorized humans who enter
    the farm and promptly inform the farmer. The gadget comes with an android application
    that enables remote access and live video streaming surveillance. H. G.C.R. Laksiri
    et al. [7] proposed another critical need for farmers in the agricultural sector
    is the creation of an efficient Internet of Things (IoT) based smart irrigation
    system. An integral cost-effective smart irrigation system based on the climate
    is created by this research. The first step is to develop an irrigation system
    that can be automatically process the required amount of water to crops based
    on the moisture content present in the soil. An IoT based communication feature
    is included to further increase the effectiveness of this water-saving irrigation
    system. This feature enables farmers to monitor the moisture level in the soil
    and controls the irrigation. The system also incorporates updated sensors for
    temperature, humidity, and rain drop size that enable online remote monitoring
    of these variables. These field meteorological parameters are continuously kept
    in a distant database. The management of water distribution is then done using
    an algorithm based on weather prediction based upon on the current weather conditions.
    With the suggested smart irrigation system, farmers can do irrigation in more
    effective. Mohammad Samunul Islam et al. [8] proposed system that will function
    in stages. First motor will be linked to the microcontroller Raspberry Pi when
    the device has been turned on. The system’s salinity, water level, soil moisture,
    and humidity sensors operate automatically based on sensor results. For the purpose
    of converting sensor’s analog values to digital values, the sensors are connected
    to an Arduino NANO. The Wi-Fi microchip module is connected to microcontroller
    for the internet. The microcontroller unit will transfer the data to the Android
    device using internet if the system mode is set to manual. The system then sends
    a push notice to the user’s Android mobile phone. And the farmer can see the sensor
    data in that notice. The farmer will act appropriately after assessing the situation
    as it stands. Alternatively, if the user selects the automatic operating option,
    the system will calculate the sensor data. Water pumps would turn on if the value
    determined is one that is suitable for irrigation. The mechanism, however, remains
    off if the value isn’t suitable for irrigation of water. Abhinav Malhotra et al.
    [9] proposed work collects data from variety of sensors, and stores it, and performs
    analysis on given data. Real-time data capturing for many aspects uses a variety
    of sensors. A PM sensor with excellent precision is SDS011. The data is gathered
    using MICS 2714, which can detect the presence of nitrogen dioxide in the air.
    Data on carbon monoxide are gathered using MQ7. Moisture measurements are taken
    using an FC28 sensor, while temperature measurements are taken with an LM35 sensor.
    For wireless communication, several Pi Zero W must be distributed together with
    the sensors. Numerous sensors will be linked to each Raspberry Pi in order to
    collect data in real time. The data is migrated to a central location, which collects
    data and produces the findings as required, the hardware connections are made.
    The even more cheap and portable microcontroller Raspberry Pi Zero W is a scaled-down
    version of the larger device. WiFi and Bluetooth are included into it. Wireless
    communication between the Raspberry Pi model and the Pi Zero W is planned. Tigor
    Hamonangan Nasution et al. [10] proposed system consists of three components sensor
    system, control system, and monitoring system. Mushroom farming is the focus of
    the sensor and control systems. The monitoring system will run by web pages, while
    the sensor node is made up of sensors that will measure the humidity and temperature
    of the field used for mushroom farming. The microcontroller Arduino Nano serves
    as the command-and-control hub for the sensor system and controllers. A lot of
    monitoring and control systems have been developed using Arduino. The SHT11 sensor
    is the one that this system uses. The output is digitally calibrated by the SHT11
    single-chip temperature and relative humidity sensor, which has many sensor modules.
    Using the Bluetooth communication device HC-05, the sensor value will be read
    and communicated to the bridge device. The information will then be transferred
    via the POST method to ThingSpeak, a cloud service. Peltier modules are utilized
    in the control system as a part of temperature regulation. The Arduino Nano will
    use a relay to activate this module when the temperature rises over 28 C so that
    temperature can be lowered. Anushree Math et al. [11] proposed method of providing
    specific amount of water at a particular time to the crops. This work deals with
    installing a sophisticated drip irrigation system on the National Institute of
    Technology (NIT) Karnataka campus to irrigate the plants. The system’s primary
    controller is the open-source platform, which is utilized to do this. Numerous
    sensors have been used to provide the most recent values of the variables that
    continuously affect the health of plants. Water is delivered to the crops at regular
    intervals by manipulating a valve, based on the information obtained from the
    RTC module. The entire irrigation system can be managed and monitored using a
    website. This website has an feature that lets you either manually or automatically
    to regulate how often plants are watered. Using a microcontroller Raspberry Pi
    camera that provides live streaming to the webpage, the health of the plants is
    checked often. Through a wireless network, the controller gets information about
    water flow from the sensor. The controller examines this data to see whether the
    pipe has any leaks. Weather forecasting is done to limit the required amount of
    water provided, making it more reliable and effective for farming. G. Sushanth
    et al. [12] proposed an IoT system is used to construct a smart agriculture system
    that uses the sensors and microcontrollers. The implementation’s purpose is to
    show off how the microcontroller can be smart and sophisticated enough to make
    decisions about when to water the crops based on monitoring of the surrounding
    environment in the field. It also provides farmers with a pre-determined irrigation
    schedule that can be put into a special application. A distributed sensors for
    soil moisture and temperature sensors placed in plant root zones make up the implementation,
    which is a photovoltaic-powered automated irrigation system. These sensors operate
    as a continuous monitoring system for the parameters, sending data to the microcontroller
    for processing. The WiFi module will be updating the data to the cloud. Through
    a connected module, the IOT gateway also offers GSM capabilities, and this receiver
    unit features an cellular-Internet interface that employs the general packet radio
    service (GPRS) protocol, a packet-oriented mobile data service utilized for mobile
    communications (GSM). Juan et al. [13] proposed work explains about the challenge
    that was solved by creating the Smart node precision agricultural technology,
    which is affordable for farmers. In this technology, the software and hardware
    platforms enable monitoring of agroclimatic factors for optimum crop production.
    To design the suggested system, the following hardware must be used: 1) Low cost,
    2) Distance: the data center is around 2 kilometers from the crop, 3) Reliable:
    communicates data collected to the central unit promptly and accurately; 4) Robust:
    withstands all weather conditions; 5) Accessibility: regional networks, the internet,
    and mobile applications, 6) Energy Efficient: uses relatively little energy while
    in use, and 7) Ecofriendly: system runs on a battery that is recharged by solar
    power. The best components were selected in accordance with these specifications
    in order to meet those requirements. The best parts were chosen so they would
    meet those requirements. There are three primary components to this project: hardware
    node, a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), and the software, which consists of a programmer
    that reads data from a USB port and a Android application. Nils Aschenbruck et
    at. [14] proposed tried-and-true approaches to deal with the two different types
    of challenges stated in the preceding section. Our main methods involve redundant
    hardware, straightforward software, and remote system control. A Wireless Sensor
    Network (WSN) based monitoring system specifically designed for assessment makes
    up the bulk of the architecture. As a result, two crucial measurement sites are
    needed: a ground-level sensor and a similar reference sensor, both of which detect
    incoming solar irradiation in the PAR range. In order to guarantee comparable
    irradiation conditions, the devices must not be placed in the same location and
    their spatial distance must not be excessive either. Routing protocols are not
    needed in the current setup. Due to the fact that cluster heads are continually
    accessible to ground sensors, time synchronization procedures are also not necessary.
    As a result, they might also modify their reference sampling to account for ground
    packet receive events. A central base station is linked to each cluster head in
    turn. Multi-hop routing may be required for these connections, depending on the
    size of the WSN, but is not yet taken into account in our deployments. Instead,
    WLAN is used to connect cluster heads. SECTION III. Execution Plan According to
    the block design as in figure 1, the execution plan will be separated into four
    components. Fig.1. Block diagram Show All These four key elements are the physical
    setup, data collection, data processing, and data analytics. The most crucial
    element for precision agriculture to prevent any unintended outcomes is the physical
    structure. The sensors, actuators, and gadgets are all controlled by the overall
    system architecture. A sensor is capable of several different functions, including
    sensing moisture, light, temperature, soil, and the atmosphere. Similar to this,
    devices carry out several control tasks like node discovery, device identification,
    and naming services, among others. Any device or sensor that is controlled by
    a microcontroller can carry out all these tasks. Any computer or remote device
    linked to the Internet can carry out this controlling function. SECTION IV. Proposed
    System Fig.2. Proposed System Show All The study’s goal is to keep track of a
    wide range of operations, including soil and plant monitoring, environmental monitoring
    (such as temperature and moisture levels), transportation, supply chain management,
    infrastructure management, control system management, animal monitoring, and also
    pest control as in figure 2 Therefore, automation needs to be used in agriculture
    to solve these issues. The Wi-Fi module is initialized when the power supply is
    turned on. The microcontroller and WiFi module talk to one another. The NPK sensor
    analyses 19 soil characteristics, including nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium,
    and advises fertilizer when the soil is deficient in these nutrients. The soil
    moisture sensor measures relative humidity, with a maximum threshold of 1000°C
    and a minimum threshold of 300°C. The pump motor will pump the water to the field
    when the amount of soil moisture is less than 300oC. The temperature sensor will
    assess the immediate environment. farm’s ambient temperature. Utilizing WSN technology,
    the user will be aware of all the aforementioned information. The mobile application
    allows the user to receive real-time field updates. SECTION V. Result and Implementation
    We are able to observe that the from beginning to end WSN system is able to quickly
    detecting soil parameters and monitoring a field in real time as in figure 3.
    If the soil moisture level is low, watering can be automated by the user using
    a mobile application. The microcontroller provides a fertilizer alarm to the user
    if the N, P, or K values are low. These results demonstrate the effectiveness,
    accuracy, and dependability of our technology as an early detection tool. examines
    how the size of the packet and the quantity of nodes in a region relate to the
    packet loss rate. Our experimental findings on communication dependability show
    that even at low moisture levels, trustworthy and consistent data transport between
    nodes is still possible. Fig.3. Result and implementation Show All SECTION VI.
    Conclusion The suggested work provides data on several soil factors, such as soil
    parameters like soil temperature, soil moisture, and humidity, in order to forecast
    irrigation appropriateness. This technology aids in the analysis of the soil’s
    properties, resulting in a more effective irrigation system for agricultural use.
    To achieve a fully automated system, machine learning techniques are used to teach
    the sensor data how to learn. Utilizing an IoT-based smart agriculture system
    improves crop quality while minimizing human labour requirements. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    Chapter © 2024 1 Introduction The main factor for the agriculture is to predict
    the weather, climatic changes and also mainly to predict that when the atmosphere
    conditions are going to change. Here, both the automated irrigation system and
    the IoT is employed for the irrigation monitoring. It will be helpful for us when
    to irrigate the crop or field at what conditions will the crop be able to sustain
    and also the other environment and also the other changes. To monitor the weather
    and climatic conditions which are varying with the time and space, so the use
    of these electrical devices in the agriculture has been increasing rapidly. So
    the use of these WSN technology is applied to the irrigation systems, and it automatically
    removes high risk to the cable line due to the automatic operations of the machines
    [1]. Due to the high cost of the WSN system modules, we are not using these type
    of technology and also it requires high energy for the data transmission between
    the client and server. So we will use the IoT and with the help of the IoT we
    are employing the several systems in the different crop fields by naming it as
    the clients and this clients, which is getting reported every time to the server
    about the status of the crop, climatic changes of the temperature, humidity, and
    also the moisture of the certain place. So that the watering and also the when
    the pesticides can be served based on the conditions on the field. The paper is
    organized as follows: Section 2 describes the literature survey. Section 3 explains
    the proposed system in which the environmental changes are controlled using IoT
    through simple message transfer protocol (SMTP) and message queue telemetry transport
    protocol (MQTT). Section 4 mentions about the hardware description. In Sect. 5,
    results are discussed. Finally, conclusion in Sect. 6. 2 Literature Survey Wireless
    sensor network and GPRS module are used in automatic irrigation system as shown
    in Fig. 1. A wireless sensor network in which the required parameter sensors are
    placed in the root zone of the crops. To transmit the information received through
    sensors, it has gate way unit and trigger acculators [2]. To know the required
    amount of water starting values of soil moisture and temperature are taken into
    consideration and algorithm is developed. It uses photovoltaic panel and cellular
    internet communication link for data transference and irrigation check. First
    and foremost, it uses expensive and complex algorithms to get the required information.
    Secondly, it doesn’t help to control the environmental changes and low-communication
    speed. Fig. 1 GPRS module in automated irrigation system Full size image 2.1 Smart
    Phone Irrigation Taking agricultural crops into consideration, irrigation sensor
    was designed. The camera captures the images of the soil and roots of the crop
    to estimate the requirement of water. To estimate the wet and dry area of the
    crop using antireflective glass window an android app was developed so that this
    app activates the device to capture the images. A Wi-Fi connection is also needed
    to control the irrigation as in Fig. 2. This model addresses a lot of issues like
    having a smart phone with a Wi-Fi connection resulting in battery issues of phone,
    poor signal and time consuming. Fig. 2 Smart phone irrigation Full size image
    2.2 Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) To get the best crop conduction, increase the
    productivity WSN is used as in Fig. 3. Many environmental parameters are sensed
    using sensors which continuously sends the data about water shortage. The soil
    conditions, need of water and climatic changes are known by using a Bluetooth
    device [3, 4]. This Bluetooth is used to transfer the information from sender
    to the receiver. Though this model is of low cost and gives the output results,
    it cannot recollect the old data, and it is less secure weather forecasting cloud
    technologies are not used. Fig. 3 Wireless sensor network Full size image 2.3
    IoT in Agriculture IoT has the ability to rule the world in many industries, smart
    cities and especially when it comes to agricultural sector it has a great wallop.
    The conventional based farming approach is too difficult when compared to smart
    farming based IoT [5, 6]. It has great advantages like less water usage, control
    over environment and updated input treatments. It makes stock man and farmers
    to get the useful data, making the farmers understand the process by installing
    the necessary smart ways to increase the productivity as in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 IoT
    in agriculture Full size image 2.4 Drone Applications of IoT in Agriculture It
    is one if the best application of today’s growing technology. It handles crop
    health, irrigation, crop records, crop spraying and soil field analysis. Drones
    get the data by insight monitoring and observations [7]. To select a ground resolution
    farmer, enter the data so that plant height measurement, yield prediction and
    so on can be identified. It is used by many organizations and one of the most
    recognized application of IoT agricultural division. It utilizes various sensors,
    control systems, robotics, automated hardware, free vehicles [8]. It adopts high-speed
    internet, mobile devices and low-cost satellites are few technological trends.
    The chance of crops being damaged will be reduced if accuracy of weather is high.
    It is used for food production and safety. Agriculture IoT not only concentrates
    on increasing the productivity of the crop and control of weather conditions but
    also takes responsibility about food security like storage transportation, etc.
    Shipping time, storage temperature and cloud-based records are monitored by this
    system. 3 Proposed System In the present system, we are using the crop field algorithm.
    So the resulting data is having the high accuracy about the environment, and also
    mainly we are using the message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) instead of
    using the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is MQTT is very much faster than the WSN.
    We are using this message queuing telemetry transport to transfer all the information
    about the climatic conditions are processed automatically, like if there is any
    possibility of rain in the weather cloud, then the climatic conditions and also
    the upcoming possibilities of the rain data log and also the current image of
    the environment will also be sent to the users mail. 3.1 Message Queuing Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT) Message queuing telemetry transport is a feather weight ISO standard
    publisher-subscriber messaging protocol specially designed for the internet of
    things. Internet of Things is creating the massive machine to machine network
    so that all of the devices like sensors, systems and also the actuators can connect
    to and communicate on the internet and with they need a communications protocol
    so that they can understand each other one of those protocols is message queuing
    telemetry transport. Message queuing telemetry transport is a TCP/IP protocol
    based on subscribe and publish messaging protocol designed for light weight machine-to-machine
    communications. MQTT has built the QoS to deliver the message. QoS 0: Once in
    a time “fire and forget,” if the device is online, it sends the message, and it
    gets delivered or if the device is offline it can’t be delivered it will be thrown
    away. QoS 1: Atleast once. QoS 2: Exactly once, 2 phase commit. Both the QoS 1
    and QoS 2 have the effectively guaranteed delivery, while the QoS 2 uses the two
    phase summit guaranteeing exactly once delivery and also it can give the end-to-end
    protocol level but not within the stacks on each side of the connection these
    QoS 1 and QoS 2 are queued for clients when the user is also online but have no
    timed out. To work the message queuing telemetry transport, it has three stages
    they are called as the message queuing broker. It is like a gateway receiver or
    server and allows the clients to send and also to receive the short messages from
    the broker only if they have subscribed to any topic like weather, temperature
    and also the humidity. Here in the below diagram, the client A is the publisher
    and the remaining client B and C are the subscribers whom receives the information
    which is sent by the sensor known as the client A. And also, these two B and C
    clients subscribe to the particular topic and gets published to the broker all
    the three will have the TCP connection with the broker as in Fig. 5. The sensor
    or the publisher which is called as the client A updates the topic and publishes
    the information about the topic to the MQ broker. These clients have subscribed
    to the topic so when the new piece of information gets published to the topic
    they then get the information from the MQ broker. Fig. 5 Message queuing telemetry
    transport Full size image 3.2 Sensor/Publisher The publisher has the information
    about the topic, and also this publisher has the data about the topic which the
    subscribers have been subscribed earlier. It is connected to the broker via TCP
    connections on all the sides whenever the new data comes, it will be sent to the
    broker. And also the publishers and also the subscribers are not connected directly
    through the TCP/IP connection. And this MQTT publishers allow username and password
    for the authentication and these clients can directly log on via password. These
    passwords are sent by the MQTT via the plain text or in encrypted form. If no
    data was sent, then the publisher will be in the off mode. The subscriber receives
    the filtered messages every message is being filtered by the broker which is the
    middle of the publisher and it also knows that who will send the message and also
    who will receive the message. The subscriber is the application based. The broker
    filter the messages based on the subject and the content based and also the type
    based filtering by the broker. A user can also subscribe to the one topics or
    more topics. When subscribed to the one or more than one topics two characters
    can be used. MQTT supports disconnect and last will and testament messages in
    this they are two types: namely hash character—multi-level wildcard and plus character—single-level
    wildcard MQTT. Clients which disconnect intentionally use disconnect message as
    in Fig. 6. MQTT broker will automatically publish last will and the testament
    messages on the behalf of the clients with unintentionally terminated messages.
    It also supports the retained messages which are automatically delivered when
    a client subscribes to the topic. Fig. 6 Block diagram of MQTT subscriber/client
    Full size image The topics which we select in the MQTT are similar to the files
    in a system using the forward slash(/). In message queuing telemetry transport,
    there is no formal structure to select the topic and a publisher is free to choose,
    it’s own topic names and also the structure but it should consists atleast on
    character to be valid. There is no topics created by the broker. All topics are
    created by a subscriber and also the publisher client, are not permanent. A topic
    only exists only if a subscriber has already subscribed to it before only or a
    broker has restore the last messages stored for that topic. This is the example
    for that E.g.: School/Room/Sensor. 4 Hardware Description Raspberry pi 3 begins
    as a toy computer and ends up being a real desktop PC having an upgraded ARMv7
    multicore processor and gigabytes RAM. In general, Raspberry pi has mode B and
    B+, mode A and A+, Pi zero. This Raspberry pi mode B and B+ are the simplest and
    cheapest but B+ has a bit more improved design of embedded applications. Raspberry
    pi zero has input or output, general purpose input or output (GPIO) and Bluetooth
    capability. They mostly operate at a frequency of 800–1000 MHz, in extreme case
    they can be operated upto 1500 MHz. In this model neither USB nor ethernet ports
    are changed. GPIO are the general purpose input and output pins which are used
    to turn off and to turn the devices like LED which will be present in the Raspberry
    pi. These pins allow you to connect and also to talk to the hardware modules that
    supports the protocol. UART is the universal asynchronous receiver and transmitter.
    It receives several bytes of the data from the GPIO pins but it transmits only
    bits of the data in the sequential order. In the asynchronous transmission of
    the data, it allows the bits to be sent or transmit without the sender but it
    will send the signal like the clock signal to the receiver side. UART can be used
    between the two devices only like simplex means data transmitted on one side only
    and also the half duplex in which the data can be transmitted in the either direction
    or the Full duplex. MPC3008 is a high performed and low power 10-bit analog-to-digital
    converter (ADC). In general to know the hotness as well as the coldness of an
    object, temperature sensor is used. In this LM 35 temperature sensor, the output
    is almost equal to the temperature. It doesn’t require any amplified output rather
    provides higher output than thermocouples. It is sometimes used as a power supply,
    battery, etc. To measure the amount of water in the soil moisture sensor is used.
    Indirectly either by using electrical resistance or neutron interactions water
    volume is measured. Light dependent resistor (LDR) is a variable light control
    resistor. As the light intensity increases, the resistance of LDR decreases. It
    can be used in circuits with light and dark activation switching and also in some
    light sensitive devices. 5 Results Figure 7 shows that the sensor parameters and
    also the weather conditions like temperature, moisture, humidity and also amount
    of light which is receiving. It compares the data log with the already existing
    weather reporting conditions. It also finds whether there is any possibility of
    the rainfall then it will intimates to the user through the registered mail. It
    will also predict the parameters like thunder storms, etc., as in Fig. 7. Fig.
    7 Message queuing telemetry transport conversation/data log Full size image These
    sensor values are being sent to the clients using the cloud and MQTT protocol.
    These parameters can be checked by the client through the registered mail. 6 Conclusion
    In this system, the irrigation system becomes more simple and easy with the quick
    transmission of the weather parameters by using the MQTT protocol and sending
    this data through cloud to the cloud who has been subscribed. The main advantage
    of using these protocol is when the client is not available then the parameters
    will be sent through the mail. When the client is available with the network then
    he can able to see the data parameters and also he can compare the present data
    with the existing data which has been already sent. So that the farmer will be
    able to know the changes in the atmosphere every day. This can also be implemented
    by using the computer-based algorithm and also the data can be processed without
    any further complexity. With the other specifications, sensors are used to make
    the process better. References J. Gutiérrez, J.F. Villa-Medina, A. Nieto-Garibay,

    India Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction In the last few years, IoT has gained
    much attention and is affecting every aspect of life. IoT is changing the way
    information is collected and being transmitted. IoT network is built with smart
    devices having processing, and communication capabilities. Embedded systems, cloud
    computing, sensors, wireless communication technologies, and web-enabled application
    are some of the backend technologies that are integrating smartness with the devices
    and making IoT implementation possible. Deployment of IoT has a great social,
    economic, and environmental impact. IoT has been deployed in many applications
    such as smart mobility, smart grid, smart homes, industrial control, and agriculture.
    Wireless communication technologies play an important role in a role providing
    the communication method between the IoT sensor nodes and also with cloud services.
    Some of the wireless communication technologies successfully deployed in IoT are
    ZigBee, RFID, NFC, Bluetooth, BLE, LTE, 6LoPWAN, Sigfox, and LoRa. Every technology
    has its advantages and disadvantages, in this article communication range and
    power efficiency of various technologies are reviewed. [1], [2] Precision Agriculture
    is yet another area emerging and gaining importance as an application of IoT due
    to the projected world population and impact of inefficient agricultural practices
    on the environment. Precision Agriculture requires monitoring of soil and weather
    conditions for better decision making. IoT adopted for Precision Agriculture uses
    wireless communication technologies for the collection of the agricultural parameters.
    The most common wireless communication technologies used in agriculture are ZigBee,
    Bluetooth, SigFox, WiFi, and LoRa [3]. In the present article popular and important
    wireless communication technologies are reviewed for their technical specification
    mainly communication range and power efficiency. The technical specifications
    of every technology have a great impact on the utilization of specific communication
    technology in IoT applications. The communication range decides how far the wireless
    node can be placed for monitoring and control, power efficiency decides the operation
    period i.e. lifespan of the wireless node. In the last, the article concluded
    with the suggestion for the suitable technologies for Precision Agriculture based
    on communication range and power efficiency. For open field monitoring and control
    applications LoRa is a good choice offering a long communication range with power
    efficiency, ZigBee is suitable for indoor or Greenhouse monitoring with short-range
    and good power efficiency. SECTION II. IOT and Wireless Communication Technologies
    IoT provides the system with the capability of monitoring and control. IoT idea
    was initiated in 1999 and was to make devices intelligent through the installation
    of sensors, processing units and giving them communication capabilities. The number
    of connected devices by IoT has been forecasted as 2000 billion by 2050. In IoT
    communication is the most important aspect and IoT mainly deploys wireless commutation
    methods for data transmission. Many wireless communication technologies are available
    for IoT with associated advantages and disadvantages. Some of the wireless communication
    technologies are Bluetooth, BLE, ZigBee, Wi-Fi, WiMax, etc. For short-range Bluetooth,
    BLE and ZigBee are used whereas LoRa and WiFi are the technologies for long-distance
    communication [1]. IoT has a wide range of applications including social gaming,
    industry, healthcare, logistics. These applications comprise smart devices that
    transmit/receive data and make the decision to help humans. For such IoT-based
    applications ICT is used for the transmission of information from human to human,
    human to machine, and machine to machine. Wireless communication technologies
    for IoT are divided or categorized into LPWAN and Short Range Network. Different
    wireless communication technologies falling under the LPWAN and Short Range Network
    are summarized in Figure 1. Figure 1 IoT wireless communication technologies Show
    All SigFox is a low-power technology capable of transmitting data up to 50 Km
    and suitable for only low data rates. Cellular is suitable for applications where
    a high data rate is desired. ZigBee supports different network topologies like
    mesh, star, tree and has longer battery life. BLE is characterized as low power
    technology and with low setup time. RFID uses preprogrammed RFID tags, which can
    be an active tag or passive tag. RFID cannot be used for direct measurement and
    diagnosis due to its preprogrammed nature. NFC uses technology almost similar
    to RFID [2]. IoT is the communication of the future by transforming real-world
    devices/objects into smart devices. IoT aims to unite every object in the work
    in such a way that humans can control them via the internet. IoT depicts the trisectional
    relationship between things, humans, and the internet as shown in Figure 2. Figure
    2 Trisectional relationship of IoT Show All It has been projected that by 2025
    about 75 billion devices will be connected over the internet and IoT will be a
    market of over $300 billion. IoT mainly communicates information via wireless
    communication technologies such as F As per records these are the people who have
    filled the form but not vaccinated to date; get it filled as otherwise they may
    not be allowed to join on campus duties RFID, LR-WPANs, Zways, LTE, LoRa, NFC,
    UWB, M2M, 6LoWPAN. Technical specifications for some of the wireless communication
    technologies are provided in table 1. Table 1 Technical Specifications of Wireless
    Communication Technologies [1] [3] [4] RFID consists of a reader and tags. Each
    tag is associated with a specific address. RFID is used for real-time monitoring
    without the requirement of line-of-sight communication with humans. IEEE802.15.4
    is the standard for LR-WPAN with the working model at 915 MHz. Z-waves are the
    communication protocol for home automation networks with low power consumption.
    Distance between 2 communicating nodes in Z-wave cannot be greater than 30 meters.
    LTE is the high-speed data transfer communication protocol with low latency and
    higher data throughput. NFC is a technology very much similar to RFID and is being
    recognized as RFID integrated into the mobile phone. NFC is a short-range, low-power
    communication technology capable of transferring a small amount of information
    between two devices. UWB is also a short-range communication technology similar
    to NFC but supports bandwidth up to 500Mhz against 13.56 MHz for NFC. LoRa is
    the communication technology used for long-range connectivity in rural areas and
    industries [3]. By 2024 IoT industry is expected to rise by a 4.3 trillion-dollar
    market with applications such as smart cities, smart homes, military, healthcare,
    farming, and many more. IoT architecture comprises four layers namely the actuation
    layer, communication layer, IoT management layer, and application layer. The communication
    layer connects the various layers in IoT architecture and transmits the sensor
    data. Based on communication range and bandwidth requirement, figure 3 shows the
    categorization of wireless communication technologies. Figure 3 IoT wireless communication
    technologies range vs bandwidth Show All The classification of different IoT wireless
    communication technologies is provided in figure 4. NFC and RFID are the technologies
    for the ultra-low range. The main difference between RFID and NFC is of the operating
    frequency range, NFC operates in medium and RFID operated in the highfrequency
    range. NFC data rate varies from 106 to 424 Kbits/s and communication range is
    from 100cm to1m while RFID communication range is 10m to 200mnwith data rate from
    40 Kbits/s to 640 Kbits/s. Bluetooth works at 2.4Ghz and is classified into 4
    classes based on communication distance. BLE or Bluetooth 4.0 has increased range
    and optimized power usage. Bluetooth 5 is also better in power utilization with
    linger battery lifetime higher data rate and speed. ZigBee and Z-wave are some
    of the other wireless communication technologies in the short-range. LoRa, NbIoT,
    and SigFox are wireless technologies for long-distance communication. LoRa and
    SigFox use unlicensed frequency and while NB-IoT operated on a licensed frequency
    band. SigFox has a data rate up to 100bps while LoRa data rate varies from 300bps
    to 37.5Kbps. Both works in the sub-1GHz spectrum. LoRa offers a communication
    range of up to 2 Km while on th3e other hand up to 15 Km while SigFox has a communication
    range up to 30Km [4]. Figure 4 IoT wireless communication technologies Classification
    based on communication range Show All In IoT, energy-efficient and reliable communication
    is an important aspect. LoRa consumes about 1-10mA of current whereas the current
    rating of WiFi is 100-350mA, Bluetooth rating is 1-35mA and that of ZigBee is
    1-10mA. LoRa offers a communication range of up to 2Km while on the other hand,
    different wireless communication technologies offer a range of about from 1-100m
    only. LoRa also offers the data security of 128 bits [5]. SECTION III. Wireless
    Communication Technologies and Precision Agriculture The world population is expected
    to grow by 9.2 billion by 2050. Which may result in food shortage. Precision Agriculture
    is the technological solution to eh sought problem of food shortage along with
    water scarcity and deterioration of soil properties. In article [6], three WSN
    narrowband IoT wireless communication technologies, NB-IoT, LoRa, and ZigBee are
    analyzed for their power consumption and communication range for applications
    in Precision Agriculture. If the range is not a constrain, ZigBee is the most
    suitable technology for agriculture applications. ZigBee falls in short-distance
    communication technology and offers the best power efficiency. But if the communication
    distance is an important factor then NB-IoT and LoRa are suitable options for
    agricultural applications. They offer a coverage range of up to 15Km. But the
    disadvantage with NB-IoT is that it comes up with a monthly subscription cost
    while LoRa works on an unlicensed frequency band. Both offer good power efficiency
    [6]. Due to the social and environmental implications, smart farming is the need
    of the modern world. Under such a situation IoT offers novel solutions and smart
    applications in the agriculture field. The data collection and its management
    through the underlying communications technologies and protocols, mainly application
    layer protocols of IoT architecture are an important aspect of IoT. Various application
    layer protocols in IoT architecture are summarized in figure 5. In terms of power
    consumption CoAP is the best followed by MQTT. The sequence of IoT application-layer
    communication protocols in decreasing power consumption is HTTP, AMQP, MQTT, and
    CoAP. When the latency is compared, irrespective of QoS (Quality of Service),
    CoAP showed less latency than MQTT. Latency of MQTT shows variance with change
    is QoS factor. As for the deployment of protocols in smart farming is considered,
    MQTT and REST protocols are used for simple and small applications such as soil
    water content measurement, controlling of water pump and measurement of atmospheric
    pressure, relative humidity, etc. For smart farming prototypes employed in medium
    and large applications MQTT, CoAP, REST, and sometimes MQTT and CoAP combinedly
    are used [7]. Applications of IoT in Precision Agriculture are elaborated in the
    article [8]. The major applications areas of IoT in agriculture are identified
    as monitoring, control, and tracking. About 70% of the study of IoT in agriculture
    is focused on, monitoring, 25% on control, and only 5% of the total work on Precision
    Agriculture are focused on tracking. Major agricultural applications or activities
    being supported by IoT are monitoring of temperature, humidity, fertilization,
    disease development, animals, water, irrigation, and monitoring of air conditions.
    In the article, the major IoT wireless communication technologies presented for
    Precision Agriculture are RFID, ZigBee, WiFi, Bluetooth LoRa [8]. WSN employed
    in agriculture fields can provide a large amount of information to farmers. WSN
    nodes are generally battery-operated and incorporate sensors and RF modules. Figure
    5 IoT Application layer communication protocols Show All Few of the IoT wireless
    communication technologies deployed in agriculture are provided in figure 6. ZigBee
    is considered the best protocol for agricultural applications. Many applications
    are developed using ZigBee such as irrigation supervision, water quality management,
    cattle localization systems, WSN-based Greenhouse, etc. ZigBeebased sensor nodes
    can communicate up to a distance of 100m. ZigBee offers good power efficiency
    when made to switch between active and sleep modes. Bluetooth is preferred for
    portable devices with a communication distance of up to 10m. Various agricultural
    applications deploying Bluetooth are weather monitoring, soil moisture monitoring,
    temperature monitoring, and irrigation monitoring. The main advantages of using
    Bluetooth are low power, availability, and ease of use by countrymen. LoRa with
    specifications as low power consumption and long-distance communication range
    is also deployed in many agriculture applications such as smart irrigation, green
    area monitoring, fertilization improvement, and many more. If power efficiency
    is looked at ZigBee, SigFox, and LoRa are the best-suited technology providing
    the best power efficiency and thereafter next comes Classic Bluetooth, WiFi and
    WiFi come under the category of high-power consumption technologies. As for communication
    range, LoRa offers a communication range up to 5Km, Sigfox up to 15Km, BLE up
    to 10m, and ZigBee, classic Bluetooth offers a communication range from 10100m.
    LoRa and SigFox are the best contenders if the cost of deployment for agricultural
    applications is considered, thereafter comes the WiFi, BLE, Bluetooth, and ZigBee
    [9]. In IoT-based smart irrigation systems, air monitoring, humidity, rain wind
    soil moisture, soil temperature, and weather forecast are important monitored
    parameters. In smart irrigation systems, the wireless communication technologies
    deployed are GSM, WiFi, ZigBee, Bluetooth, LoRa, 4G, 6LoWPAN. Among all the available
    wireless communication technologies, most of the literature is published using
    WiFi for smart irrigation followed by GSM, ZigBee, Bluetooth, LoRa, and 6LoWPAN.
    LoRa is not much exploited and is left with many opportunities in Precision Agriculture
    [10]. In article [11], the performance of WSN networks under varied vegetation
    conditions for irrigation systems is tested. The proposed system was developed
    using an ESP32 WiFi node. On the basis of coverage range and acceptable quality,
    the best results were obtained when sensor nodes are installed near the ground.
    Figure 6 Communication technologies for agriculture Show All The sensors are required
    in agriculture for collecting weather, crop, and soil information for distributed
    land for monitoring, fertilization and water requirement, and different crop requirements
    based on weather and soil conditions. Various agricultural operations/activities
    where WSN has to be used are fertilization, greenhouse monitoring and control,
    irrigation, pest control, animal and pasture monitoring, Horticulture, and Viticulture.
    The article has focused on the use of ZigBee, Bluetooth, and WiFi in Precision
    Agriculture [12]. IoT requires technologies capable of providing cost low cost,
    power-efficient, and simple solutions for end devices with wireless communication
    over a long distance. LPWAN technologies such as SigFox, NB-IoT, and LoRaWAN are
    some of the technologies that qualify the IoT requirements for end devices. LoRa
    is being deployed successfully in many applications such as wellbeing monitoring,
    traffic monitoring, smart city applications, and agriculture monitoring. LoRa
    not only offers the possibility of creating a private network but also integrates
    itself with other IoT platforms [13]. LoRa is low power and long-range wireless
    communication technology for IoT applications. Lora offers much better scalability
    than the pure Aloha protocol. For 1000 devices per gateway, LoRa losses 32% of
    the transmitted packets while Aloha 90% of the packet loss is observed [14]. LoRa
    is operated on a battery and its battery can last up to 5 years. LoRa is being
    deployed in many applications such as healthcare, industrial control, home automation,
    smart cities, environmental monitoring, smart chain and logistics, and irrigation
    monitoring and control. The proposed pump control system for irrigation uses LoRa
    as transmitting and receiver in the control unit. The control and monitoring are
    done through a mobile application developed using MIT app inventor [15]. LoRa
    is different from other suitable wireless protocols for IoT like ZigBee, NRF,
    or Bluetooth in terms of throughput, communication range, and network topology.
    The system proposed for irrigation in agriculture uses LoRa as collector and executor.
    The collector LoRa node was equipped with different sensors to collect and transmit
    the agricultural data. Executor LoRa nodes control the actuators for the irrigation
    of fields [16]. SECTION IV. Conclusion IoT with wireless communication technologies
    is providing a suitable solution to agriculture. IoT makes the system smarter
    and provides the capability of monitoring and control in different application
    areas such as healthcare, industry, and Precision Agriculture. Various IoT wireless
    communication technologies deployed in agriculture are ZigBee, Bluetooth, WiFi,
    RFID, GSM, 4G, SigFox, and LoRa. ZigBee is suitable for short-distance communication
    and offers good power efficiency and scalability but is not suitable for long-distance
    communication range. If a long communication range along with power efficiency
    and acceptable data rate is required, then LoRa is the suitable choice for monitoring
    and control of agriculture parameters. Sigfox also offers good power efficiency
    and a long communication range but is limited in data rate. IoT with wireless
    communication technologies collect the information and provides it to farmers
    related to weather, atmosphere, and soil conditions. The collected information
    helps the farmers to plan agricultural activities efficiently. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

  description: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have demonstrated research and developmental
    interests in numerous fields, like communication, agriculture, industry, smart
    health, monitoring, and surveillance. In the area of agriculture production, IoT-based
    WSN has been used to observe the yields condition and automate agriculture precision
    using various sensors. These sensors are deployed in the agricultural environment
    to improve production yields through intelligent farming decisions and obtain
    information regarding crops, plants, temperature measurement, humidity, and irrigation
    systems. However, sensors have limited resources concerning processing, energy,
    transmitting, and memory capabilities that can negatively impact agriculture production.
    Besides efficiency, the protection and security of these IoT-based agricultural
    sensors are also important from malicious adversaries. In this article, we proposed
    an IoT-based WSN framework as an application to smart agriculture comprising different
    design levels. Firstly, agricultural sensors capture relevant data and determine
    a set of cluster heads based on multi-criteria decision function. Additionally,
    the strength of the signals on the transmission links is measured while using
    signal to noise ratio (SNR) to achieve consistent and efficient data transmissions.
    Secondly, security is provided for data transmission from agricultural sensors
    towards base stations (BS) while using the recurrence of the linear congruential
    generator. The simulated results proved that the proposed framework significantly
    enhanced the communication performance as an average of 13.5% in the network throughput,
    38.5% in the packets drop ratio, 13.5% in the network latency, 16% in the energy
    consumption, and 26% in the routing overheads for smart agriculture, as compared
    to other solutions.

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have demonstrated
    research and developmental interests in numerous fields, like communication, agriculture,
    industry, smart health, monitoring, and surveillance. In the area of agriculture
    production, IoT-based WSN has been used to observe the yields condition and automate
    agriculture precision using various sensors. These sensors are deployed in the
    agricultural environment to improve production yields through intelligent farming
    decisions and obtain information regarding crops, plants, temperature measurement,
    humidity, and irrigation systems. However, sensors have limited resources concerning
    processing, energy, transmitting, and memory capabilities that can negatively
    impact agriculture production. Besides efficiency, the protection and security
    of these IoT-based agricultural sensors are also important from malicious adversaries.
    In this article, we proposed an IoT-based WSN framework as an application to smart
    agriculture comprising different design levels. Firstly, agricultural sensors
    capture relevant data and determine a set of cluster heads based on multi-criteria
    decision function. Additionally, the strength of the signals on the transmission
    links is measured while using signal to noise ratio (SNR) to achieve consistent
    and efficient data transmissions. Secondly, security is provided for data transmission
    from agricultural sensors towards base stations (BS) while using the recurrence
    of the linear congruential generator. The simulated results proved that the proposed
    framework significantly enhanced the communication performance as an average of
    13.5% in the network throughput, 38.5% in the packets drop ratio, 13.5% in the
    network latency, 16% in the energy consumption, and 26% in the routing overheads
    for smart agriculture, as compared to other solutions. Keywords: smart agriculture;
    cluster heads; energy efficiency; data security; signal strength 1. Introduction
    In various domains, the technology of wireless sensor network (WSN) [1,2,3] has
    been used in an efficient way to improve network performances. The main reason
    to uses different sensors in the environmental field due to their manageable and
    easy configuration setup [4,5,6,7]. Additionally, the sensor nodes operate autonomously
    and construct the network infrastructure in an ad-hoc manner. In such infrastructure,
    nodes have not a stable network topology and they can join the more suitable neighbor
    for data transmission based on some factors. The sensor nodes sense the observing
    data and forward towards BS with the help of some gateway and cluster heads. These
    cluster heads have a role of aggregating the received data packets and relay towards
    BS. The cluster heads effectively construct a single-hop or multi-hop path to
    BS and work as a focal point in entire data transmission. Furthermore, the cluster
    heads store the received data in its memory and follow the store and forward mechanism.
    The end-users access the centralized BS via the Internet or different web-based
    applications to retrieve the required observing data [8,9,10,11]. During data
    transmission, the deployed sensors can be static or mobile. The static sensors
    are also referred to as non-adaptive and their constructed routing tables are
    fixed. While on the other hand, the routing tables of mobile sensors are dynamic
    and frequently updated when any change incurs in the network topology. The static
    routing solutions are more secure when compared to dynamic routing; however, the
    solutions that are based on the static algorithms are not appropriate for large
    regions and network scalability [12,13]. In recent years, the technology of IoT
    has been merged a lot with other fields to improved communication in terms of
    network throughput, resource utilization, and load distribution [14,15,16]. In
    IoT, many physical objects are attached to convert the information while using
    the Internet. Moreover, the technology of WSN provides the foundation for IoT
    systems and supports in observing and forwarding the conditions for the physical
    environment [17,18,19]. Figure 1 illustrates the scenario for smart agriculture
    based on various sensors, sink nodes, BS, Internet, and users. Figure 1. Smart
    agricultural environment based on wireless sensor network (WSN). The drastic changes
    in climate negatively impact the agriculture eco-system causing heaving rains,
    droughts, floods, and abrupt weather conditions [20,21]. These changes are deriving
    threats to agriculture-related food security in the developing as well as the
    developed world. The climates related challenges that are faced by agriculture
    can be overcome by adopting smart agriculture using IoT devices, which can increase
    agriculture yields and productions. The use of sensors in agriculture has been
    introduced in the last few decades as an offline data collector [22,23,24]. The
    offline sensor infrastructure collects data and provides sufficient information
    for making good decisions to overcome future yields or for the next year crops,
    yet they are unable to provide data regarding frequent changes in the environment,
    threatening the agriculture yields. This article is aimed at using state of the
    art IoT based sensor infrastructure to collect data from the environment and securely
    transfer the data to the BS for efficient decisions. In the proposed framework,
    wireless agriculture sensors are scattered in the agriculture land for extracting
    different information related to soil composition, like humidity, temperature,
    moisture levels, and water level finders. This information is securely transmitted
    to the cluster heads, which works as memory buffers or storages to forward data
    towards BS. Upon the reception of data by the BS securely, the BS can provide
    up to date information to users for an efficient decision with minimum time. The
    proposed framework offers an energy-efficient and reliable routing to automate
    agriculture productions with minimum farmer’s burden. The observing data of agricultural
    sensors are routed towards BS intelligently and securely, which improves the monitoring
    and productivity of the agricultural land. The simulated experiments for the proposed
    framework demonstrated outperformed results when compared to existing solutions
    that are based on different network parameters. This article is outlined in multiple
    subsections: Section 2 provides the background work and problem statement, Section
    3 explains the proposed framework, Section 4 shows the simulation setup and detailed
    of parameters, Section 5 provides the experimental results along with discussion,
    and Section 6 provides the conclusion and the future work in this domain. 2. Background
    In the recent era, the technologies of WSN have been applied by different fields
    because of their low cost, easy deployment, and cost-effective environment [25,26].
    In WSN, a large number of sensor nodes are scattered in observing the field to
    sense the needed data. All of the data are gathered and forwarded towards BS via
    single or multi-hop adopted data transmission paradigm for post-analysis. Today,
    the field of agriculture performs a vital role in the improvement and economic
    growth of any country. Therefore, the field of agriculture should be exploited
    with some modern technologies, such as IoT-based WSN to reduce time and human
    efforts, and increase the agricultural throughput in the quality manner [27].
    In agriculture land, different kinds of sensors are used for determining the soil,
    weather, wetness, and temperature conditions. Although, the field of WSN has been
    exploited by many researchers in the domain of agriculture to improve its performance
    and reduce the farmer’s burden [28,29]. However, the deployed sensors have limited
    constraints in terms of memory, processing, transmitting and energy power. Besides,
    data protection is another major research challenge for WSN based applications
    because of their undependable, uncontrolled, and free-space communication foundation.
    In WSN [30,31,32], many researchers have proposed different clustering schemes
    that aimed to prolong network lifetime and efficient data transmission [33,34,35].
    In such schemes, WSN divided into various regions and each region has one cluster
    head, which aims to gather and forward the sensory information towards BS. Furthermore,
    most of the sensor nodes moved to sleep mode for prolonging network lifetime.
    Low energy adaptive cluster hierarchy (LEACH) was proposed by [36], aiming to
    introduce the concept of a cluster-based approach and improve energy efficiency
    as compared to traditional approaches. The role of the cluster head is randomly
    rotated and, accordingly, the LEACH protocol balances the energy consumption among
    the sensor nodes. In [37], the authors proposed the analytic hierarchy process
    (AHP), which aims to centralize the process of cluster head selection mechanism.
    Residual energy, mobility, and distance towards cluster centroid are considered
    to be the main factors for the selection process of cluster heads. The proposed
    solution significantly improved network lifetime in the comparison of other solutions.
    The authors in [38] proposed an energy-efficient k-means technique (EKMT) and
    determine the optimal cluster heads. The selected cluster heads are closer to
    the cluster’s member as well as the BS. The proposed solution offers to decrease
    the communication distance among nodes and improve the network lifetime. However,
    the proposed solution is not efficient in an insecure and unrestricted space environment,
    as it is open to malicious extortions and might be harmful to sensors data. Authors
    [39] proposed cluster head selection in wireless sensor networks while using a
    fuzzy environment. The proposed solution based on the fuzzy multiple attribute
    decision making (MADM) approach and uses residual energy, distance to BS, and
    the number of neighbor’s factors for selecting the cluster heads. A simulated
    network lifetime is prolonged than hierarchical agglomerative clustering (DHAC)
    [40] protocol under a homogeneous background. An improved chain-based clustering
    hierarchical routing (ICCHR) algorithm that is based on LEACH [41] consists of
    cluster formation, cluster head selection, chain formation, and data transmission
    phases. The selection and distribution of cluster heads in the proposed protocol
    are non-optimal and they cause extra energy consumption. Based on simulation results,
    the proposed ICCHR algorithm decreases the ratio of energy consumption, evenly
    distributing the load among sensor nodes. The authors in [42] proposed an optimized
    zone-based energy-efficient routing protocol for mobile sensor networks (OZEEP).
    The main aim of the proposed solution is to improve the network performance in
    terms of cluster formation and cluster head selection based on distance, density,
    mobility, and energy factors. The proposed solution achieves balanced energy consumption
    and improved network lifetime; however, the evaluation of wireless links is missing
    in the proposed solution. Moreover, security measurements are also not taken into
    consideration, which results in frequent links and routing failures. The authors
    [43] proposed the particle swarm optimization-energy efficient-based cluster head
    selection (PSO-ECHS) protocol, which prolongs network lifetime and network stability.
    In the proposed PSO-ECHS protocol, the cluster heads are selected using fitness
    function, which comprises residual energy, distance from sensor nodes to neighbors,
    and distance from sensor nodes to BS. The cluster heads are selected based on
    minimum fitness value and, afterward, the cluster formation phase is initiated.
    All of the selected cluster heads announced their advertisement message and normal
    nodes joined them to formulate the clusters. In [44], the authors proposed an
    energy-efficient centroid based routing protocol (EECRP) to achieve data transmission
    while using wireless sensor networks. In the proposed protocol, BS initiates the
    process to compute the centroid position and split the network field into various
    clusters. In the beginning, the node that is closer to the centroid position is
    selected as the initial cluster head and the role of the cluster head is shifted
    by determining the new centroid position. Besides, the proposed protocol also
    decreases the energy consumption for long-distance data communication. In [45],
    the authors proposed a secure user authentication and key agreement scheme while
    using WSN, which aims to securely monitor the agriculture domain. The proposed
    protocol is validated using Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic and the simulation
    results demonstrate better improvement in terms of security against malicious
    attacks. However, in most of the other existing works, the proposed solution also
    does not consider the performance of links in data transmission and leads to packets
    drop and latency ratio. It is seen from the discussed studies that sensor nodes
    are very limited in terms of battery power, transmission, storage, and processing
    resources. Additionally, it is not possible to replace the components of the sensor
    nodes in dense and large regions. These low powered sensor nodes have significant
    impact on the performance of the network in terms of delivery ratio and energy
    consumption. Furthermore, most of the WSN based smart agriculture applications
    need the required information in an efficient and timely manner. Therefore, optimizing
    network lifetime with stable routing and data delivery performance are most of
    the important research challenges in WSN based applications. Additionally, the
    selection of cluster heads performs a very important role to balance the load
    distribution and energy consumption in the WSN based agricultural land. The cluster
    heads that are one hop away from BS exhaust their energy resource much quickly
    and lead to the energy hole issue, which degrades network throughput and increases
    the latency ratio. Moreover, it is observed from the existing work that most of
    the solution does not consider the strength of the signal in data routing, which
    significantly increases the packet drop ratio and instability in the network region.
    Accordingly, most of the energy power of sensor nodes is dissipated due to the
    selection of poor wireless carrier channels and it leads to frequent retransmissions
    of agricultural sensors’ data. Furthermore, end users obtained the information
    from the IoT based WSN while using the Internet, which is full of malicious actions
    and network information can be disclosure to anonymous nodes. Therefore, data
    security is another important research aim for a WSN based smart agriculture to
    achieve network reliability and trustworthiness. Consequently, an energy-efficient
    and secure IoT based WSN framework must be layout and developed for smart agriculture
    to optimize network lifetime with reliable delivery performance to end-users.
    Besides, a trustworthy mechanism can increase the security of individual sensors
    and formulate realistic end-to-end routing paths. Therefore, the combined concept
    of energy efficiency with lightweight data security among the low power sensor
    nodes can improve the efficacy of the IoT-based WSN framework for smart agriculture.
    3. Proposed Energy Efficient and Secure IoT-based WSN Framework for Smart Agriculture
    Several researchers have used the technology of WSN in various domains to sense
    the environmental data. WSN has also played a vital role in the observation and
    management of agricultural land in terms of crops, climate, water usage, etc.
    However, the agricultural land still has some challenges, such as energy efficiency,
    data routing, and security, due to the limited battery power of sensors and open
    transmission medium. The basic aim of the proposed solution to develop an energy-efficient
    and secure IoT based WSN framework for the monitoring and production of agricultural
    land. In the proposed framework, an appropriate clusters heads are selected based
    on the optimal decision function. Furthermore, the SNR factor also incorporated
    in the decision to compute the strength of wireless signals and increase the successful
    ratio of sensors packets. Our proposed framework offers reliable and energy-efficient
    methods for the improvement of large-sized agricultural land. Moreover, the proposed
    framework also accumulated the data security among agricultural sensors to cluster
    heads and from cluster heads to BS based on secret keys while using the linear
    congruential generator [46,47], which requires minimal memory and processing time.
    Accordingly, our proposed framework ensures the trade-off among energy consumption,
    reliable and secure routing for the agricultural filed. The research design of
    the proposed framework is explained in this section. The proposed framework comprises
    of two main components. In the first component, the agricultural sensors are dispersed
    to gather information. The sensor nodes are heterogeneous in terms of residual
    energy, such that the energy level of the heterogeneous nodes is higher than normal
    sensor nodes. The agricultural sensors are dispersed into various distant areas
    and each area consists of one cluster head. The role of the cluster head is to
    receive the information from agriculture land and forward towards BS in a fault-tolerant
    and energy-efficient manner. The proposed framework balances the load among agricultural
    sensors and it selects suitable cluster heads based on multi-criteria decision
    function. Moreover, our proposed framework makes use of a single-hop transmission
    instead of a multi-hop paradigm to reduce the network bottlenecks and network
    latency. In the second component, the proposed security mechanism exploits symmetric
    data encryption between agricultural sensors and presents a robust transmission
    in the field using pseudorandom number generation. Figure 2 demonstrates the research
    design of the proposed framework for smart agriculture. Figure 2. The research
    design of proposed energy-efficient and secure IoT-based WSN framework for smart
    agriculture. 3.1. Network Assumptions Before discussing the proposed Energy Efficient
    and Secure IoT Based WSN Framework for Smart Agriculture, some network assumptions
    are highlighted, as follows: 𝑁 number of agriculture sensors are dispersed in
    the observing squared sized area. All the agriculture sensors and BS remain fixed
    after the nodes deployment. Transmission links are symmetric. Agriculture sensors
    are heterogeneous in terms of energy resources. BS has the most powerful node
    with unlimited resources. The location of agriculture sensors is determined using
    Global Positioning System (GPS). 3.2. Energy and Link Efficient Routing This section
    presents discussion on the design of the proposed energy and link efficient routing,
    which includes two main levels. The first level is based on a multi-criteria decision
    function for the selection of optimal cluster heads. Afterwards, the least energy
    consumption nodes are formulated into different clusters. The second level of
    the proposed energy and link efficient routing is to make the routing channel
    more stable for a longer time, which prevents the wireless link from misbehaving
    activities from cluster heads to the BS. Our proposed framework uses the node
    energy  𝑒 𝑖 , Signal to Noise Ratio 𝑆𝑁 𝑅 𝑖,𝐵𝑆 , and distance to BS 𝑑 𝑖,𝐵𝑆 as a
    multi-criteria decision-making function 𝑓(𝑛) for the selection of cluster heads,
    as given in equation 1. The aim of using SNR [48,49] is the proposed framework
    is to determine the strength of the signal and efficiently increase the delivery
    performance. SNR is defined as the ratio of the Received Signal Strength Indicator
    (RSSI) to background noise. Let us consider that 𝑅𝑆𝑆 𝐼 𝑖 is the received signal
    strength indicator and 𝐵 𝑛 𝑖 denotes the background noise for link 𝑖 accordingly,
    the value of 𝑆𝑁 𝑅 𝑖 can be computed by 𝑅𝑆𝑆 𝐼 𝑖 /𝐵 𝑛 𝑖 . The link with the least
    value of 𝑆𝑁 𝑅 𝑖 is chosen as being more appropriate for data transmission. 𝑓(𝑛)=
    𝑒 𝑖 +(1/ 𝑑 𝑖,𝐵𝑆 )+(1/𝑆𝑁 𝑅 𝑖 ) (1) The value of 𝑓(𝑛) is normalized in the range
    of [0…1] using 1− 𝑓(𝑛) . In the proposed framework, BS maintains a global table
    that comprises information regarding agricultural sensors. The store information
    consists of node position, distance from BS, residual energy and SNR factors.
    Based on the stored information, BS evaluates 𝑓(𝑛) and generates a normalized
    score. Afterward, BS chooses the highest scored sensor node in agriculture land
    as an initial cluster head. Accordingly, BS maps the entries against the nodes
    as selected cluster heads based on 𝑓(𝑛) . The rest of the nodes that are not marked
    as cluster heads are considered to be normal nodes. Subsequently, BS formulate
    the one-hop nodes from each cluster head as its member and accordingly updates
    the global table. In the proposed framework, all the agriculture sensors gathered
    the required data and forwarded it to their cluster heads. Afterward, cluster
    heads exploit a single-hop mechanism to transmit the data towards BS, which further
    interconnects to the Internet and the end-users can obtain the data regarding
    agricultural land for further analysis. 3.3. Secure Data Transmission from Agriculture
    Sensors towards BS In the proposed framework, data from the agriculture sensors
    are routed while using a secure and trusted network towards the cluster heads
    and further towards the BS. In this framework, the BS generates secret keys using
    the recurrence of the linear congruential equation that is given by Equation (2).
    𝑌 𝑛+1 =(𝛼 𝑌 𝑛 +𝛽) 𝑚𝑜𝑑 𝑚 (2) where 𝑌 𝑖 are the generated secret random values for
    sensor node 𝑛 𝑖 , 𝑚 is the modulus parameter which must be greater than 0, 𝛼 is
    the multiplier parameter and it must be greater than zero and less than the modulus  𝑚
    , 𝛽 is the increment parameter and it must be greater or equal to zero and less
    than the modulus 𝑚 , and 𝑌 0 is the seed value and it must also be greater or
    equal to zero and less than the modulus 𝑚 . Accordingly, all of the sensor nodes
    are provided secret keys using equation 2. Afterward, when the sensor node 𝑛 𝑖
    send data 𝑚 𝑖 to the cluster head CHj, it is encrypted while using Equation (3).
    𝐸 𝑗 ( 𝑚 𝑖 )= 𝑚 𝑖 ⊕ 𝑌 𝑖 (3) where ⊕ is the XOR operation between the data 𝑚 𝑖 from
    the agriculture sensor node 𝑛 𝑖 towards CHj. The encrypted data 𝐸 𝑗 ( 𝑚 𝑖 ) is
    further transmitted towards the BS, which can decrypt it by taking the XOR with
    the key 𝑌 𝑖 as given in equation 4. 𝐷 𝑗 ( 𝑚 𝑖 )= 𝐸 𝑗 ( 𝑚 𝑖 )⊕ 𝑌 𝑖 (4) 4. Simulation
    Setup with Experimental Results This section presents the default simulation parameters
    [50,51,52] that are used in the experimental analysis of the proposed framework
    against relevant solutions i.e., PSO-ECHS [43] and EECRP [44]. The simulation
    experiments are executed using Network Simulator2 (NS2) [53,54], which is a well-known
    open-source and best simulation tool to analyze network routing and communication.
    Table 1 illustrates the simulation parameters along with their default values.
    The simulation results are evaluated based on a varying number of rounds. The
    period of a single simulation round is set to 20 s. Additionally, the number of
    agriculture sensors and anonymous nodes is set to 100 and 15, respectively. All
    of the agricultural sensors, i.e., temperature sensors, light sensors, soil moisture
    sensors, location sensors, airflow sensors, etc., and anonymous nodes are scattered
    randomly. The number of agricultural sensors is set to 100. The number of malicious
    nodes is fixed to 15. Packet size (k) and payload size are set to 64 bits and
    256 bytes. The residual energy of agriculture sensors is non-uniform, i.e., 2j
    to 4j. The data traffic between the sensor nodes is a type of Constant Bit Rate
    (CBR) and a transmission range of agriculture sensors is fixed to 20 m. Table
    1. Simulation parameters. 5. Experimental Results and Discussion The section explains
    the experimental results between the proposed framework and the existing solution.
    The performance of the proposed framework with other solutions is measured based
    on network throughput, packets drop ratio, network latency, energy consumption,
    and routing overheads. 5.1. Analysis of Network Throughput with Discussion In
    Figure 3, the proposed framework is compared with an existing solution in terms
    of the network throughput under varying simulation rounds. It is seen from the
    simulation experiments that the proposed framework improved the performance of
    network throughput in comparison with the existing solutions by 10% and 17%, respectively.
    The improved performance of network throughput is due to the robust and link-aware
    cluster heads. Unlike other solutions that do not consider the measurement of
    signals strength between sensor nodes, the proposed framework incorporates SRN
    factor in an intelligent selection decision for choosing cluster heads, which
    increases the ratio of packet delivery in agricultural land due to their robust
    behavior. Moreover, the increase in network throughput for the proposed framework
    against existing solutions is due to the sharing of data encryption secret keys
    that are based on the linear congruential generator, such that proposed solution
    leads to efficient network throughput with consistent network connectivity. Additionally,
    the proposed framework measures the SNR ratio among nodes for a particular data
    transmission link, which considerably affects the transmission of agricultural
    data towards BS. Figure 3. The impact of the simulation rounds on network throughput.
    5.2. Analysis of Packets Drop Ratio with Discussion Figure 4 demonstrates the
    simulation results of the proposed framework with other solutions in terms of
    the packet drop ratio. It is observed from the results that the proposed framework
    improved the packet drop ratio by 29% and 48% when compared to the existing solutions.
    The existing solution overlooked the importance of transmission link factor thereby
    results in increasing drop rates. Our proposed framework makes use of the measurement
    of signal strength along with the residual energy of sensor nodes during data
    forwarding, which results in offering efficient routing performance. Furthermore,
    the proposed framework improves the ratio of packets delivery by evaluating the
    multi-criteria decision function and eliminating the congested nodes for data
    routing. Additionally, the proposed framework incorporates the distance to the
    BS factor and reduces the length of routing paths and achieves a better packet
    reception ratio. Besides, the proposed framework makes the data transmission more
    secure with limited computational overheads on the part of sensor nodes, which
    decreases the chances of anonymous nodes to drop the data packets and increases
    the performance of data privacy. Figure 4. The impact of simulation rounds on
    the packets drop ratio. 5.3. Analysis of Network Latency with Discussion Figure
    5 illustrates the performance between the proposed framework and existing work
    concerning network latency. It increases the chances of network dis-connectivity
    and gives rise to a network latency ratio due to the presence of malicious nodes.
    However, it is observed from the experimental results that the network latency
    ratio of the proposed framework is improved by 11% and 17%, respectively, as compared
    to the existing solutions. The proposed framework chooses the most link and energy-efficient
    cluster heads for data routing towards BS. Moreover, the proposed framework exploits
    the SNR factor to identify the ratio of the congested link and reduces the chances
    of selecting the weak node as a data forwarder. Unlike a multi-hop paradigm that
    has the chances of a lot of obstacles on each hop, our proposed framework uses
    single-hop data transmission mode. Such an obstacle not only increases the network
    latency from cluster heads to BS, but on the other hand, it also reduces the energy
    consumption, when the transmission power of sensor nodes is considered in the
    measurement of network performance. Such a dynamic decision offers a longer lifetime
    routing path and agricultural data arrives at BS in a timely and efficient manner.
    Additionally, the proposed framework exploits the direct transmission path and
    decreases the ratio of network delay instead of using the multi-hop path, which
    significantly increases the ratio of network latency due to store and forward
    mechanism. Moreover, unlike most of the existing solutions that do not consider
    data security and lead to drop the data packet by the malicious node. Our proposed
    framework presents a secure algorithm for data encryption, which helps to avoid
    the data re-transmission and explicitly reduce the ratio of network delay between
    agricultural sensors and BS. Figure 5. The impact of the simulation rounds on
    network latency. 5.4. Analysis of Energy Consumption with Discussion In Figure
    6, the performance analysis of the proposed framework in comparison of other solutions
    under varying simulation rounds is illustrated. It is seen from the simulation
    results that the proposed framework improves the ratio of energy consumption with
    other solutions by 11% and 21%. This is due to the proposed framework evenly distributing
    the load of energy consumption between sensor nodes. In the proposed framework,
    based on multi-criteria decision function an optimal nodes are selected for the
    position of clusters in agriculture land. Furthermore, the process of cluster
    heads selection and cluster formations are controlled by BS instead of in a distributed
    manner, which pointedly decreases the ratio of energy depletion in the observing
    field. Moreover, the process of recurrent re-clustering and re-routing are avoided
    by the proposed framework due to the multi-criteria decision function. The proposed
    framework significantly reduces the energy consumption in the agriculture domain,
    because the more appropriate cluster heads are selected in terms of energy efficiency,
    distance to BS, and signal strength factors. Figure 6. The impact of the simulation
    rounds on energy consumption. 5.5. Analysis of Routing Overheads with Discussion
    In Figure 7, the routing overheads between the proposed framework and other solution
    is illustrated under varying simulation rounds. The experimental results demonstrate
    that the proposed framework improves the routing overheads in comparison with
    the existing solutions by 19% and 33%, respectively. The proposed framework offers
    an intelligent decision that is based on multiple criteria for the selection of
    cluster heads with minimum processing overheads on sensor nodes. Besides, instead
    of using a multi-hop paradigm, the proposed framework exploits a single-hop pattern
    for data routing and makes use of distance to BS factor along with other performance
    parameters in routing decision. Such an approach decreases the probabilities of
    unnecessary energy consumption and overheads in data transmission. Additionally,
    unlike other solutions that maintain a local routing table on each node level
    and all the nodes update it frequently. The proposed framework maintains a global
    information table on BS and the table is updated in a controlled manner when needed.
    This mechanism expressively decreases the ratio of routing overheads and improves
    the performance of data transmission in the agriculture field. Moreover, the proposed
    framework drops the routing overheads under anonymous nodes by decreasing the
    possibility of data re-routing due to the integration of a data encryption algorithm
    based on the recurrence of the linear congruential generator. Figure 7. The impact
    of simulation rounds on routing overheads. 6. Conclusions The technology of wireless
    sensor networks performs a vital role in the development of the agriculture domain.
    This paper presents an energy-efficient and secure IoT based WSN framework for
    smart agriculture application. The main aim of the proposed framework is to appoint
    the more suitable cluster heads based on multi-criteria decision function. The
    decision is based on residual energy, distance to BS, and SNR factors. Additionally,
    the proposed framework is to adopt a single-hop paradigm for data transmission
    and decreases the chances of bottlenecks among agriculture sensors and BS. Our
    proposed framework presents an intelligent decision for data routing and decreases
    the ratio of energy consumption with improved data delivery performance in the
    agriculture field. Unlike most of the existing solutions, the proposed framework
    exploits a mechanism that is based on the SNR factor to determine the strength
    of signals and it achieves more stable network performance between agriculture
    sensors and BS. Moreover, the proposed framework offers secure data transmission
    from agriculture sensors towards BS based on secret keys while using the recurrence
    of the linear congruential generator. In future work, we aim to analyze the performance
    of the proposed framework in a mobile-based IoT network and Intelligent Transportation
    System (ITS). Author Contributions Conceptualization, K.H. and I.U.D.; Methodology,

  description: Internet of Things (IoT) has been flourishing the communication and
    networking system in recent years, while experiencing a growing phase in agricultural
    field. Precision agriculture requires sensor integration, automatic control, and
    networking and data processing capabilities. With the implementation of rapidly
    growing IoT, challenges of scalability and data management can be overcome. In
    this research, we have developed an IoT based smart monitoring system for agricultural
    practice including client application- web application and android application;
    and designed a controlling system for power efficient irrigation. We have used
    LoRa, wireless RF transceiver to overcome the limitations of area coverage and
    have enabled to established real time data communication. While our android application
    makes this system feasible for users. Real time data were collected deploying
    the system and empirical data has been included in the result section.

    the communication and networking system in recent years, while experiencing a
    growing phase in agricultural field. Precision agriculture requires sensor integration,
    automatic control, and networking and data processing capabilities. With the implementation
    of rapidly growing IoT, challenges of scalability and data management can be overcome.
    In this research, we have developed an IoT based smart monitoring system for agricultural
    practice including client application- web application and android application;
    and designed a controlling system for power efficient irrigation. We have used
    LoRa, wireless RF transceiver to overcome the limitations of area coverage and
    have enabled to established real time data communication. While our android application
    makes this system feasible for users. Real time data were collected deploying

    Location: Chittagong, Bangladesh SECTION I. Introduction Precision agriculture
    is an information and technology based site specific farming practice with the
    aim of maximizing the crop production along with the efficient usage of resources
    involved in farming process. It provides real time assessment of various crop
    and environment parameters by precising the observed farming land as well as the
    amount of required water, fertilizer and other input needs [1]. This method enables
    our farmers to achieve efficient water consumption by irrigating with proper amount
    in the required time and therefore ensures growth of non-toxic, safe and healthy
    crop [2]. But to fulfill its purpose there needs a continuous, organized and precise
    observation with the help of information technologies like Global Positioning
    System (GPS), sensors, satellites or aerial images, etc. [3]. However, scientific
    approaches should be more convenient, comprehensive, and cost efficient. In recent
    years our current technological discipline has intensely impacted by Internet
    of Things (IoT). It has been taking part in enriching almost all sectors of modern
    life and precision agronomy is a potential area which can be mostly advantaged
    by IoT [4]. Our goal is to use IoT technology to overcome the difficulties of
    adaptation in real field of existing platform and developing a cost effective
    system as well. So, on the basis of IoT and by merging variant useful technologies
    and mechanisms we have designed and implemented a smart farm monitoring and irrigation
    management system for PA. In which, sensing and measuring the variations of some
    meteorological factors (Temperature, humidity) and some soil attributes (soil
    temperature, moisture, pH), which are essential parameters for proper growth monitoring
    of crop and irrigation management are obtained by corresponding sensors. One of
    the unique features of the system is to use IoT protocol based LoRa transceiver
    for wireless and rapid communication, and long distance coverage between the gateway
    and the sensor nodes. A cloud based database with web application for data management
    and monitoring has been added to the system. Addition to the uniqueness of our
    cloud based system; we have also developed an android application, which provides
    the users their corresponding field condition in daily and weekly basis as well
    as irrigation controlling feature. In brief, features of the system are real time
    field condition monitoring, managing and analyzing data using cloud server, user
    understandable presentation using numerical and graphical plots of data on web
    application and android application, controlling the irrigation system as well
    as expandability of the platform. Consequently, by implementing our system, farmers
    can remotely obtain their field status instantly and thereby take the necessary
    decision. The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows: literature
    review will be discussed in section II and the overall system architecture, in
    section III. Methods and materials will be presented in section IV. Irrigation
    control system will be included in section V. Finally, in section VI and VII,
    result, conclusion and future work will be discussed respectively. SECTION II.
    Literature Review IoT has been emerging in the numerous field of life for the
    purpose of monitoring, data collecting, and machine controlling, security. A survey
    on IoT in smart agriculture has been presented by Mekala MS, Viswanathan P. [5].
    [6] J. Ye, B. Chen, Q. Liu, and Y. Fang have proposed a platform to implement
    IoT for PA using WebGIS. The architecture would require expertise to operate and
    develop the system. Fig. 1. Overall system architecture for smart farming Show
    All [7]T. Ojha, S. Misra, and N. Singh has highlighted the problems and challenges
    in implementing wireless sensor technology in agro-field by surveying the previously
    proposed techniques. [8] I. Mohanraj, K. Ashokumar, and J. Naren have proposed
    work on overcoming limitations of traditional agricultural procedures using IoT
    in agriculture. Nevertheless, in literature, works has been proposed on IoT in
    monitoring [2] [9] without any hardware deployment. On the other hand, WSN technology
    can be implemented in greenhouse monitoring and controlling, and in viticulture
    [10] [11]. A prototype has been developed for monitoring and prediction purpose
    based on WSN [12]. Implementation of WSN in precision farming in Egypt has been
    developed by Sherine M. Abd El-Kader [13]. Likewise, WSN has also been implemented
    in the Southern Spain for precision horticulture [14]. By studying recent works
    and their flaws of data integrity, area coverage, applicability and user amenability,
    we have developed an IoT based system for PA providing the facility of real time
    and automatic control of irrigation system as well. Moreover, existing systems
    uses Bluetooth or Zigbee [12] wireless communication protocol for data transmission
    which which are quite expensive, have less coverage area, fewer devices communicability
    and higher power consumption than LoRa which has been used in our system. SECTION
    III. System Architecture The overall IoT based agro filed monitoring and irrigation
    controlling system architecture is presented in figure 1. The proposed platform
    is designed, so that real time data are automatically obtained on a periodic basis
    or spontaneously, stored and viewed for the purpose of monitoring the field condition.
    Therefore, data acquisition, data transmission, data management and analysis,
    data visualization and controlling-these five functions defines the whole platform.
    Data from the sensor node are transmitted to the cloud server using LoRa IoT protocol
    through the gateway node which is can be located within a distance of 2-22km from
    the field where WiFi is available. Gateway needs to be connected to the Internet
    via. WiFi. However, this platform is provided with cloud based database server
    and provides API(Application Programming Interface) for data access, data import
    from the database for data visualization and the farmers i.e., authentic remote
    users can monitor the real time field condition by accessing to the server database.
    Furthermore, we have designed the monitoring and controlling interface amenable
    for the farmer by developing an android application “CropNet” which uses REST
    API services to import and export data from the database. Therefore, data from
    the database are imported to the mobile application on user''s request and again
    user can send command to control the irrigation system using this app to control
    the system. SECTION IV. Methods and Materials The system incorporates 3types of
    node: sensor node, gateway node, irrigation node; database, web application and
    android application. A. Sensor Node Design The architecture of the sensor node
    is presented in Fig. 2. Since measurement should be taken from different locations
    of the field, the sensor network should be comprised of adequate number of sensor
    nodes. Again each sensor node comprises of 4 basic units including sensors, communication
    unit, data processing unit and power unit. Our designed sensor node contains sensors
    for sensing environmental temperature, humidity, soil moisture and soil temperature.
    Moreover, Arduino Nano, Lora SX1278 IC with antenna as transceiver, and 6V power
    supply unit has been included sensor node. The hardware implementation of sensor
    node is shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 2. Sensor node architecture Show All Fig. 3. Sensor
    nodes: NODE-700, NODE-800 (hardware) Show All Fig. 4. Working flow diagram of
    the sensor node Show All Corresponding data from all sensors are collected and
    then formatted into JSON data packet. After communication is confirmed between
    the both transceivers of gateway and sensor node data packet is send to the gateway.
    The data packet can be sent within few seconds and we have configured the sensors
    to send real time data at an interval of 5min. The working flow diagram of the
    IoT sensor node is presented in Fig. 4. B. Gateway Node Gateway node has been
    designed using Node MCU 2.1 and Lora SX1278 with its antenna, router, and 6V power
    supply. It works as a medium of communication between sensor nodes and the cloud
    server. It receives data packet wirelessly using LoRa IoT protocol from the sensor
    node and posts the data packet to the cloud server via. Internet. The working
    flow diagram of the gateway node is presented in Fig. 7, where it is used as receiver,
    data coordinator and data transmitter. Block diagram and hardware architecture
    is shown in Fig. 5, 6 respectively. Since, sensor nodes and gateway node are connected
    through LoRa protocol which has large coverage area; gateway node can be located
    at any distance less than 22 km from the sensor node (LOS) which provides this
    system more flexibility for using in remote areas where Internet facility is not
    available or weak. Moreover, a repeater node containing Arduino microprocessor
    and LoRa transceiver can be used to coverage a larger area between sensor nodes
    and gateway node. We have tested the system locating the gateway node at a distance
    of approximately 1km from the sensor nodes and the data communication was successful.
    Fig. 5. Gateway node architecture Show All Fig. 6. Gateway node (hardware) Show
    All C. Data Transmission A recent development in IoT platform for low power, long
    range, wide area coverage LoRa WAn has been used here for data transmission between
    sensor nodes, gateway and irrigation node. Authors found this technology is best
    suitable for smart agriculture [15]. LoRa is a private and spread-specteum technique
    which allows sending data at extremely low-data-rates to extremely long range
    securely. The low data-rate (down to few bytes per seconds)and LoRa modulation
    lead to very low receiver sensitivity (down to −134dBm), which combined to an
    output power of +14dBm means extremely large link budgets: up to 148 dB., what
    means more than 22km (13.6miles) in LOS links and up to 2km (1.2miles) in LOS
    links in urban environment (going through buildings) [16]. Fig. 7. Flowchart of
    working of the gateway node Show All Fig. 8. Login interface of web application
    Show All Fig. 9. Nodes added to the network Show All D. User Interface Design
    User interfaces: a web application and an android application have been developed
    so that field level users can understand the system''s purpose and use them without
    difficulty. 1): Web Application FeatureCollected data from the sensor nodes are
    consumed by the database and displayed to the clients from a running query from
    database on the web application. Our MySQL server is located at pythonanywhere.com.
    This server allows us installing web2py web framework which has been used to develop
    web application. Since only the authentic users have access to the database using
    login accounts and passwords as shown in Fig. 8, users have to be authorized using
    valid emails. Here, every farmer is a user and has own dashboard where real time
    data from his registered nodes are displayed. Therefore, to get data from particular
    nodes a user need to authorize his nodes to his dashboard. We have tested a list
    of nodes in Fig. 9 by changing node ID to confirm data reception from different
    nodes added to the networks. There are web interfaces to visualise the numerical
    data of individual node(Fig. 11, 12) as well as all data of all nodes together
    (Fig. 10). Fig. 10. Neumerical data from all nodes Show All Fig. 11. Web interface
    for data from node 700 Show All 2): Android Application FeatureFor android application,
    we have successfully developed some basic interfaces and managed to pursue data
    from the database for the user. The main interface contains daily data, weekly
    data and condition analysis, irrigation cotrol sub interfaces (Fig. 13). Data
    are displayed on different interfaces (Fig. 14) so that the user can monitor farming
    condition daily as well as throughout a whole week using the weekly node data
    interface, on which all the data throughout a week are displayed. Again the average
    condition of filed will be provided in the app as in Fig. 13d. The soil pH value
    will be manually measured and users need to send the data to the server using
    the ‘PH Sensor Test’ option in Fig. 13d. We have added this feature, because we
    are working on providing solutions and suggestions for the farmers based on the
    real time data. Fig. 12. Web interface for data from node 800 Show All Fig. 13.
    Android application features Show All Fig. 14. Different interfaces of android
    application showing daily data Show All SECTION V. Smart Irrigation Scheme We
    have proposed an irrigation system which can be controlled by the user using android
    application. A node will perform as data receiver from the user through gateway
    using LoRa. Irrigation node is composed of an irrigation pump or a reservoir with
    solenoid valve, a controller circuit to operate the motor or solenoid valve, arduino
    nano, LoRa SX1278 transceiver with antenna and solar panel with solar charger
    circuit. The block diagram of the irrigation node architecture is presented in
    fig 16. According to the command the node performs automatic or force-stop irrigation.
    Automated irrigation will be performed based on the filed condition in which exceeding
    threshold level will turn on the irrigation and after a pre-determined time automatically
    will be switched off. On the other hand, the force-stop mode enables farmer to
    hold control on stopping irrigation. This mode will be helpful to save crops from
    overwatering problems as well as save energy. SECTION VI. Result and Implementation
    The whole setup was deployed in the kitchen garden of our residence (Fig. 16)
    and has been observed for two days. We have implemented two sensor nodes: NODE-700,
    NODE 800 for testing. Gateway node was placed inside the house which was connected
    Internet using WiFi. Success of the sending data from the sensor nodes and storing
    these data in the database is 99%. There are 5,164 data stored in the database
    which includes all the test level data of the system. We have shown the interfaces
    of web application and android app for numerical data visualization with real
    time data collected from field. The graphical representations of the collected
    data from NODE-700 and NODE-800 of one day are presented in Fig. 17 and 18 respectively.

    an attractive part of research because of its application in numerous fields.
    In the field of agriculture the most necessary help can be provided by this technology.
    The study is about developing a feasible system which can be adopted in every
    filed where monitoring and controlling is required. The performance of the system
    proves it relevancy and technological efficiency to implement in PA. Besides,
    we are developing the irrigation node in the mean while a prediction model for
    disease detection is being developed. The irrigation node will add a new dimension
    to the system since it will complete the cycle by including the control mechanism.
    Moreover, a predictive model for providing suggestion and treatment for different
    problems of crops will be added to the android application. We have also designed
    our goal to include a model for disease detection of crops, which will be developed
    using image processing and machine learning algorithm. Therefore, a complete platform
    will be provided to enhance the agricultural output in upcoming days. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

  description: Soil and nutrient depletion from intensive use of land is a critical
    issue for food production. An understanding of whether the soil is adequately
    treated with appropriate crop management practices in real-time during production
    cycles could prevent soil erosion and the overuse of natural or artificial resources
    to keep the soil healthy and suitable for planting. Precision agriculture traditionally
    uses expensive techniques to monitor the health of soil and crops including images
    from satellites and airplanes. Recently there are several studies using drones
    and a multitude of sensors connected to farm machinery to observe and measure
    the health of soil and crops during planting and harvesting. This paper describes
    a real-time, in-situ agricultural internet of things (IoT) device designed to

    Global Positioning System (GPS) and a ZigBee radio for data communication. The
    field trial involved soil testing and measurements of the local climate in Sao
    Paulo, Brazil. The measurements of soil temperature, humidity and conductivity
    are used to monitor soil conditions. The local climate data could be used to support
    decisions about irrigation and other activities related to crop health. On-going
    research includes methods to reduce the consumption of energy and increase the
    number of sensors. Future applications include the use of the IoT device to detect
    fire in crops, a common problem in sugar cane crops and the integration of the
    IoT device with irrigation management systems to improve water usage.

    CA, USA SECTION I. Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture can be defined
    as a set of crop management techniques created to optimize agricultural production
    to enable the efficient management of the soil, the quality of the environment
    and the crops according to the unique conditions of each planting area [1]. The
    crop area that was traditionally homogeneously managed are now organized into
    several small areas, each section receiving the appropriate treatment in order
    to increase crop production [2], [3]. Precision agriculture also requires the
    monitoring of natural and local resources of each growing area [4] in order to
    minimize the impact on the local environment and resources, and also to promote
    a sustainable food production [5]. For sufficiently large farms it is useful to
    use georeferencing information technologies to map the resources of each area
    [6]. Early developments in precision agriculture focused on collecting data on
    soil and local climatic conditions using vehicle-connected sensors (on tractors
    and harvesters which operate in field activities such as soil preparation, fertilizer
    application, harvesting, or by hand-operated portable devices,), or by satellite
    imagery. Data processing was carried out at defined time intervals that may no
    longer reflect the conditions of the soil or the crop at the moment of decision-making
    [7]. Although much of the data collection in the field are still carried out sporadically
    by vehicle-connected sensors, the necessity to control the use of agricultural
    inputs and to maximize the production using the minimum quantity of agricultural
    defensives, while at the same time not damage the environment in the productive
    area in real-time are key motivators for the development of technologies applied
    in the crops [8]. Recently there are several studies using drones [9] and a multitude
    of sensors connected to farm machinery to observe and measure the health of soil
    and crops during planting and harvesting [10], [11]. The sensing technologies,
    the geographic information system (GIS) and GPS are important technologies to
    precision agriculture [12]. Current precision agriculture devices are expensive
    and typically require a high level of technical training to utilize and interpret
    the large array of information generated making it difficult for poor uneducated
    farmers to apply them to crops [13]. With the advancement of low-cost IoT devices
    the possibility to develop custom made devices that are simple, designed with
    a particular set of functionalities to reduce cost, and are situated within crops,
    make it easier for these farmers to adopt. This paper describes a real-time, in-situ
    agricultural IoT device designed to monitor the state of the soil and the local
    environment. This device was designed to be compatible with open hardware and
    is composed of sensors for temperature and humidity of both soil and the environment,
    electrical conductivity of the soil, luminosity, GPS and a Zigbee radio for data
    communication. Customized central software received data from all devices and
    automatically located each sensor on a map using GPS. The device is powered by
    solar collector which charges a battery that allows for continuous monitoring
    of the soil and also, to send data to the central software. The data is transmitted
    using open standard protocols which make it possible to integrate the data with
    any algorithm or third party platform or system. SECTION II. Iot in Precision
    Agriculture IoT devices enables network communication, data acquisition through
    sensors and actuators, and distributed processing in a low -cost hardware which
    operate for long periods of time using low-powered batteries [14]. Agriculture
    is one of the primary industries that have embraced IoT applications since wireless
    sensors networks composed of devices that can work in coordination to cover broad
    spatial areas. The advantages of collecting data to support decision making in
    real-time to control field devices (e.g. irrigation) enables the creation of a
    robust and fault tolerance system [15]. Several IoT devices have already been
    applied to agriculture settings to monitor soil conditions such as PH and humidity
    through a wireless sensor network (ZigBee for mesh network) or using cellular
    communication system''s global system for mobile communications (General Packet
    Radio Service (GPRS). Such devices communicate with a system supported by web
    technologies and using open Application Programming Interfaces (API) or even third-party
    APls to offer georeferencing services to support decision-making [7], [16],1[7],
    [18]. The proposed prototype (figure 1) was designed only with open hardware and
    open source software, and it could be built with usual components for prototyping.
    This study investigate whether such components could be organized in such architecture
    to be effective in precision agriculture. Fig. 1. Monitoring node prototype Show
    All A. Parameters to Monitoring Soil health is an essential element to be monitored
    as unbalanced water and nutrients levels may compromise the quality of the crop
    [19]. In order to design an IoT device to monitor crops a number of essential
    parameters need to be considered. These can be categorized into four types of
    parameters: the visual, physical, chemical and biological. The visual parameters
    include changes of color of the soil, dust, water uptake or growing of weed that
    could be monitored by cameras or satellite images. Physical parameters include,
    among others, soil density, texture, humidity and soil temperature. Usually, such
    parameters are measured in the laboratory using several methods as described in
    [20] and [21]. Chemical parameters include pH, electrical conductivity and nutrients
    concentration usually measured in field or laboratory tests [21]. Biological parameters
    measure the presence of microorganisms and their influence on the soil quality
    are typically detected through laboratory testing. [22], [23]. The prototype proposed
    in this paper will monitor two physical parameters (soil temperature and humidity),
    one chemical parameter (electrical conductivity) and three physical parameters
    (temperature, luminosity, and humidity). All parameters are sent to a web platform
    at regular intervals in order to analyze the data. SECTION III. The Proposed Iot
    Device The proposed system is composed of three main components: monitoring node,
    central node, and the cloud. The monitoring nodes are installed in the several
    places in the field with sensors to monitor both soil and the environment. These
    nodes connect and send data to the central node using ZigBee network. The central
    node store data from all monitoring node and send them to the cloud through the
    internet. The central node in the cloud has a web-service with functions to receive
    data from the central node and recover data from database, among other functions.
    All nodes has a solar panel to provide enough energy to make system working and
    also charge a rechargeable battery of supply output 2500mAH and 3,7V. For that
    the available solar panel had a supply output of 10W with 6V. All nodes also has
    a Raspberry Pi 3 model B with current drain between 5mA to 10mA and up to 750mW.
    The sensors used in this prototype are broadly available in several countries,
    which permits this system could be built in anyplace with the same hardware specification.
    The cost was taken into consideration and the chosen sensors provide accuracy
    measures and measurement range to provide useful data to several soil modelling
    used in agriculture. B. Monitoring Node The monitoring node (figure 2) is composed
    of a Raspberry Pi that controls data acquisition and ZigBee communication between
    monitoring nodes and between monitoring node and central node (mesh network).
    The power source of the monitoring node is a solar panel that charges a battery
    designed to operate for several hours without the need to recharge. All sensors
    and GPS are connected in digital and analogic inputs in the Raspberry Pi shield
    and all software is written in NodeJS (open source). One sensor is used to measure
    all parameters of the soil with the specification in table I [24]. Table I. Soil
    sensor specification The environmental temperature and humidity are measured for
    one sensor with the following specification (table II) [25]: Fig. 2. Structure
    of the monitoring node Show All Table II. Environmental sensor specification The
    luminosity sensor measures the amount of light intensity in lux according to table
    III specification [26]. Table III. Luminosity sensor specification The ZigBee
    network interface has the specification depicted in table IV. This network interface
    was able to transmit 250kbps at 2,4Ghz in a distance of 100m without packet loss
    (although specification of outdoor rage is 90m). C. Central Node The central node
    (figure 3) was designed to be installed on the edge of the crop or even at the
    farm headquarter and its function is to collect data from monitoring nodes and
    store them in a local NoSQL database. This database is replicated to the cloud
    from time to time when the Central node has an available network communication
    with the cloud. The Central node also has a web interface to allow the farmer
    to check the system status and has information on the parameters collected from
    the crop. A Raspberry Pi controls the ZigBee communication between central node
    and the monitoring nodes, local information storage and the synchronization with
    the cloud. Table IV. Zigbee interface specification D. Node in the Cloud The node
    in the cloud was designed with the same technologies of the other nodes. Its role
    is to organize all information from several central nodes and provide tools to
    data correlation. All data is stored in a NoSQL database for future application.
    An API developed for this prototype controls all data exchange, including an open
    data structure transported in a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) message. The
    system has a Web Service interface that control the access to all system parameters.
    In case of any new sensor or parameter to be acquired, it is just necessary to
    include the method (software) in the Web Service interface and include a new structure
    in the database do store the new data/parameter. Such change does not imply in
    any modification in all other database structure, methods and JSON messages previously
    developed. The NoSQL database has an open source interface to allow access to
    data for decision making algorithms. The relationship between all nodes of the
    proposed system is depicted in table V. Fig. 3. Structure of the central node
    Show All SECTION I. Field Trials The field trial involved soil testing and measurements
    of the local climate in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The measurements of soil temperature,
    humidity and conductivity are used to monitor soil conditions. The local climate
    data could be used to support decisions about irrigation and other activities
    related to crop health. Table V. Relationship between nodes A. Sensors Calibration
    All sensors from the proposed device was verified to check whether their measures
    were correct compared to other measurements devices. The environmental sensors
    data was compared to a thermometer and a luximeter. The soil sensor was verified
    with a procedure described in its manual [24]. The table V presents data about
    sensors. Table VI. Sensors initial measures B. Measurementsfrom the Environment
    The measurements was obtained during a 4 hour period on one day in São Bernardo
    do Campo (city in São Paulo neighborhood) and data obtained by the IoT device
    was compared with available data from two sources: (i) The CPTEC/INPE - Center
    for Weather Forecasting and Climate Studies; (ii) Weather Underground. The data
    from CPTEC/INPE was collected in the Mirante de Santana station (in São Paulo
    city - closest station from São Bernardo do Campo). From Weather Underground the
    data was collected from a station located in São Bernardo do Campo city. The IoT
    device is installed in an area close to a dam, and usually the air humidity is
    higher compared to other areas of the city. The figure 4 presents the measured
    air temperature between 13:00 and 17:00 (GMT-3). The IoT device collected one
    measurement every four minutes. The measured temperatures were compared to the
    average temperature of CPTEC/INPE and Weather Underground (table VI). The average
    temperatures from all sources indicates the similar temperature readings compared
    to the IoT device. Taking into consideration the standard deviation from sensor,
    the IoT device could offer to the farmer accurate measurements. Fig. 4. Air temperature
    measures Show All Table VII. Air temperature comparation Localised variations
    in the environment were observed on the day of the experiment which was cloudy
    and the wind was stronger after 14:00 (from 9,3km/h at 13:00 to 16,7km/h at 16:00),
    which probably brought humidity from dam compared to the Weather Underground station
    which is located close to downtown). Fig. 5. Air humidity measures Show All Table
    VIII. Air humidity comparation With a real-time information from IoT device compared
    to other information source a decision support system could do a better control
    of an irrigation system because it would estimate the influence of the humidity
    in the crop and in the soil. The luminosity measurements (figure 6) indicates
    how much solar light the system detected during the tests. According to [27] June
    is a month with few natural lighting in the area when the system was evaluated
    compared to other areas in Brazil. Data from CPTEC/INPE indicates that the day
    of test was a cloudy day, with only some moments with sun. Although CPTEC/INPE
    did not offer measures about luxes per hours, it can be observed that the most
    luminous time of the day was in the morning up to 14:00, and after that the whether
    was cloudy again. Fig. 6. Environment luminosity measures Show All C. Measurements
    of the Soil The sensor was initially installed in 10cm depth in a sample of dry
    soil of 40cm depth. The soil sample was stored in a covered area for two month
    without any addition of water. At 16:00 the irrigation process started and it
    was operating for five minutes. As it can be observed in figure 7 the soil temperature
    was stable before the irrigation process and it decreased during the process and
    it was stable after 20 minutes. Fig. 7. Soil temperature measures Show All The
    figure 8 and 9 indicates that the volume of the water in the soil increased and
    the conductivity was higher as well. Although it is was not possible to check
    by other methods the accuracy of the equipment, the reading indicates that the
    sensor was working as expected according to the specification in [24]. The measurements
    of figure 8 indicates that soil was dry (around 2.6% of the sample contained water)
    and 15 minutes after the process the soil volumetric water as stable in 20%. Given
    the stability of the measurement, this information could be used to model if such
    level of water is adequate for different type of crop. Fig. 8. Soil volumetric
    water content measures Show All Data in figure 9 is consistent with all other
    measurements since the conductivity is directly related to the presence of water
    in the soil. Studies using the same sensor [28], [29] present similar results.
    It could be observed that soil conductivity was around zero in dry soil and changed
    fast during irrigation process. The peak occurred when the water was concentrated
    near to the sensor and the measurement was stabilized when all soil was homogeneously
    wet, since the sensor was located in the middle of the sample. However, such measurements
    were not verified using methods such as TDR [30]. Fig. 9. Soil conductivity measures
    Show All D. Tests with the Battery The tests with the battery was done fully charging
    the battery and activating the IoT device without the solar panel. It was measured
    for how much time the system could operate without fail. When the measured volts
    and current in the system did not support the fully operation of the system, it
    was considered that battery was empty (for the purpose of IoT device). Table VIII
    indicates the system elapsed time of a typical test. Table IX. Battery duration
    SECTION II. Concluding Remarks We have presented a preliminary field experiment
    of an IoT device for farmers in Brazil. Sensors detected water irrigation processes
    and the data was transmitted to a central node and then to the cloud. The initial
    evaluation indicate that the proposed IoT device could detect measurements close
    to the professional measurement devices and could react to changes in the environment
    and the soil, using open hardware and prototyping hardware and software developed
    with open source API. On-going research includes more experiments, methods to
    reduce the consumption of energy, increase the number of sensors and validation
    of the results using other calibrated sensors. Soil humidity and electrical conductivity
    will be evaluated with several kind of soil samples that are used in crops in
    São Paulo State, and results will be compared to other measurements procedures
    and techniques. The local climate data could be used to support decisions on irrigation
    and other activities related to crop health. Future applications include the use
    of the IoT device to detect fire in crops, a common problem in sugar cane crops
    and the integration of the IoT device with irrigation management systems to improve
    water usage. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by Telefonica Vivo which

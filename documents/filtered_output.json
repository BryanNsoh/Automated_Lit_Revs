It assesses the potential of improved land and water management on current croplands to meet global food security, the possible water deficits that would remain in water-scarce regions aiming for food self-sufficiency, how to meet those water deficits, and the cropland expansion required in low-income countries without the means to import the deficit.\n\nThe study finds that while the world will not exceed its carrying capacity by 2050 from a water-constrained food production perspective, there will be a net water deficit in countries facing water scarcity but also a net surplus in water-rich countries. It emphasizes the need for improved water management, irrigation expansion, and contributions from grazing lands to reduce water deficits and meet food water requirements.",

However, its potential to contribute to improving water productivity is relatively still underutilized.\u201d\n* \u201cDespite sorghum being the second most grown cereal crop in SSA, the potential of sorghum\u2019s drought tolerance to contribute to improving water productivity is relatively still underutilized.\u201d\n\nThe paper is highly relevant to the outline point because it addresses the need for scalable water-efficient practices to increase food demand.

The researchers evaluated different EI treatments, including crop residue cover, precision nutrient management, and integrated pest and weed management, and compared them against traditional farmers' practices (FP) and other deficit treatments.\n\nThe key findings of the study are:\n\n1. **Improved Grain Yield and Stover Yield:** EI practices significantly increased grain yield (7560 kg/ha) and stover yield compared to FP and other treatments. This was attributed to the compound effect of improved soil conditions, reduced competition for resources, and better bio-physico-chemical soil health over conventional farmers' practice.\n\n2. **Increased Chickpea Yield:** EI treatment also resulted in significantly higher chickpea yield (797 kg/ha) compared to other treatments. This was due to improved soil fertility and soil moisture retention.\n\n3. **Enhanced Soil Fertility:** EI practice showed a significant improvement in soil organic carbon, available nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, and iron after completion of three cropping cycles. This highlights the long-term benefits of EI practices in improving soil health.\n\n4. **Improved Soil Enzymatic Activity:** Soil dehydrogenase and phosphatase enzymatic activities were improved in EI practice over the years, indicating improved microbial activity in the soil.\n\n5. **Lower Input Energy Use and Energy Productivity:** EI practice recorded lower input energy use and higher energy productivity compared to FP. This indicates the energy efficiency of EI practices in producing crops.\n\nOverall, the study demonstrates that EI practices can significantly enhance maize-chickpea production in semi-arid tropics by improving yields, soil fertility, enzymatic activity, and energy efficiency.

Three irrigation treatments were imposed: 15 kPa, 40 kPa, and 70 kPa. The study was conducted over the 2020/21 and 2021/22 growing seasons on a commercial scale to better engage with rice farmers and industry stakeholders.\n\nThe results showed that extending soil moisture deficit beyond 15 kPa significantly delayed panicle initiation by at least 13\u201314 days, exposing rice to cold temperatures during the cold-sensitive early pollen microspore period. This reduced yield by up to 55% (4.5 t/ha) compared to the 15 kPa treatment that was not impacted by cold sterility. Irrigated water productivity and total water productivity ranged between 1.02 and 1.61 t/ML, and 0.84 and 0.93 t/ML, respectively. The highest yields (8.1 and 7.5 t/ha) were achieved irrigating at a soil tension of 15 kPa in growing seasons 2020/21 and 2021/22, respectively.\n\nThis research demonstrates that sound water productivity can be achieved with aerobic rice cultivation in temperate climates, provided cold temperatures during early pollen microspore are avoided. The quantification of the delay in crop development caused by increasing soil moisture deficit provides rice farmers greater confidence in determining the irrigation strategy and timing of pre-emergent irrigation in regions at risk of cold sterility.",

The reviewed paper also explores and summarizes recent interoperable protocols and communication standards for future IIoT ecosystems. The paper additionally presents a detailed outlook on challenges, potential solutions, and future directions for handling different interoperability issues.\n\nThe specific section of the paper that is relevant to the outline point \"Interoperability and Standardization: Key Enablers for Seamless Integration\" is Section 5 of the paper, titled \"Interoperability-Associated Architecture, Communication Protocols, and Standards.\" In this section, the paper discusses the critical role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system. The authors highlight the challenges of integrating heterogeneous data sources, devices, and systems and emphasize the need for standardized protocols and data formats to achieve seamless integration and ensure compatibility between components.

The sensors used in the proposed system collect data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and other relevant parameters at 12-hour intervals.

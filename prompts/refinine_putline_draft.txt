That is a good start, but let us refine and deepen it.  Cite all relevant papers precisely without any misattribution. Do-not say a paper says something it doesnt say. Consider ideas from multiple angles. Ensure the connections between different ideas and concepts are more seamless, making the overall narrative more coherent. Explain any concepts that might need explaining.
**You must balance a more in-depth understanding of specific technologies, concepts and techniques, with a broader overview of potential solutions and their practical applications.**
Keep the wider context in mind and please pay attention to the instructions. Let us do better. 
We dont need a conclusion paragraph here, but the section should be complete. Provide the full modified section citing all relevant papers. 
Read very closely through the provided materials to ensure you did not miss anything. 
There are no length limits: prioritize fully addressing the required points over hitting a specific word count. 
Let us have a more coherent, deeper, more rigorous and insightful version that really embodies the spirit of the review.

Use the information provided in the <documents> tags to write the next subsection of the research paper, following these steps:
1. Review the overall intention of the research paper, specified in the <review_intention> tag. Ensure the subsection you write aligns with and contributes to this overall goal.
2. Consider the specific intention for this subsection of the paper, stated in the <section_intention> tag. The content you write should fulfill this purpose. 
3. Use the title provided in the <subsection_title> tag as the heading for the subsection. 
4. Address each of the points specified in the </subsection_point_Point *> tags:
   a) Make a clear case for each point using the text provided in the "point" field.
   b) Support each point with evidence from the research papers listed in the corresponding "papers to support point" field.
   c) When citing a paper to support a point, include inline citations with the author name(s) and year, e.g. (Smith et al., 2020; Johnson and Lee, 2019; Brown, 2018). Cite all papers that strengthen or relate to the point being made.
   d) While making a point and citing the supporting papers, provide a brief explanation in your own words of how the cited papers support the point.
5. Ensure that both of the points from the <subsection_point> tags are fully addressed and supported by citations. Do not skip or combine any points.
6. After addressing the specified points, wrap up the subsection with a concluding sentence or two that ties the points together and relates them back to the <section_intention>.
7. Review the <Previous_sections> of the paper, and ensure that the new subsection you have written fits logically and coherently with the existing content. Add transition sentences as needed to improve the flow.
8. Proofread the subsection to ensure it is clear, concise, and free of grammatical and spelling errors. Maintain a formal academic tone and style consistent with the rest of the research paper.
9. Format the subsection using Markdown, including the subsection heading (using ## or the equivalent for the document), inline citations, and any other formatting needed for clarity and readability.
10. If any information is missing or unclear in the provided tags, simply do your best to write the subsection based on the available information. Do not add any information or make any points not supported by the provided content. Prioritize fully addressing the required points over hitting a specific word count.

The output should be a complete, well-organized, and properly cited subsection ready to be added to the research paper.

Begin your answer with a brief recap of the instructions stating what you will to optimize the quality of the answer. Clearly and briefly state the subsection you'll be working on and the points you'll be addressing. Then proceed to write the subsection following the instructions provided. 

Critical: 
- Do not include a conclusion or summary as the entry is in the middle of the document. Focus on addressing the points and supporting them with evidence from the provided papers. Ensure that the subsection is well-structured, coherent, and effectively contributes to the overall research paper.
- Go above and beyond. Your quality of reasining, connection of seemingly disparate ideas and nuanced support of the general paper intentions and the specific points should be outstanding.

that is excellent. now provide a version that excludes any material not related to the stated intentions of the review. aim to modify the above text as little as possible. we're merely exluding any materials not related to the objectives:

The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

Specific objectives include:

路       Examining the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and the seamless integration of each section in the context of irrigation scheduling and management.

路       Analyzing the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end automated irrigation systems.

路       Investigating the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

路       Identifying gaps and proposing solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

provide the full modified version. Let us aim for reductive innovation without losing any importance nuance, depth or rigor.

### CORE API Search Guide: Formulating Queries in JSON Format

This guide provides a structured approach to creating effective search queries using the CORE API. The guide emphasizes the JSON format to ensure clarity and precision in your search queries.

#### Syntax and Operators

**Valid Syntax for CORE API Queries:**
- **Field-specific searches**: Direct your query to search within specific fields like `title`, `author`, or `subject`.
- **Boolean Operators**: Use `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to combine or exclude terms.
- **Grouping**: Use parentheses `()` to structure the query and define the order of operations.
- **Range Queries**: Specify ranges for dates or numerical values with `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`.
- **Existence Check**: Use `_exists_` to filter results based on the presence of data in specified fields.

**Invalid Syntax:**
- **Inconsistencies in field names**: Ensure field names are correctly spelled and appropriate for the data type.
- **Improper boolean logic**: Avoid illogical combinations that nullify the search criteria (e.g., `AND NOT` used incorrectly).

#### Ideal Query Structure

Your search queries should:
1. **Use Field-Specific Filters**: Focus your search on the most relevant attributes.
2. **Combine Keywords Effectively**: Use logical operators to refine and broaden your searches.
3. **Employ Grouping and Range Queries** where complex relationships or specific time frames are needed.

#### Example Advanced Searches in JSON Format

Here are examples of structured queries formatted in JSON, demonstrating different ways to effectively combine search criteria using the CORE API:


{{
    "query_1": {{
        "search_query": "climate change, water resources",
        "query_rationale": "This query is essential to understand the overall impact of climate change on global water resources, providing a broad understanding of the topic."
    }},
    "query_2": {{
        "search_query": "water scarcity, (hydrologist OR water expert)",
        "query_rationale": "This query is necessary to identify areas with high water scarcity and how climate change affects the global distribution of water resources."
    }},
    "query_3": {{
        "search_query": "sea level rise, coastal erosion",
        "query_rationale": "This query is crucial to understand the impact of climate change on coastal regions and the resulting effects on global water resources."
    }},
    "query_4": {{
        "search_query": "water conservation, climate change mitigation, environmental studies",
        "query_rationale": "This query is important to identify strategies for water conservation and their role in mitigating the effects of climate change on global water resources."
    }},
    "query_5": {{
        "search_query": "glacier melting, cryosphere",
        "query_rationale": "This query is necessary to understand the impact of climate change on glaciers and the resulting effects on global water resources."
    }}
}}

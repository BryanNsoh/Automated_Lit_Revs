  <role>You are an AI assistant tasked with improving a research paper draft.</role>
  <paper-draft>
    <description>The draft is very text-heavy and needs to be diversified to be more engaging. Each section needs one or more graphics, tables, etc., to break up the text and make it more diverse.</description>

    <description>You are provided with some sample review papers to get an idea of how papers have been structured and some sample visuals they have used, as well as the way they present certain types of information and structure the text.</description>

<task>
  <objective>Your job is to figure out the ideal visuals for each section of the paper draft. Remember, we don't want too many visuals, just a few that do heavy work. Suggest where they will go, what text chunks they will replace, and their precise format.</objective>
  <visual-description>
    <requirements>
      <item>When describing the visuals, be thorough and detailed. Describe the visuals down to the last detail, including what information should be included, what specific data will go in, and what questions would have to be asked to get that information from the research paper.</item>
      <item>Create a comprehensive mockup of the visual that comes as close to the real deal as you are able to using the information already in the paper. Use an appropriate tool (e.g., TikZ, or another suitable method) to create the mockup as though you were really attempting to create the final version.</item>
    </requirements>
  </visual-description>
  <placement>
    <requirements>
      <item>Suggest the placement of each visual within the paper.</item>
      <item>Suggest what text you'll be replacing with the visual.</item>
      <item>Suggest a caption for each visual.</item>
    </requirements>
    <goal>It should be very easy for someone to go and complete the visual with no extra context other than your mockup and description of what should be included.</goal>
  </placement>
  <text-modifications>
    <description>Correct the surrounding text to remove information that's going into the visual and make it point to the visual when making its arguments.</description>
    <process>
      <item>Go through the paper section by section.</item>
      <item>For each section, propose the new modified graphic, table, or other visual along with its modified text.</item>
      <item>Move on to the next section and repeat the process.</item>
    </process>

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.


The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

paragraph_index: 1
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
paragraph_index: 2
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
paragraph_index: 3
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
paragraph_index: 4
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
paragraph_index: 4
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
paragraph_index: 5
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
paragraph_index: 6
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
paragraph_index: 7
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
paragraph_index: 8
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
paragraph_index: 9
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
paragraph_index: 10
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
paragraph_index: 11
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
paragraph_index: 12
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
paragraph_index: 13
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
paragraph_index: 14

The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
paragraph_index: 15

Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
paragraph_index: 16

Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices. 
paragraph_index: 17

Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
paragraph_index: 18

Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
paragraph_index: 19

Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
paragraph_index: 20

The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
paragraph_index: 21
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
paragraph_index: 22

Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
paragraph_index: 23

Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
paragraph_index: 24

The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
paragraph_index: 25

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
paragraph_index: 26

Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
paragraph_index: 27

The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
paragraph_index: 28

Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
paragraph_index: 29

The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).

Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
paragraph_index: 36

Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
paragraph_index: 37

Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
paragraph_index: 38

In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
paragraph_index: 39

Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
paragraph_index: 40

To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
paragraph_index: 41

Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.

Addressing the Challenges
paragraph_index: 43

Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
paragraph_index: 44
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
paragraph_index: 45
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.

paragraph_index: 47
Real-time irrigation management systems heavily rely on the efficient and reliable transmission of data from sensors and weather stations to the cloud for processing and decision-making. However, agricultural environments present unique challenges to wireless communication, including adverse weather conditions, physical obstacles, and the limitations of wireless technologies. These challenges necessitate robust and adaptive solutions to ensure the consistent and timely flow of data, enabling truly autonomous irrigation scheduling.
paragraph_index: 48
Environmental factors, such as heavy rain, fog, and strong winds, can significantly disrupt wireless communication by attenuating or even blocking radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance (Ed-daoudi et al., 2023; Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). Dense vegetation, buildings, and uneven terrain create further complications by causing multipath propagation and shadowing effects (Yim et al., 2018; Gautam and Pagay, 2020). The study by Yim et al. (2018) on LoRa networks in a tree farm environment exemplifies these challenges, revealing reduced communication range and data reliability compared to theoretical expectations. This underscores the need for carefully selecting and optimizing communication protocols and network parameters to ensure reliable data transmission in such environments.

The study by Guzinski et al. (2014a) using a modified TSEB model further highlights the importance of high-resolution data in accurately capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of energy fluxes influenced by environmental factors. This emphasizes the need for advanced data acquisition and processing techniques that can effectively represent the complexities of agricultural settings.
paragraph_index: 50
The limitations of traditional wireless communication technologies, such as limited range and network congestion, pose additional challenges for large-scale agricultural operations. Long-distance data transmission can be hindered by range limitations, while network congestion arising from numerous sensors transmitting concurrently can lead to delays and data loss, hindering real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). Addressing these challenges requires the exploration of advanced networking technologies that can optimize spectrum utilization, mitigate interference, and improve reliability and efficiency.
paragraph_index: 51
Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) offer promising solutions for optimizing wireless communication in agricultural settings. CRNs empower devices with the ability to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). Research has explored the potential of CRNs in predicting Radio Frequency (RF) power to avoid noisy channels and optimize spectrum utilization (Iliya et al., 2014; Iliya et al., 2014). These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of combining optimization algorithms with artificial neural networks (ANNs) to enhance the accuracy and generalization of RF power prediction, enabling CRNs to make informed decisions about channel selection and avoid interference.
paragraph_index: 52
DSA complements CRN technology by dynamically allocating unused spectrum, further enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion (Shi et al., 2023). The numerical model developed by Shi et al. (2023) showcases the potential of CRNs and DSA for optimizing wireless communication in challenging environments.
paragraph_index: 53
The integration of CRNs and DSA into the IoT network architecture requires careful consideration of spectrum sensing techniques, network topology, and data security. Research on cooperative spectrum sensing suggests that distributed approaches, where sensor nodes collaborate and share information, can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of spectrum sensing, particularly in dynamic environments (Trigka and Dritsas, 2022; Khalid & Yu, 2019). This collaborative approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the radio environment and facilitates the identification of available frequency bands for data transmission.
paragraph_index: 54
The choice of network topology also impacts the performance and scalability of CRN-based irrigation systems. Mesh networks, where sensor nodes are interconnected and relay data for each other, offer enhanced resilience and coverage compared to star topologies where nodes communicate directly with a central gateway (Akyildiz & Vuran, 2010). However, mesh networks can be more complex to manage and may introduce additional routing overhead. The trade-off between network resilience and complexity needs to be carefully evaluated to select the most appropriate topology for a specific agricultural setting.

Data security and privacy are paramount concerns in IoT-based irrigation systems due to the sensitive nature of agricultural data (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential for protecting data integrity and ensuring system trustworthiness. Research on secure spectrum leasing and resource allocation algorithms for CR-WSN-based irrigation systems has demonstrated the potential of these technologies for enhancing security and efficiency (Hassan, 2023; Afghah et al., 2018).
paragraph_index: 56
In conclusion, the development of effective and reliable real-time irrigation management systems requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the challenges of data transmission in agricultural environments. The integration of robust and adaptive communication protocols, optimized network architectures, and advanced networking technologies like CRNs and DSA, along with a focus on data security and privacy, can contribute significantly to achieving the goal of autonomous and efficient irrigation scheduling.

Implementing robust access control and authentication mechanisms is essential to protect this data from unauthorized access and potential cyberattacks. Studies by Alyahya et al. (2022) and Gaba et al. (2021) emphasize the importance of secure authentication frameworks and communication protocols in preventing data breaches and ensuring system trustworthiness. Furthermore, research by Kotal et al. (2023) explores the use of privacy-preserving data generation algorithms and policy enforcement mechanisms to ensure data confidentiality while enabling big data analysis for improved agricultural productivity.
paragraph_index: 88
Looking towards the future, the integration of automated irrigation with advanced precision agriculture technologies holds the potential to further revolutionize agricultural practices and address the challenges of food security and resource scarcity. AI-driven crop modeling, employing machine learning and deep learning algorithms, can provide predictive insights into crop growth, yield potential, and resource requirements (Sharma, Jain, Gupta, & Chowdary, 2020; Pero et al., 2023). This information can be used to optimize irrigation scheduling, fertilizer application, and other agronomic practices for enhanced crop productivity and resource use efficiency. Robotics and autonomous vehicles hold the potential to automate various tasks within the agricultural workflow, including planting, weeding, and harvesting (Alaba, Jegede, Sani & Dada, 2024). By integrating these technologies with automated irrigation systems, farmers can create a truly autonomous and data-driven agricultural ecosystem, leading to improved efficiency, reduced labor costs, and enhanced sustainability.
paragraph_index: 89

The increasing reliance on IoT-based automated irrigation systems necessitates a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity. These systems, while offering numerous advantages in terms of efficiency and precision, present unique security challenges due to their interconnected nature and the potential for malicious actors to exploit vulnerabilities.
paragraph_index: 100
Unique Security Risks and Vulnerabilities
IoT-based automated irrigation systems are vulnerable to a range of cybersecurity threats, including:
•	Unauthorized Access and Data Breaches: The remote access capabilities of these systems, while convenient for monitoring and control, create potential entry points for unauthorized individuals (Ammar & Russello, 2022). This vulnerability can lead to the manipulation of irrigation schedules, disruption of water flow, and unauthorized access to sensitive data, potentially compromising farm security and leading to economic losses (Gupta et al., 2020). As highlighted by William (2022), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), which form the foundation of automated irrigation systems, are susceptible to both cyber and physical attacks. Understanding and addressing these threats is crucial for ensuring the overall security and reliability of irrigation systems.
•	Data Tampering and Injection: The integrity of sensor data and control signals is paramount for accurate irrigation decisions. Malicious actors may attempt to tamper with or inject false data into the system, leading to suboptimal irrigation practices and potentially harming crops or wasting water (Ammar & Russello, 2022; Gupta et al., 2020). Such attacks can have severe consequences, leading to crop failures, water scarcity, and economic losses for farmers.
•	Malware and Ransomware: The proliferation of interconnected devices in IoT-based irrigation systems increases the risk of malware and ransomware attacks. These attacks can disrupt system functionality, compromise data integrity, and even render the entire system unusable, potentially crippling agricultural operations and causing significant financial damage (Gupta et al., 2020).
•	Supply Chain Vulnerabilities: The complex supply chains of IoT-based irrigation systems, involving various hardware and software components from multiple vendors, introduce additional security risks. A compromise at any point in the supply chain can have ripple effects throughout the system, potentially introducing vulnerabilities or backdoors that can be exploited by attackers (Gupta et al., 2020).

paragraph_index: 101
These vulnerabilities are further amplified by the dynamic and distributed nature of agricultural environments. Factors such as limited connectivity, reliance on wireless communication, and the remote location of many farms create additional challenges for securing these systems.
Best Practices and Strategies for Securing Automated Irrigation Systems
To mitigate these risks and enhance the security of automated irrigation systems, several strategies and best practices can be implemented:
•	Secure Device Provisioning and Authentication: Implementing strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication and hardware security modules, is crucial for preventing unauthorized access to the system (Ammar & Russello, 2022; Jin, 2023).

•	Encryption and Secure Communication Protocols: Employing robust encryption algorithms, such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), and secure communication protocols, such as TLS and DTLS, is essential for protecting data confidentiality and integrity (Bacco et al., 2019). This ensures that data transmitted between devices and the cloud remains secure and cannot be intercepted or tampered with by unauthorized individuals.
•	Regular Firmware and Software Updates: Implementing a regular update schedule for firmware and software on all system components is critical for addressing known vulnerabilities and mitigating emerging threats. This proactive approach ensures that the system remains up-to-date with the latest security patches and reduces the risk of exploitation (Ammar & Russello, 2022; Jin, 2023).
•	Network Segmentation and Access Control: Dividing the irrigation system network into smaller, isolated subnetworks can limit the impact of a security breach by preventing attackers from gaining access to the entire system (Ammar & Russello, 2022; Jin, 2023). Access control mechanisms, such as role-based access control, further enhance security by granting users access only to the information and functions necessary for their roles, minimizing the risk of accidental or intentional misuse.
•	Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems: Implementing intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) can provide real-time monitoring of network traffic and system activity, identifying and blocking suspicious behavior (Ammar & Russello, 2022; Jin, 2023). These systems can be based on signature-based detection, anomaly-based detection, or a combination of both, and can be deployed at various points within the network to provide layered security.
•	Security Audits and Penetration Testing: Regularly conducting security audits and penetration testing can identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the system before they can be exploited by attackers. Security audits assess the overall security posture of the system, while penetration testing simulates real-world attacks to identify potential entry points and weaknesses that need to be addressed.
•	User Awareness and Training: Educating farmers and irrigation managers about cybersecurity best practices is crucial for minimizing human error and promoting a culture of security awareness. This includes training on password hygiene, phishing awareness, and safe computing practices. By empowering users with the knowledge and skills to identify and prevent cyber threats, the overall security of the system can be significantly enhanced.
•	Incident Response Planning: Establishing a comprehensive incident response plan is essential for effectively handling security incidents and minimizing their impact. This plan should outline procedures for identifying, containing, and recovering from cyberattacks, as well as communication protocols for notifying stakeholders and coordinating response efforts.
By adopting these best practices and strategies, automated irrigation systems can achieve a higher level of security and resilience, ensuring the reliable and sustainable operation of these critical agricultural systems.

7. MONITORING AND ENSURING SYSTEM RELIABILITY

7.	 
MONITORING AND ENSURING SYSTEM RELIABILITY
paragraph_index: 102

Automated irrigation systems rely on a complex network of sensors, actuators, controllers and software to optimize water delivery. Ensuring the robustness and reliability of these systems is critical to avoid costly disruptions and maintain optimal crop health. This section focuses on key strategies and techniques for monitoring system status, building in resilience against faults and failures, and implementing closed-loop control to adapt to changing conditions.
7.1. Resilience and Fault Tolerance in Automated Irrigation Systems
paragraph_index: 103
A fundamental approach to enhancing irrigation system resilience is to incorporate redundancy of critical components (Smith, 2023). This includes deploying multiple soil moisture sensors at different depths to provide a reliable picture of moisture levels, installing backup controllers that can take over if the primary unit fails, and utilizing multi-path communication protocols like mesh networks that maintain connectivity when individual nodes go down (Hashmi et al., 2024). Longo et al. (2021) emphasize the importance of failover mechanisms that detect primary component failures and seamlessly switch to standby backups, minimizing operational disruptions.
paragraph_index: 104
Looking ahead, AI-driven self-healing systems could further boost autonomous management of faults. Park et al. (2023) propose using reinforcement learning to automatically identify failure patterns and reconfigure components to avoid repeat issues. Bayesian networks could pinpoint the likely causes of faults to enable targeted recovery, while self-organizing maps could uncover anomalous sensor readings indicating potential failures (Yanani, 2018). Integrating these adaptive capabilities would allow irrigation systems to autonomously detect, diagnose and recover from problems.\
paragraph_index: 105
Distributed architectures and edge computing also contribute to system resilience by decentralizing key functions and data flows (Karnehm et al., 2024). Processing sensor data at the edge reduces reliance on continual cloud connectivity. Even if a central failure occurs, edge devices can maintain localized irrigation control (Jain, Kumar, & Sharma, 2023). Multi-agent frameworks allow autonomous fault recovery, with individual agents responding to issues in their local domains (Puligundla et al., 2022).
paragraph_index: 106
Proactive approaches offer another layer of resilience. Shafi et al. (2023) demonstrate how unsupervised learning can uncover anomalies in datasets that warn of impending faults. Predictive maintenance models analyze historical data to anticipate failures before they occur. LSTM networks, CNNs and gradient boosting have shown promise in forecasting fault conditions (Al-Sarayreh et al., 2023; Wu, Zeng, & Zhang, 2023). Acting on these insights enables targeted interventions that prevent system downtime.
paragraph_index: 107

Achieving a truly robust automated irrigation system requires a multi-faceted approach incorporating physical redundancies, intelligent self-management, decentralized architectures, and predictive capabilities. As these technologies mature, irrigation networks will be able to autonomously ensure their own reliability and health.
7.2. Advanced Monitoring Techniques for Automated Irrigation Systems
paragraph_index: 108
The ability to continuously monitor conditions in the field and across the irrigation system itself is vital for managers to optimize interventions and quickly respond to any issues. IoT sensor networks provide real-time data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and more (Chamara et al., 2023). Integrating computer vision expands these capabilities. Multispectral and hyperspectral imaging can capture detailed information on crop health, growth stage, and stress that is not apparent to the naked eye (Eron et al., 2024). Deep learning algorithms can then identify features like individual plants, locate disease or pest impacts, and assess overall canopy status (Chamara et al., 2023).
paragraph_index: 109
Getting this data to users is the next key step. Chamara et al. (2023) show the advantages of edge computing models where initial image processing is done on devices like a Raspberry Pi before transmission, which reduces bandwidth demands. Cloud-based platforms provide further opportunities to aggregate and analyze data flows from across large deployments. Open communication protocols like MQTT and CoAP enable data from diverse sensors to be efficiently transmitted to the cloud (Jain et al., 2023). With this real-time information accessible remotely, managers can understand dynamic field conditions and make timely decisions.
paragraph_index: 110
Novel techniques are also emerging to provide even richer insight into overall irrigation system health. Entropy-based measures, network resilience indices, and multi-criteria decision frameworks can turn raw data into intuitive performance metrics (Khaddar & Boulmalf, 2017). Fusing data from sensors, weather stations, satellites and other sources via Kalman filters or Dempster-Shafer methods generates a holistic view of operations (Ahmed et al., 2022). Mulyandi et al. (2022) highlight how data visualization, potentially even in AR/VR environments, can make this wealth of data actionable for managers.
paragraph_index: 111
Effective monitoring is not just about flashy displays, however. Underlying data quality is critical. Proper calibration of sensors, correction for measurement drift, and removal of faulty readings are vital preprocessing steps (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Kalman filtering and other data cleaning techniques can correct for gaps and outliers in incoming data streams (Mohammed et al., 2021). Getting data in standard formats is also key for integrating varied sensors and readouts. Interoperability and metadata standards allow monitoring components to work seamlessly (Jabbar et al., 2020).
paragraph_index: 112
Cybersecurity is another fundamental consideration in large-scale monitoring systems. IoT sensors are notorious for security vulnerabilities that could allow malicious actors to disrupt operations (Gupta et al., 2020). Encrypting data transmissions, using secure authentication protocols, and isolating sensor networks from other system components are best practices to mitigate risks (Aliyu et al., 2021). Anomaly detection algorithms can also identify suspicious patterns in data or commands that may indicate an attack.
 
paragraph_index: 113
By combining cutting-edge sensors and computer vision with robust data processing, intuitive visualization, and strong security, monitoring solutions can give managers unprecedented real-time insight into the inner workings of automated irrigation systems. These tools are the foundation for implementing data-driven control and optimization strategies.
7.3. Closed-Loop Control and Feedback Mechanisms
paragraph_index: 114
Monitoring field conditions is only half of the equation. Automated irrigation systems must also be able to continuously adjust their operations based on the insights generated from that incoming data. Closed-loop control makes this possible by creating a feedback loop between sensors and actuators (Navarro-Hellín et al., 2016). As sensor readings detect changing moisture levels, weather conditions, or crop health, controllers dynamically adapt scheduling and flow controls to maintain optimal growing environments.
paragraph_index: 115
A variety of closed-loop control techniques have been successfully applied in precision irrigation. Rodríguez et al. (2015) demonstrate how PID controllers can use soil moisture sensor data to iteratively adjust toward a target water content range. McCarthy et al. (2014) take things a step further with model predictive control, which forecasts how adjustments will play out to find an optimal schedule over a given time horizon. Fuzzy logic is another approach that works well for systems with less precise data, as it can interpret "vague" sensor readings and output human-readable control recommendations (Mousa & Abdullah, 2014)
paragraph_index: 116
Closed-loop automation has delivered impressive results in the field. Klein et al. (2018) combined satellite imagery analysis and precision valving in a vineyard irrigation system that increased yield by 26% while using 16% less water compared to manual methods. Liakos et al. (2017) leverage multiple soil moisture sensors and localized sprinkler control in an olive orchard to reduce water use by 30% without impacting yield.
paragraph_index: 117
Machine learning is pushing closed-loop performance even further. Reinforcement learning allows systems to automatically adjust their control policies based on results, essentially allowing them to learn optimal scheduling through trial-and-error (Mohd-Sidi & Lescourret, 2011). Genetic algorithms can test huge numbers of possible system configurations in simulated environments to identify strategies that maximize efficiency and crop performance (Sanchez-Chavez et al., 2019).
paragraph_index: 118
User input still has an important role to play in guiding closed-loop automation. Farmers can provide initial scheduling constraints, define preferences, and input expert knowledge through web dashboards or mobile apps. Engaging interfaces make it easy for managers to visualize AI recommendations and understand automated system decisions. Two-way communication between irrigation systems and their human operators builds trust and allows for continuous performance improvements (Cancela et al., 2015).
paragraph_index: 119
Irrigation is not a set-it-and-forget-it operation. Conditions are constantly shifting, and automated systems need to be able to adapt on the fly. By "closing the loop" between sensing and control, irrigation managers can achieve unprecedented levels of precision, efficiency, and resilience (Yan et al., 2018). As the computing power behind these strategies continues to grow, self-optimizing irrigation systems are becoming a reality.
paragraph_index: 120
The future of automated irrigation management depends on reliable monitoring, intelligent controls, and user-friendly interfaces. By building resilient sensor networks, leveraging the latest data analytics, and implementing adaptive closed-loop automation, these systems can help tackle water security challenges and drive agricultural productivity to new heights. There is still much work to be done in refining these tools and techniques, but the technologies emerging today point the way to a more sustainable irrigation future.

  <overall-strategies>
    <strategy>Consolidate repetitive paragraphs making the same point into concise, focused units conveying main ideas efficiently.</strategy>
    <strategy>Where similar material is covered in multiple sections, cross-reference to prior discussion and focus on introducing new elements rather than repeating extensively.</strategy>
    <strategy>Avoid redundant citations by grouping discussion of key insights from each study into focused paragraphs.</strategy>
    <strategy>Use clear paragraph topic sentences and structure to ensure each paragraph has a distinct, non-repetitive purpose.</strategy>
    <strategy>Within paragraphs, cut repeated points or slight rephrasings in favor of succinct, linear presentation of key information.</strategy>
    <strategy>Improve specificity and informativeness by excising generic, often-repeated points and focusing on particular findings, solutions, or examples.</strategy>
    <strategy>Restructure overarching document flow to clearly delineate section scope and avoid repetition. Introduce each key idea only once, at the most relevant point. Eliminate redundancy in Introduction, streamline shared methodological considerations, and consolidate insights in Conclusion.</strategy>

  <analysis-instructions>
    <step1>Analyze the entirety of the text in <paper-draft>.</step1>
    <step2>For each paragraph:
      <substep1>Provide the paragraph index.</substep1>
      <substep2>State the key idea of the paragraph.</substep2>
      <substep3>List the index of each other paragraph in the entire document where the same key idea is mentioned.</substep3>
      <substep4>For each instance of the repeated idea, provide a one-sentence note of how the idea is mentioned and whether it is in a unique context or merely repetition.</substep4>
      <substep5>Suggest a consolidation action (e.g., remove the idea from the current paragraph and place it in paragraph X, delete the current paragraph entirely, or vice versa).</substep5>
      <substep6>List all previous paragraphs that referenced the current one and their recommended consolidation actions.</substep6>
    </step2>
    <step3>Compile the recommended edits for each paragraph/table into an overall restructuring plan, keeping track of all addition, removal, and relocation suggestions.</step3>
    <step4>Use the following YAML format for the analysis of each paragraph/table. If it is a table being analysed use table in the paragraph_index field i.e table 1:

- paragraph_index: current paragraph index i
 section: current section x
 subsection: current subsection x.x
 first_3_words: "Word1 Word2 Word3"
 key_idea: "The main idea of the paragraph"
 
 key_point_referenced_elsewhere_in:
 - paragraph_index: Y ( paragraphs from other sections (3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8) should be analyzed)
   section: x ( paragraphs from other sections (3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8) should be analyzed)
   subsection: x.x ( paragraphs from other sections (3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8) should be analyzed)
   context: "Brief description of how the key idea of this paragraph is mentioned in paragraph Y. Remember, any paragraph from sections 3 to 8 can be mentioned here. This analysis is not restricted to the current section. You are encouraged to closely analyze paragraphs from other sections (3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8) in addition to the current section."
   another_unique_point: "State another unique point in the text where the same or similar key idea is mentioned, including paragraphs from sections 3 to 8. This analysis is not restricted to the current section."
   consolidation_action: 
     - "Consolidate the material from paragraph Y here in paragraph X"
     - "Remove the repeated content from paragraph Y"
     - "Relocate the content from paragraph X to paragraph Y"

 - paragraph_index: Z
   section: z
   subsection: z.z
   context: "Brief description of how the key idea of this paragraph is mentioned in paragraph Z. Remember, any paragraph from sections 3 to 8 can be mentioned here. This analysis is not restricted to the current section. You are very very strongly encouraged encouraged to closely analyze paragraphs from other sections (3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8) in addition to the current section."
   another_unique_point: "State another unique point in the text where the same or similar key idea is mentioned, including paragraphs from sections (3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8). This analysis is not restricted to the current section."
   consolidation_action:
     - "Remove the repeated content from paragraph X"
     - "Relocate the content from paragraph Z to paragraph X"

 - paragraph_index: A
   section: section a
   subsection: subsection a.a
   context: "Brief description of how the key idea of this paragraph is mentioned in paragraph A. Remember, any paragraph from sections 3 to 8 can be mentioned here. This analysis is not restricted to the current section. You are very strongly encouraged to closely analyze paragraphs from other sections (3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8) in addition to the current section."
   another_unique_point: "State another unique point in the text where the same or similar key idea is mentioned, including paragraphs from sections (3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8). This analysis is not restricted to the current section."
   consolidation_action:
     - "Move the content from paragraph X to paragraph A"
     - "Consolidate the material from paragraph A here in paragraph X"
     - "Remove the repeated content from both paragraphs X and A"
    </step4>

	<imperative1> Every single word of your response must be in this yaml format and only in this format. no words outside of this format are permitted. You are to analyse everything from section 3 up until section 8 in this way. do-not stop until you are done. The paragraph indices are used for pointing to other paragraphs that have presented the same information redundantly. use them well. You may say things like point adequately covered in sectionx, subsection x.x, paragraph index x. Delete from here. Or add here and delete in paragraph index x if neccesary. If there is repitition, state the precise point at which the repitition happens. be extremely precise about it<\imperative1>
	<imperative2>Pay very special attention to the mentioned in and references by sections. if the kwy point of a particular paragrapd is mentioned elswhere or the paragraph in quesiton is referenced by some other paragraph we absolutely do want to know about it. Do-not leave this section empty unless there is a reason(i.e the current key point is not referenced elsewhere in the text or the current paragraph has not yet been referenced by any other. You are encouraged to reference future as well as previous paragraphs. Precise, comprehensive and detailed cross referencing and cross examination is crucial for the analysis</imperative2>

  <closing>
    The goal is to rigorously eliminate redundancy, ensure each paragraph efficiently conveys new insights, and restructure the document to establish a cohesive, linear flow. Trimming repeated points in favor of a tight, systematic presentation of the most salient findings will yield a more incisive and impactful review. Consider the entire document context when analyzing each paragraph to identify all instances of repetition and opportunities for consolidation. All individual paragraphs and tables must me similarly analyzed. Don't stop until you're done. Begin from section 3 and end at section 8. Provide the full analysis

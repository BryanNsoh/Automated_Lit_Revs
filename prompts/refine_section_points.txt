<review_intention>
the purpose and intention of this systematic review on automated systems for real-time irrigation management can be interpreted as follows:
Addressing the global food challenge: The review aims to explore how automated, real-time irrigation management systems can contribute to the efficient use of water resources and enhance agricultural productivity to meet the growing demand for food.
Evaluating the current state and future potential: The primary objective is to critically assess the current state of end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. The review also seeks to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
Examining automation across the entire pipeline: The review intends to systematically analyze the automation of each component of the irrigation management pipeline, from data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action. It aims to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end automated irrigation systems.
Highlighting the role of interoperability and standardization: The review seeks to emphasize the importance of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. It aims to identify existing and emerging standards and their applicability to real-time irrigation management systems.
Identifying challenges and proposing solutions: The review intends to uncover the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. It aims to propose solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations.
Guiding future research and innovation: By identifying research gaps and proposing new research questions and hypotheses, the review aims to provide a roadmap for advancing the field of real-time, automated irrigation management. It seeks to encourage collaborative research efforts across disciplines to address the complex challenges of automated irrigation systems.
In summary, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food challenge."""

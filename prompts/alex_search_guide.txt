Syntax and Operators
Valid syntax for advanced alex search queries includes:
Using quotation marks %22%22 for exact phrase matches
Adding a minus sign - before terms to exclude them
Employing the OR operator in all caps to find pages containing either term
Using the site%3A operator to limit results to a specific website
Applying the filetype%3A operator to find specific file formats like PDF, DOC, etc.
Adding the * wildcard as a placeholder for unknown words
`
Invalid syntax includes:
Putting a plus sign + before words (alex stopped supporting this)
Using other special characters like %3F, %24, %26, %23, etc. within search terms
Explicitly using the AND operator (alex's default behavior makes it redundant)

Ideal Search Structure
An effective alex search query should:
Start with the most important search terms
Use specific, descriptive keywords related to irrigation scheduling, management, and precision irrigation
Utilize exact phrases in %22quotes%22 for specific word combinations
Exclude irrelevant terms using the - minus sign
Connect related terms or synonyms with OR
Apply the * wildcard strategically for flexibility
Note:

By following these guidelines and using proper URL encoding, you can construct effective and accurate search queries for alex.

Searches should be concise yet precise, following the syntax rules carefully.

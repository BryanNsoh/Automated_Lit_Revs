2024-04-29 16:07:02,331 - root - INFO - Scraped content: Vines for wine production are commonly cultivated under regulated deficit irrigation, i.e. the vines (Vitis vinifera) are maintained in a state of mild-sever, controlled drought stress in order to enhance the quality of the yield and the wine. The plant water status can be estimated via measurements of the Stem Water Potential (SWP) using Scholander pressure chamber. The objective of the present work was to demonstrate the application of Model Predictive Control (MPC) for managing grapevine irrigation via midday Stem Water Potential at two levels: (1) MPC was used to determine SWP reference values for the whole season, and (2) MPC was used to estimate twice a week the irrigation required to achieve the desired SWP.
However, image acquisition is known to be time and labor consuming and does not enable to feasibly construct a daily time series of grapevine water status. A unique model was also developed by Gips et al (2020) to optimize SWP reference values throughout the growing season based on historical data and expected profit considering value of yield at harvest and irrigation costs. However, the outcome of this model may serve as a benchmark, and not as an indication of the actual water status of the vineyard.
Estimating vine water status is essential for achieving the desired balance between wine grape quality and yield in viticulture management and irrigation planning. The growing demands of smart farming for extracting meaningful information from field data to support irrigation decisions may be facilitated using field monitoring technology along with advanced modeling algorithms. This research took place in a Vitis Vinifera cv. “Sauvignon Blanc” experimental plot within a commercial vineyard. The main objective was to generate a water stress estimation model for wine grapevines based on data fusion from multiple sensors. Data were collected using sensors from five monitored grapevines, each treated with a different water stress regime. The sensors provided measurements of trunk and fruit growth, leaf temperature, and soil water content (SWC) at depths of 20 and 40 cm. Additionally, meteorological station in the vineyard recorded the temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation. A daily-scale multivariate time series was composed using the data derived from the sensors. Stem water potential (SWP) values were measured for the monitored vines and analyzed against the multivariate time series of factors to define their interrelations and interactions. Finally, a prediction model for SWP estimation was defined using boosted regression trees (BRT) algorithm, with an optimized set of factors. Validation was conducted using comparative statistics between a randomly selected test set and a predicted set of SWP values achieved using the trained BRT model. After processing the data and eliminating most of the factors due to multicollinearity, the model was composed of daily maximum leaf temperature (LT), SWC at noon at 40 cm, tree water deficit (TWD), SWC daily amplitude at 20 cm, water input, vapor pressure deficit, and phenological stages. The highest contributor to the BRT model was maximum LT (44.5%), followed by SWC at noon at 40 cm (16.9%) and TWD (16%). The model performance was estimated using various measures and resulted in a correlation of 0.9 between the estimated SWP values and the test set. No significant differences were found between their means (t = -0.31, p-value = 0.76) and distributions (D = 0.13, p-value = 0.77). The RMSE was 0.16 MPa which corresponds to a 12% error when normalized to the range of the test set. The suggested sensor fusion approach for estimating SWP is a promising technique that integrates representative factors of the soil–water-plant-atmosphere continuum; it should be further examined in different climate regimes and vine varieties.

2024-04-29 16:13:54,001 - root - INFO - Content: Agriculture is a major consumer of freshwater, in particular in countries like India. From the perspectives of crop yield and water conservation, the development of advanced model-based irrigation scheduling methods is desirable. Most of the farming in India is done by small-scale farmers and to serve their needs, we are developing a simple model-based system that can be applied semi-manually and does not need expensive sensors and costly data. In this article, an optimal irrigation system, based on Model Predictive Control (MPC), which uses a physics-based model to compute an optimal amount of irrigation for the next day, is developed. The robustness of the developed system is tested by comparing the effect of errors in a key model parameter as well as in the weather forecast.

2024-04-29 16:13:54,003 - root - INFO - Content: In open-channel irrigation systems (OCIS), most of the water is lost by seepage and leaks. However, the reported control strategies for OCIS are not focused on leaks and seepage minimization. Therefore, aiming to contribute to the reduction of waste of water, in this paper, an efficient control approach for OCIS, capable to reduce the waste of water by up to 50%, is presented. The proposed strategy is a nonlinear model predictive control that operates under request mode, which has been designed using a simplified modeling approach capable to describe the behavior of the OCIS along a broad operation region. The proposed strategy has been tested using a well-known test bed of the literature, and the results show that, by using this strategy, an appropriate amount of water can be supplied to the users, and the waste of water can be significantly reduced.

Irrigation canals are the constructed channels connected by different control structures to convey water from supply sources to farmers, municipal, industrial, and outdoor recreational uses according to a specific schedule. It is crucial that the conveyance canal and its related structures can be designed and operated to perform their functions efficiently and satisfy user demands and minimize costs and water loses. The objective of this chapter is to introduce the current knowledge on irrigation canal design, canal model, canal control, and canal optimal management. The design standards and processes for an irrigation canal are summarized to include the Best Management Practices to deal with seepage losses. The hydrological and hydraulic model of the system and their integrated model are the basic tools to better understand the water movement and balance of the canal system. An irrigation canal hydraulic model can be developed using the Saint-Venant equation combined with the flow control internal boundary conditions to provide fast and accurate prediction to simulate flow states change with time and space in the canal system. The soil and water assessment tool is the popular tool for understanding the hydrological processes in the irrigation canal watershed and the irrigated field. The integrated hydrological and hydraulic models have been established to deal with the reservoir-based irrigation system and estimate the seepage losses for the irrigation canal system. Canal control methods, canal flow routing algorithm, and automatic canal control are introduced to improve canal operation with better controls on frequency, flow rate, and duration of their water supply. A lot of irrigation systems have been modernized with automatic technology to improve system efficiency and management effectiveness of every component of the system (reservoirs, canals, and gates). A set of model predictive control (MPC) approaches of automatic control techniques have been summarized for different application’s optimization to optimize the canal operation. The MPC is the power tool to determine the control actions that maintain water levels after disturbances to obtain the system-wide multiple variable optimum performance. In summary, the innovation of automatics and improved hydrological and hydraulic models provide an opportunity to leverage the optimal management on the irrigation cannel. The development of more complex algorithms with nonlinear prediction models and the consideration of uncertain or errors are possibilities to be explored to validate the controller in the actual irrigation canal.

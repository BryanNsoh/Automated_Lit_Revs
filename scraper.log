2024-05-24 16:31:51,170 - root - INFO - Content: Recent advances in computer technology have been made possible the development of Expert Systems. Expert Systems are special computer software applications that are capable of carrying out reasoning and analysis functions in narrowly defined subject areas at proficiency levels approaching that of a human expert. The prime targets for the development of expert systems applications in agriculture are the narrowly defined subject areas which have experts available for solving problems. All commercial crop production systems in existance today are potential candidates for Expert Systems. These Expert Systems would take the form of integrated crop management decision aids which would encompass irrigation, nutritional problems and fertilization, weed control-cultivation and herbicide application, and insect control and insecticide and/or nematicide application. Additional subject areas of potential are plant pathology, salinity management, crop breeding, animal pathology, and animal herd management. The advantage of Expert Systems is that once developed they can raise the performance of the average worker to the level of an expert.
This chapter explores the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in precision agriculture also known as smart farming. Precision agriculture utilizes advanced technologies and AI algorithms to collect and analyze vast amounts of data from various sources, such as drones, satellites, sensors, and farm machinery. The integration of AI in precision agriculture enables farmers to make data-driven decisions, optimize resource allocation, and enhance crop productivity while minimizing environmental impact. The chapter discusses the applications of AI in data collection and analysis, crop monitoring and management, weed and pest control, and autonomous farming. It highlights the benefits of precision agriculture using AI, including increased productivity and yield, resource efficiency, cost reduction, and environmental sustainability. However, challenges related to data quality and integration, infrastructure, technical expertise, and ethical considerations need to be addressed for the agrochemicals widespread adoption and responsible implementation of AI in precision agriculture. The chapter concludes by emphasizing the importance of continued research, collaboration, and regulatory frameworks to unlock the full potential of AI in revolutionizing agriculture practices and ensuring global food security.
Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) have already brought unprecedented success in the detection of various diseases of plant leaves, fruits, buds, flowers, etc. Besides, computer science and related field researchers are widely trying to use specific ML and DL methods to classify images and get better results in the field of agriculture and technology. Considering these, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) have been applied in this research. We first applied the Gaussian filter and the Median filter separately on the main dataset and saved the filtered images into two separate directories. We then applied two color models (HSI and CMYK) separately to the images in each directory. Thus, we pre-processed the images in four different ways with the main objective of finding the best combination of the filtering methods and the color models. We then applied our selected DCNN models to each output obtained from the pre-processing steps and finally chose the best methodology based on the accuracy. At last, we have found the highest accuracies (98.27% in Vgg-19, 94.98% in MobileNet-V2, and 99.53% in the ResNet-50) by using the Gaussian Blur and the Gaussian Noise filters with the RGB to CMYK color conversion method.
Digital Twins are a novel approach to systems engineering that can help control complex environments and interface humans with them. This is achieved by digitally mirroring a physical asset to provide historical data, monitoring, and predictions of future states. While there are a few applications of Digital Twins to agriculture, none exist for post-harvest grain handling. However, there have been past attempts at integrating computer assistance in grain quality, called expert systems. These systems were largely abandoned due to their inability to keep operators in the loop and the inadequacy of sensors available during the time of expert systems research. By utilizing Digital Twins and modern post-harvest sensors, operators can be provided with a digital representation of inventory and the quality of grain as it moves throughout a facility. This virtual representation also presents a unique opportunity to enhance market traceability. This review focuses on (1) expert systems, their history, and limitations, (2) the history of Digital Twins and their applicability to grain storage and handling, (3) unit operations and the sensors that are common to grain handling facilities, (4) mathematical and computer models to simulate grain handling operations, and (5) a conceptualization of post-harvest Digital Twins, which identifies research gaps where critical questions should be answered if Digital Twins technology is to be considered a logical contender for traceability of commodities post-harvest.
Expert systems have been used in numerous application areas. Examples of these include facial feature identification [66], medicine [67,68], education [69] and agriculture [70]. Multiple types of expert systems have been developed using different technologies.
Prior work introduced a gradient descent trained expert system that conceptually combines the learning capabilities of neural networks with the understandability and defensible logic of an expert system. This system was shown to be able to learn patterns from data and to perform decision-making at levels rivaling those reported by neural network systems. The principal limitation of the approach, though, was the necessity for the manual development of a rule-fact network (which is then trained using backpropagation). This paper proposes a technique for overcoming this significant limitation, as compared to neural networks. Specifically, this paper proposes the use of larger and denser-than-application need rule-fact networks which are trained, pruned, manually reviewed and then re-trained for use. Multiple types of networks are evaluated under multiple operating conditions and these results are presented and assessed. Based on these individual experimental condition assessments, the proposed technique is evaluated. The data presented shows that error rates as low as 3.9% (mean, 1.2% median) can be obtained, demonstrating the efficacy of this technique for many applications.
The rules processing engine scans the knowledge base for rules whose preconditions are satisfied and runs them, setting the value of designated postcondition facts. Expert systems have found use in numerous fields including medicine [21,22], power systems [23], facial feature identification [24], agriculture [25], education [26] and geographic information systems [27]. A variety of enhancements have been proposed to expert systems, including different optimization techniques [28] such as using genetic algorithms and principals related to neural networks.
Artificial intelligence systems, which are designed with a capability to learn from the data presented to them, are used throughout society. These systems are used to screen loan applicants, make sentencing recommendations for criminal defendants, scan social media posts for disallowed content and more. Because these systems do not assign meaning to their complex learned correlation network, they can learn associations that do not equate to causality, resulting in non-optimal and indefensible decisions being made. In addition to making decisions that are sub-optimal, these systems may create legal liability for their designers and operators by learning correlations that violate anti-discrimination and other laws regarding what factors can be used in different types of decision making. This paper presents the use of a machine learning expert system, which is developed with meaning-assigned nodes (facts) and correlations (rules). Multiple potential implementations are considered and evaluated under different conditions, including different network error and augmentation levels and different training levels. The performance of these systems is compared to random and fully connected networks.

2024-05-24 16:31:51,209 - root - INFO - Content: Traditional timer-based systems for irrigation management, which are more commonly used in commercial nurseries in South Africa, are not ideal as they may not irrigate seedlings efficiently. A sensor-based irrigation system is presented as an alternative, as this can provide several benefits to nurseries and nursery-grown seedlings. Small-sized soil water sensors that could fit in small-volume nursery containers (25 to 100 mL), and could be integrated into an automated irrigation system, are reviewed. Several experiments have been conducted internationally to measure soil water status of small-volume containers in soilless substrates, and a large body of knowledge is now available. In this review, we describe the principles of several currently commercially available sensors that can be adapted to this purpose, giving advantages and disadvantages of each type. We conclude that a sensor-based irrigation system has great potential to address the challenges associated with irrigation scheduling, while improving water usage in most nurseries.

Retail demand for emergency contraception in United States following New Year holiday
This article discusses the use of autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models for time series analysis. Rather than forecasting future values, we focus here on examining change across time in outcomes of interest and how this change is related to relevant variables.
Much of the data that we collect about the world around usstock prices, unemployment rates, party identificationare measured repeatedly over time. By failing to account for the linked and time dependent nature of these data, common analytic techniques may misrepresent their internal structure. If we wish to describe patterns over time or forecast values beyond the observation period, we need to account for how current values may depend on previous values, trends may exist in the data, or data may vary seasonally. To visualize this, consider an electrocardiogram. The readings expected at a given moment depend not only on the preceding values but also on the position within the entire cycle. For example, following the P wave, we would expect to see the QRS complex. The assumption that each reading is unaffected by preceding values would be valid only in the most distressing circumstances (that is, during fibrillation or after death).
To incorporate this complex nature of time series data into models, Box and Jenkins introduced the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model.1 As the name implies, this model contains three different components: an autoregressive (AR) component, a differencing for stationarity (I) component, and a moving average (MA) component. The first component allows the outcome at a given moment to depend on previous values of the outcome. As this model requires a time series with properties that do not vary across time (that is, a stationary time series), the second model component (integrated) allows researchers to subtract previous observations to obtain a stationary time series, if needed. The third component (moving average) models the error term as a combination of both contemporaneous and previous error terms.
Box and Jenkins proposed an iterative process of modeling time series data that contains three steps. The first stage (identification) involves transforming the data if needed, obtaining a stationary time series though differencing, and examining the data, autocorrelations, and partial autocorrelations to determine potential model specifications (that is, order of the autoregressive, integrated, and moving average components). The second step (estimation) estimates the time series model with the sets of potential model parameters and then selects the best model. For example, in the linked paper (doi:10.1136/bmj-2023-077437),2 we used the bayesian information criterion and Akaike information criterion to select the best fitting model from among candidate models. The model that best fitted the data, an ARIMA(1,1,1) model, had order one for each term (autoregressive, integrated, and moving average). This means that we model the change in sales between week t and week t-1, a first difference. The model also includes the previous weeks value as a predictor of this change (autoregressive order 1) and an error term that is composed of the contemporary weeks and previous weeks errors (moving average order 1). Alternative specifications for the ARIMA model would correspond to the number of differences necessary to construct a stationary time series model, the number of previous values to include as predictors, or the combination of previous errors included in the error for a given observation. The third step (diagnostic checking) examines the model for potential deficiencies and, if any are found, restarts the process. Although not without critiques,3 this modeling approach remains popular today. Field specific texts can provide a helpful introduction to the topic for most readers. For example, we found a text by Becketti helpful in the preparation of the linked paper.4
The model and process described above allow researchers to explore change in an outcome over time. But what if you think some other variable is affecting your outcome of interest? In many modern computer packages, estimated from the ARIMA model described above can be adjusted with a set of exogenous X variables that also vary across time. The resulting model is often referred to as a regression with ARIMA errors, as the estimated regression includes an error term that is an ARIMA process.
ARIMA models have previously been used to explore time dependent processes in population health. For example, recent work has used ARIMA models to explore disease diagnosis or outcomes and demand for medical services.5678 ARIMA models or, more generally, regressions with ARIMA errors are commonly used for time series data for a few key reasons. Firstly, the model allows us to incorporate relations between observations. For example, the spread of an infectious disease through a population likely depends on previous counts of infection in the population. Consequently, hundreds, if not thousands, of papers applied ARIMA models to counts of infection or death from the covid-19 pandemic, tracing the spread of the disease over time in settings around the world. Enabling data to incorporate dependencies in terms of lags or seasonality allows researchers to better fit such data. The second key benefit of estimating regressions with ARIMA errors is that it allows us to explore changes relative to the underlying background trends in the data. In our case, sales of levonorgestrel emergency contraception have been increasing over time in the United States.9 A basic model exploring weekly sales as a function of the dichotomous holiday indicators might not correctly differentiate the sales increase following the New Year from such a background increase.
ARIMA modeling remains popular today, although researchers must recognize some limitations. Firstly, these models may require relatively long time series, with a common rule of thumb being at least 50, or preferably 100, observations to estimate seasonal components. Although this is not a challenge to frequently measured values or long running time series, it may limit the acceptability of ARIMA models in some cases. Secondly, the described model estimation process fits a model form, specifically the order of autoregressive and moving average terms, to the observed data. Although useful in describing the observed time trend, fitting the ARIMA model this way may limit its utility in describing trends in other contexts. Finally, as with all models, ARIMA models should be examined as one possible model. In some cases, alternative models may better fit observed data,10 so examination of the data and model specifications is essential before selecting a modeling approach.
Regressions with ARIMA errors can be useful tools to understand time series data. By incorporating linkages between observations, and exploring change across time, these models can both describe trends and explore how these trends vary with predictors of interest.

The general application of agricultural IoT is to set up a large number of sensor nodes, so that a monitoring network can be formed, collecting information through a variety of sensors to help agricultural workers with the identification of problems. The adoption of agricultural IoT will transform agriculture from a human-dependent production mode into an information-based and software-centric production mode, involving the extensive use of various automated and intelligent production equipment. This chapter introduces the concepts of standards, standardization, and standard systems at length and summarizes the concept of the agricultural IoT standard system. Finally, it offers a brief introduction of the standards and specifications involved in each layer of the agricultural IoT system.

IoT refers to the ubiquitous network consisting of ubiquitous end devices and facilities, including sensors with intrinsic intelligence, and mobile terminals. IoT is simply defined as the exchange of information between things and things of the same attribute. In todays world, IoT enables interactions between objects with different attributes or different systems. For example, in agricultural IoT, the production and processing of agricultural products are seemingly completely unrelated, but food safety traceability can fully realize the interaction of these two kinds of different information. To achieve the seamless connection of information, interaction between these two dimensions must share an inevitable and unique correlation, and the standardization of information is the only way to complete the seamless connection of information in different spaces and dimensions.
Against the backdrop of the rapidly maturing IoT technology, an ever-larger giant network of information is being formed. Every object and every person circulate in this network as an information element that comes with unique features. The linking of different behaviors, attributes, and events depends on the standardization of information within the network. Information standardization is the foundation for promoting the vigorous growth of information technology and also the prerequisite for information sharing. Broadly defined, information standardization involves not only the expression of information elements but also the entire processing of information, including information transmission and communication, data flow, information processing techniques and methods, information processing equipment, and so on. The high-speed development of IoT technology and the advanced integration of information must follow unified standards and rules. Standardization is inevitable to the development of IoT. Furthermore, such standardization is conducive to the standardization and interoperability of various industries in different industries and different business processes, thus facilitating IoT connection and the related ubiquitous information network.
At present, an initial framework has been laid for Chinas IoT standard system. A number of proposals on standardization submitted by certain organizations to the International Organization for Standardization have been adopted. Initial progress has been achieved in the standardization of IoT. Figure 2.1 is an illustration of the basic framework of IoT standardization.
Basic framework of IoT standardization
The process involved with IoT standardization is highly complex. There ought to be relevant standards for all links, applications, or industries in IoT, and agricultural IoT is no exception. In the process of agricultural IoT standardization, the relevant standards are generally formulated at three levels.
Standardization of the perception layer: the perception layer contains perception control components, perception control gateways, and sensor networks to sense and control the physical world and to convert the information into a prescribed data format and send it to the network layer. The standardization of the perception layer is mainly concerned with common features and technical requirements in terms of interfaces, communications and networks, collaborative information processing, information service support, network security and privacy, consistency, and interoperability testing.
Standardization of the transmission layer: the IoT transmission layer is divided into the wired communication transmission layer and the wireless communication transmission layer. Wired communication technology includes a medium- and long-distance wide-area network and a short-distance fieldbus, while the wireless communication layer is divided into a long-distance wireless local area network, a short-distance wireless local area network, and an ultra-short-distance wireless local area network. Standardization of the transmission layer formulates the information transmission specifications and standard interface protocols under different transmission systems. In particular, it establishes the standardization of information connection under different communication modes to achieve the intercommunication of information in different transmission modes.
Standardization of the application layer: the application layer is engaged in information processing through the cloud computing platform. It can calculate, process and mining the data collected in the perception layer for different applications. The related standardization shares a close correlation with the management process and information processing mode. For example, each subsystem should be provided with standard information interfaces and control interfaces. While achieving the interconnection between things and things, it can also realize things and things control.
In 1983, in Chinas GB 3935.1-83 Basic Terms of Standard Technology, standard was defined as: standards are unified provisions for repetitive things and concepts. They are based on the comprehensive results of science, technology, and practical experience and are agreed upon by the relevant parties, approved by the competent authority, and issued in a specific form as guidelines and basis for mutual compliance.
The essential attribute of the standard is a uniform regulation. This unified provision serves as the common guidelines and basis for all parties concerned.
The scope for setting standards includes repetitive things and concepts. The repetitiveness  mentioned here refers to the nature of the same thing or concept appearing repeatedly. Although the scope of formulating standards has expanded from production and technology to include various fields of economic and social undertakings, standards are not applicable to all things or concepts; rather, they are suited for stable and repetitive things or concepts.
Standard is based on the combination of science, technology, and practical experience. These achievements and experience must be analyzed, compared, integrated, and verified based on standardization. Only in this way can the standards formulated be scientific.
In the process of formulation, standards must obtain the consensus among relevant parties. What this means is that standards should not be decided by minority groups; instead, democracy should be promoted, and consensus should be reached among all parties concerned. For example, the formulation of product standards must involve not only the producers but also consumers and research and inspection departments, so that the standards formulated are authoritative, scientific, and applicable.
The essential characteristic of standards is unanimity. That is, the standard must be approved by the competent authority and issued in a specific form. A set of working procedures and approval systems, from the formulation of standards to their approval and release, is in place.
GB 3935.1 defines standardization as in social undertakings, such as economics, technology, science, and management, repetitive things and concepts are formulated, published, and implemented to achieve uniformity, so that the optimal order and social benefits could be delivered. The meaning of this definition is as follows:
Standardization is an activity. Where there is human activity, the problem of standardization arises. Humans are engaged in activities, in order to obtain the required product or the optimal order. The major components of standardization activities include the exploration of the law of development, the formulation and execution of standards, and the supervision of the implementation of standards.
The process of such activities is a continuously expanding one. For example, in the past, only product standards and technical standards were formulated. Now management standards and work standards must also be formulated. In the past, standardization was mainly a thing in the field of industrial and agricultural production. Now it has been expanded to the area of safety, health, environmental protection, transportation, administrative management, information codes, etc. As human societies move forward, the scope of standardization will continue to expand and deepen.
Standardization is a process of understanding, i.e., the process from practice to knowledge to practice and to the reacquisition of knowledge. As knowledge deepens, improved understanding can be expected. The objective law of the development of things must not be violated. Standardization is to promptly respond according to the degree of understanding and the predictability of the law of development of things. As the understanding of the objective law of things gradually deepens, new questions, new demands, new approaches, and new methods are constantly raised. In the process of understanding, standardization keeps pace with scientific and technological progress and seeks laws, methods, and platforms.
Standard systems are organic wholes composed of a number of standardized documents that are interdependent, interacting, and equipped with specific functions. The internal standards of standard systems should be logically combined according to a certain structure, instead of being piled up in a disorderly manner. Due to the complexity of standardization objects, the logical structure of different standard subsystems in the system may reflect different forms of expression, mainly including two types of hierarchy and linear structure. Standard systems generally consist of block diagrams, developed diagrams, and detailed lists. The block diagram and the developed diagram are standard architecture diagrams, and the detailed list lists the position number, name, standard number (including the standards developed and preferred by the user), maturity, and other information of each standard one by one according to the structure diagram.
The primary role of standardization systems is that it is the framework of standardization. Standard systems indicate what standards are required to achieve the specific goals, the content of such standards, interface, and the interrelationship of these standards. Standard systems optimize the overall structure to avoid the omission and duplication of standards. Moreover, they establish the priority of standards, hence proposing the overall design plan for standardization. Standard systems provide the basis for the planning and arrangement of standardization (Chen and Zhao 2011).
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) and the European Telecommunication Standardization Institute (ETSI) M2M Technical Committee are the typical international standards organizations. According to research undertaken by the International Organization for Standardization, standardization of IoT is mainly divided into three levels (Chen and Zhao 2011), which are related studies on standard systems at the perception layer, transmission layer, and application layer, including IEEE 802.15.1 and other standards.
The perception layer relies on sensors to obtain data and information generated in the physical world. Additionally, it may involve the use of radio-frequency identification (RFID), two-dimensional code, real-time positioning technology, automatic identification and data capture (AIDC), and other technologies. The standardization of the IoT perception layer includes the standardization of sensor information, the standardization of data formats, the standardization of data collection, and the standardization of embedded hardware operating systems.
The standardization system of the IoT perception layer is illustrated in Fig. 2.2. Perceptual standards are refined according to the common characteristics and technical requirements of the IoT perception layer, including technical terms, interfaces, information formats, information descriptions, information identity consistency, and interoperability uniformity and standardization. Doing so makes information universally adaptative and compatible in different systems and increases the accuracy and reliability of information.
IoT information perceptionstandardization system
At the perception layer, the standardization of sensor interfaces, data types, and formats is the core of standardization.
At present, among the existing types of sensors, including digital signal sensors, analog signal sensors, pulse signal sensors, and so on, a number of different sensor interfaces exist, and they are not entirely compatible with each other. Therefore, the standardization process of IoT should investigate and analyze the needs of the applied areas; summarize the sensor system, type, and interface mode; and develop a unified sensor interface standard. The commonly used analog and digital interfaces include 420mA, 05V, SPI, I2C, RS-232, CAN, RS-485, and other signal access sensors. To achieve standardization at the sensor level, different types of sensors must be classified and accessed through different information collection channels of the sensing device, and the standardized information can be relied on to form a unified format.
Multiple types of sensors from different sources are adopted by IoT systems, and sensor data types and formats are diversified as a result. The sharing information is completed through the standards of sensor data exchange, terms and definitions of automatic identification technology, and other standards.
At present, the commonly used data types include audio, video, image, text, etc. The encoding of data and the compressed data formats include MPEG, JPEG, ASN. 1, XML, and so on. The standardization of the perception layer is, at the same time, the standardized classification, identification, and application of the different types of information. By differentiating data types and formats, formulating clear interface definitions and data specifications, avoiding data mismatch in different sensors and application scenarios, and improving the application efficiency of the sensing layer, ISO and IEC have formulated many standards and completed the terms and definitions of sensor automatic identification technology in 2016. There are also a large number of organizations engaged in sensor data exchange, such as TransducerML, SensorML, IRIG, CBRN, EXDL, and TEDS.
Standardized information identification will be the root of IoT standardization. Only when different information are linked through standardized identification can they play major roles in different application systems and generate information value.
The information identifier of the perception layer includes sensor device identifier, information source identifier, information type identifier, device type identifier, information identifier, information type identifier, application type identifier, etc. The standardized identification of such information has passed through some existing standards (such as OID, URI, and so on). In recent years, China has also been pushing its standards to go global. For example, on January 17, 2003, the National Unified Code for Products and Services of China (NPC) standard was officially promulgated. Called GB 18937-2003 National Unified Code for Product and Service Compilation Rules, the standard is positioned as a mandatory national standard.
ISO/IEC 15459 series defines the registration procedure, general rules, single transportation unit, single product and product packaging, single returnable transportation item, and unique identification of groups.
ISO/IEC 15963:2009 describes a numbering system that can be used to identify RFID tags.
ISO/IEC 18000 series provides different definitions of unique frequency range for various RFID technologies; hence, users can select appropriate equipment types according to their needs.
ISO 6346:1995, ISO/TS 10891:2009, ISO 10374:1991, and ISO 18185 series provide definitions for the encoding, communication, and application of RFID electronic seals for freight containers. These methods ensure that RFID tags attached to containers can operate in a variety of environments. These standards are critical to the integration of supply chain information.
ISO 17363:2013, ISO 17364:2013, ISO 17365:2013, ISO 17366:2013, and ISO 17367:2013 standards relate to RFID applications in supply chain management. These standards define the technical aspects and data hierarchies of the information required at each level of the supply chain.
ISO/IEC 29143:2011, ISO/IEC TR 29172:2011, ISO/IEC 29173-1:2012, ISO/IEC 29175:2012, ISO/IEC 29176:2011, ISO/IEC 29178:2012, and ISO/IEC 29179:2012 standards include standards related to mobile AIDC and mobile RFID and can capture data in a flexible manner.
ISO/IEC 29182 series provide a sensor network reference architecture (SNRA), which can help users develop sensor networks.
ISO/IEC 20005:2013, ISO/IEC 30101:2014, ISO/IEC 30128:2014, ISO/IEC/IEEE 21450:2010, and ISO/IEC/IEEE 21451 standard are used to create smart sensor networks.
These standards cover such topics as collaborative information processing, smart grid systems, and smart sensor interfaces. By applying the above standards, users can build more reliable and intelligent sensor networks.
The network layer is mainly responsible for the access of information-aware data communications and the transmission and exchange of network communications. International standards organizations that are focused on the communication network technology include 3GPP and 3GPP2. More specifically, the two study the standardization of M2M service based on the demand of mobile network.
According to the existing standards, the communication and network standards of the basic perception layer platform are divided into four layers: physical layer, MAC layer, network layer, and backbone network access layer.
The physical layer defines the method for raw data transmission between physical devices on the perception layer. According to the different application requirements of the perception layer, the technical methods included in the physical layer slightly differ. The methods generally include the transmission frequency, modulation method, short-range communication strategy, long-range communication strategy, low-rate transmission, and high-rate transmission. Perception layer devices can be interconnected in either wired or wireless means. Many existing wired and wireless communication standards are relatively mature, including RS-232, RS-485, I2C, SPI, HFC, CAN, Ethernet, etc.
Among them, RS-232, RS-485, and CAN are the most commonly used standard communication interfaces in agriculture. Let us take CAN (Controller Area Network) as an example. Developed by the German-based company Bosch, known for the R&D and production of automotive electronic products, CAN is a serial data communication protocol invented to enable the data exchange between modern automotive control and test instruments. Eventually, CAN became an international standard (ISO 11898). In North America and Western Europe, the CAN bus protocol has become the standard bus for automotive computer control systems and embedded industrial control local area networks and is increasingly used in agriculture. For instance, the agricultural temperature monitoring system is based on CAN bus (Gao et al. 2016).
The MAC layer ensures the logical connection between the devices in the sensing layer and realizes the communication between devices through addressing and channel access control. In order to make up for the unreliability of data transmission in the physical layer, the MAC layer also provides such services as flow control, error detection, and error control, thus ensuring the reliable transmission of data between devices.
Compared with other network entities, the perception layer of IoT is limited by energy, communication, storage, and computing capabilities, which is why the standard of the MAC layer must allow higher energy efficiency and less data interaction. Some existing MAC layer protocols do not take these restrictions into consideration; thus, they cannot be effectively applied to the IoT perception layer. Depending on research on the scalability of existing MAC layer protocols (such as CSMA/Ca, dynamic DMA, and S-MAC), device sleep strategy, channel access control technology, flow and error control technology, multiplexing technology, and the applicability of existing MAC layer technology in the IoT can be improved.
The network layer , located above the physical layer and MAC layer in the IoT communication, is equipped with the functions of flow control, tolerance control, relay routing, and route selection of the whole network. In the process of network layer standardization, the key standardization technology still lies in the transmission protocol, resolution algorithms, and automatic identification and mapping of address.
IoT is characterized by the continuous generalization of things and things connected networks, that is, small communication LANs are continuously connected with the external LANs, eventually giving birth to something that is based on the Internet, yet transcends the scope of the Internet. The key is to connect small LAN to WAN. At this time, the communication layer needs to access the communication backbone to realize its application. Here, the key to access is to standardize the protocol of access layer. By defining the sending and receiving of gateway, the application program interface, and the data communication format through standardized protocol, the interconnection of standardized backbone network is realized, which plays a decisive role in the realization of various applications in the perception layer of IoT. Depending on wired or wireless means of transmission, the transmission layer standards are divided into wired communication standards and wireless communication standards.
Wired communication standards include Ethernet, ATM, Frame Relay, SDH, FDDI, Fibre Channel, ISDN, VPN, VoIP, Cable/xDSL, BACNet, CAN bus, ControlNet, DeviceNet, Dupline, FF, HART, INTERBUS, LonWorks, Modbus, PROFIBUS, SWIFTNet, Vnet/IP, WorldFIP, CC-Link Industrial Ethernet, RS-232, RS-485, and other different bus technologies.
Wireless communication standards include 2G (GSM, CDMA), 2.5G (EDGE, HSCSD), 3G (WCDMA, EV-DO, HSUPA, EV-DOrA), 4G (EV-DOrB, LTE, WiMAX, UMB, UWB), Bluetooth, HiperLAN, 6LoWPAN, HomeRF, Insteon, IrDA, IRIG, NFC, RFID, WAVE, Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Z-Wave, and other wireless communication technologies.
Compared with wired transmission, the restrictions on energy consumption, communication, storage, and computing power in wireless transmission network are far more inferior. Therefore, wireless transmission network poses greater challenges to the network layer standard, requiring automatic configuration of network information, automatic address resolution between network addresses and physical addresses, and automatic data unit transmission and protocol decoding between points.
IEC 61158 series and IEC 61784 series, used for real-time distributed control, are the standard for fieldbus configuration and configuration files, including basic fieldbus, involving PROFIBUS and PROFINET, P-Net, WorldFIP, INTERBUS, SWIFTNet, CC-Link, HART, VNET/IP, TCnet, EtherCAT, Ethernet Powerlink, Factory Automation Ethernet (EPA), Modbus, SERCOS, RAPIEnet, SafetyNet, and MECHATROLINK.
IEC 62591:2016 (WirelessHARTTM) and IEC 62601:2015 (WIA-PA), industrial wireless communication standards for process automation, are suitable for industrial measurement and monitoring of wireless network systems. WirelessHARTTM is a standard designed for process measurement and control applications to manage real-time operations. Both of the above standards are used for industrial wireless transmission, while the ISO/IEC 14476 series is used to enhance communication transmission protocols and ensure the quality of service (QoS).
ISO/IEC 29180:2012 is used to ensure the security of ubiquitous sensor networks.
ISO/IEC 27033 series are used to ensure network and information security and minimize the risk of information security crisis.
IEC 62443 series are relied on to ensure the safety of industrial automation and control system and to provide comprehensive safety protection.
ISO/IEC8802 series are international standards that relate to the transmission layer, and its applicable scope includes local area networks (LAN) and metropolitan area networks (MAN). LAN is used for micro-wired or wireless transmission in small workplaces, homes, and offices, whereas MAN is connected to many LANs, and both standards are micro-communications.
At present, international standards organizations that are focused on the communication network technology include 3GPP and 3GPP2. More specifically, the two study the standardization of M2M service based on the demand of mobile network. Among the international standards organizations that have carried out systematic research on the general framework of ubiquitous networks, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) and the European Telecommunication Standardization Institute (ETSI) M2M Technical Committee are the typical international standards organizations. In particular, ITU-T studies the overall architecture from the perspective of ubiquitous network, while ETSI studies the overall architecture from the perspective of M2M (Lang et al. 2019; Yang et al. 2013).
Using the collected data, the application layer forms a dynamic data resource database, which meets IoT-related business needs. IoT-related businesses include those engaged in retail, health, energy, mobility, city, manufacturing, publishing, and services. A large number of standards organizations have formulated application level standards for specific applications, mainly involving application technologies. Different from the standard system in the field of traditional computer and communication that does not involve specific application standards, IoT is dominated by application. In the application layer of IoT, there are quite a number of standards in the fields of intelligent measurement, e-health, urban automation, automobile application, consumer electronics application, and so on.
Application layer standards can be divided into data standards and software framework standards . Specifically, data standards include Object Name Service (ONS)/Physical Markup Language (PML), Next-Generation Telematics Protocol (NGTP), Electronic Device Description Language (EDDL), FDT/DTM, OPC, M2MXML, BITXml, and Open Building Information Xchange (oBIX). Software frameworks include, for instance, DRM, IDM, MDM, SOA, OSGi, and software as Service (SaaS), ArchestrA, and Sedona.
Below are some of the examples of IEC international standards related to the IoT application.
IEC 62453 (FDT): used for the standardization of communication and configuration interfaces between field devices and host systems. The device can be configured, operated, and maintained through the user interface.
IEC 61804-3, IEC 61804-4, IEC 61804-5, and IEC 61804-6 (EDDL): used for the description of the digital communication characteristics of intelligent field instruments and equipment parameters. EDDL technology, a communication protocol, enables host system manufacturers to create a single engineering environment that can support multiple devices from any vendor.
According to the definition of IoT mentioned above and the definitions of standards, standardization, and standard systems, we could determine the definition of agricultural IoT standards  the standards of agricultural IoT are the standards and basis for summarizing the scientific and technological achievements of IoT technology in the specific application of agricultural production, operation, management, and service and are approved by the relevant department of agricultural standards or the relevant professional committee. Moreover, the standards of agricultural IoT are issued in the prescribed form, recognized in the relevant fields, and followed jointly by the relevant parties.
Recent years witnessed remarkable progresses in the construction of agricultural IoT. Gradually, countries and regions around the globe have started with the application and demonstration programs of agricultural IoT. These projects explored extensively for the research of key technologies of agricultural IoT and for the establishment of the standard system. However, as the construction of agricultural IoT accelerates, a number of problems have arisen, thus limiting its further development. For example, due to the lack of a unified and standardized concept for agricultural sensor standards, the interface functions of agricultural sensors produced by different manufacturers significantly differ, and it is difficult to integrate them into an agricultural IoT application system. Furthermore, owing to the lack of perception data storage and standardized description of application, it is difficult to share data between different IoT application systems, and because of the lack of standards for IoT in agricultural production, including crop farming, facility horticulture, livestock farming, and aquaculture, IoT systems established in different units and regions are not compatible, and data and equipment information are not universal (Shen and Yang 2015).
These problems reflect the weak links in agricultural IoT standardization. The lack of relevant standards makes it difficult to integrate the sensing layer devices of agricultural IoT. By the same token, the information transmitted by the transmission layer is difficult to adapt to networks with different topologies. The diverse types of services and methods provided by the application layer make the construction of agricultural IoT quite challenging, and costs cannot be effectively controlled. Therefore, in order to promote the rapid, unified, and standardized development of agricultural IoT, it is necessary to strengthen the construction of agricultural IoT standards. By building an IoT system for agricultural applications, such as field agriculture, facility agriculture, orchard agriculture, and aquaculture, different sensing devices can be integrated with applications, different sensing transmission network architectures can be seamlessly connected, and different sensing services can be coordinated and unified to ensure the healthy, orderly, rapid, and scientific development of agricultural IoT (Lee 2008).
As the basis for standardizing the application system of agricultural IoT, the standards of agricultural IoT are also fundamental to realizing the sharing of perceived data and services of agriculture. Therefore, agricultural IoT standard systems play an extremely important role in pursuing related technologies of agricultural IoT.
The standardization of agricultural IoT is a process of formulating, issuing, and implementing the standards of agricultural IoT for achieving unity. The standard system of agricultural IoT is an organic whole composed of several standards documents that are interactive and interdependent, and they also feature specific functions. There are two standard systems of agricultural IoT, namely, basic general standard and industrial application standard. Standardization constitutes the basis for the integration of key technologies of agricultural IoT, the premise for standardizing the R&D and production of relevant equipment, and the foundation for standardizing the application system. It is the key to the sharing of agricultural data and services, especially to the interconnection of different systems, and the use of applications.
The content of standard systems of agricultural IoT can be divided into two categories: the basic general standard of agricultural IoT and the standard of industrial IoT. The basic general standards of the agricultural IoT include the general standards of agricultural IoT, the perception level standard system, the network level standard system, the application level standard system, and the common key technology standard system. The standard system of IoT in agriculture covers such aspects as crop farming, aquaculture, and livestock farming. Figure 2.3 offers an illustration of the specific structure of the system (Gao 2017).
Standard system of agricultural IoT
The standard system of the agricultural IoT is relatively complex. In fact, the system can be constructed from six levels  the overall level, the perception level, the network level, the processing level, the application level, and the common key technology standard system. The standard system of agricultural IoT covers architecture standards, application requirements standards, communication protocols, identification standards, security standards, application standards, data standards, information processing standards, and public service platform standards, each of which may also involve technical standards, protocol standards, interface standards, equipment standards, test standards, interworking standards, etc. (Zhang and Zhang 2019).
The application system of agricultural IoT includes rich contents. Generally speaking, it includes the IoT management of crop farming, livestock farming, and aquaculture. Among them, crop farming is divided into two kinds: field agricultural IoT and facility agricultural IoT. In actual practice, there will be more branches of application, and the subsystems may also have their own industry-specific and region-specific characteristics. For example, in the application of IoT in crop farming, the measures adopted for different growth stages are completely different, the IoT application system in seedling raising process, the IoT system in field growth process, etc. Moreover, crop farming in different regions and varieties significantly differ. Therefore, the standardization of agricultural IoT application system mainly features standardized application models from the macro perspective (refer to Fig. 2.4 for the standardized water product networking system in crop farming).
Standardization structure of IoT system in aquaculture
In the aquatic product networking, water environment information is mainly obtained through various water quality sensors, and the water environment is thoroughly adjusted in combination with aquaculture technology to create the optimal environment for aquaculture, thereby making the industry efficient and safe. However, the application of IoT standards in the breeding process of each species or at different stages still demands extensive research. Similarly, in livestock farming, the perception system includes not only sensor data but also sound, image, and video information, as shown in Fig. 2.5.
Application of IoT standardization system in livestock and poultry breeding
The standardization of agricultural IoT system has yielded fruitful results in the basic technology layer, but the progress in the application layer remains slow. In general, the technical standards for agricultural IoT are steadily moving forward. The following are some of the more prominent progresses delivered so far.
The standards of agricultural IoT and those of IoT in general are consistent.
IoT is based on the extensive application of object coding technology and sensor technology. Its core technology is still information perception and coding identification and automatic identification and network technology. Therefore, in building the standardization system of agricultural IoT, one should attach greater importance to the standardization of information perception, such as information identification, information definition, and information format.
The major contents of the standardization of agricultural IoT include the function, performance, and interface standards of agricultural sensors and identification equipment, data transmission and communication protocol standards, agricultural multi-source data fusion analysis and processing standards, application service standards, construction specifications of agricultural IoT projects, etc.
This chapter elucidates the concepts of standards, standardization, and standard system and summarizes the concept of the standardization system of the agricultural IoT. Finally, it lays out a brief introduction of the existing standards and standard construction specifications involved in the application of the sensing layer, transmission layer, and application layer of agricultural IoT, including crop farming, facility gardening, livestock farming, aquaculture, and agricultural products logistics. After reading the chapter, readers are expected to build an overall understanding of the standardization system of agricultural IoT.

Ordinary objects that we use in our daily life have become now connected to the Internet and are getting even smarter. Wearable devices, thermostats, cars, door locks, lights, and more appliances are now connected over the Internet of Things. Therefore, the number of these smart things increases remarkably. At the present time, we talk about billions of connected devices and it is expected that this rapid growth will carry forward in an exponential way. This development has led to the investment in IoT applications that allow users interacting with all their devices, monitoring and controlling them remotely. Furthermore, the massive amount of data generated by connected devices and sensors should be transformed into actionable insights and predictions thanks to Big Data technologies for better user experience automation. In the interest of developing and implementing IoT applications, many Internet of Things frameworks and platforms are now designed. This paper provides a review of several available IoT frameworks and platforms. For each one of them, we discuss its architecture and its important features. Moreover, these frameworks are compared to each other depending on several criteria, such as: Security, data analytics, and support of visualization.

Nowadays, Internet of Things is one of the fastest growing industries in the world. It is more and more affecting our daily life and developed and deployed almost in every field. The main application domains of IoT are: industry [1], healthcare [2], smart cities, e-commerce, environment [3], military [4] and energy [5]. Hence, this new connected world in full emergence forces companies to prepare and exploit new opportunities, and imagine new business models around the data generated by smart devices. This will allow to exploit these data in order to make the users life easier.
We can define the Internet of Things (IoT) as a giant network, in which physical devices (things) are inter-connected and they can be controlled or monitored remotely. These devices are connected to the Internet, and they have the ability to interact with each other without human intervention. Therefore, they are considered to be smart and not only simple objects. There are various types of IoT devices (wearable devices, smart thermostats, IP cameras, robots, health monitoring devices etc.), and most of them are embedded with sensors, thus they can automatically detect events or changes in the surrounding environment, and transmit these data over network protocols. Big amount of data is collected from different IoT connected devices, then forwarded to servers (cloud) for analysis purpose, and finally results are shared with other devices in order to improve users experience.
Actually, there are multiple frameworks and platforms in the IoT market, which make easy the development and the deployment of IoT applications. However, it is a real challenge for developers to make the best choice of a framework, and this depends on their own visions.
Few studies have been covering IoT frameworks and platforms topic. Derhamy et al. [6] give a comparative analysis of several commercial IoT frameworks, based on the architecture approach, organizations support, supported communication protocols, hardware requirement, interoperability, security, governance, and support for rapid application development. Ammar et al. [7] give a review of several IoT frameworks, which includes the architecture, the specifications of smart applications and hardware, and the security features of each framework.
In this paper we present a survey of five well-known IoT frameworks, such as: AWS IoT, Azure IoT Suite, Iotivity, SmartThings, and Eclipse Kura, and we focus on Big Data and security features of each one of them.
This paper is structured as follow: In Sect.2 we present the general IoT architecture. Then we discuss in Sect.3 the relation between Big Data and IoT with the focus on Big Data processes that are employed in the IoT domain. Thereafter we present in Sect.4 an overview of several available IoT frameworks and platforms. For each one we discuss its architecture and its important features. Section5 gives a comparative analysis of theses frameworks depending on multiple criteria, such as: The framework type, pricing model, messaging protocols, support of virtual devices, data storage, data cleaning, data analytics, real-time data analytics, Machine Learning, data visualization and security features. Finally, we conclude the paper with Sect.6.
There is no standard architecture for Internet of Things yet, but many researchers commonly present this architecture as three basic layers: Perception/Physical layer, Network layer and Application layer as shown in Fig.1.
IoT three-layer architecture
It includes the hardware used in the IoT ecosystem (sensors and actuators). In this layer we can find several technologies such as Wireless sensor network (WSN), Radio-frequency identification (RFID) and Near-field communication (NFC). The major requirements for this layer are the support of the heterogeneity of IoT devices and the energy efficiency, thus sensors should be operational for gathering and transmitting data in real-time [8].
The second layer is responsible to ensure the communication of IoT devices with each other, in the case of Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for example, or in some other cases, the communication directly with the cloud via a gateway. Data are collected by the perception layer and transmitted for analysis and decision-making purpose by several communication protocols, such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), IEEE 802.15.4 standard and ZigBee in the case of low-power and low-bandwidth needs, also WIFI, 4G and 5G are used in this layer.
The third layer is the software part of the IoT architecture. It is responsible of presenting data after being collected and analyzed for a specific IoT application domain (e.g., healthcare, transportation, smart grid etc.). It is considered as the front end of the IoT architecture [9]. Several protocols are deployed in this layer, such as Constrained application protocol (CoAP), Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) etc.
Nowadays, the number of connected devices increases exponentially. Thus, the amount of generated data from different sources in the smart environment is massive, hence the use of Big Data technologies in the IoT ecosystem is absolutely necessary. They are used to carry out a set of processes on generated data for applying actions on IoT devices, especially predictions, which will finally improve users daily life.
Big Data classification according to its 5Vs model is suitable for the IoT case, because the size of generated data is immense (volume), and these data are coming from different sources with different types (variety), collected in real time (velocity), not certain (veracity) and worthy (value).
Four aspects of Big Data processes are the most used in the IoT domain such as: Storage, Data cleaning/cleansing, Analysis/Analytics and Visualization [10].
Storage: Cloud storage is widely used in this Big Data feature, with favoring NoSQL Databases instead of Relational Databases.
Data cleaning: This is an important phase that comes before analysis, in which the quality of data is verified and improved [11].
Analysis: Clustering is the most used algorithm for data analysis in the IoT domain. In this phase various types of data are examined in order to extract valuable conclusions from it, which present a lot of benefits in every IoT application domain (e.g., minimizing traffic congestion, predicting future electricity needs, predicting epidemics, understand costumer needs etc.) [12].
Visualization: In this phase, data is presented and interpreted using different methods after being analyzed.
IoT frameworks helps developers for implementing and deploying IoT-based applications in the shortest time possible. It provides a collection of guiding rules, protocols and standards. For this survey we have chosen five frameworks to review.
Amazon Web Service IoT is a platform which allows connected devices to communicate securely with each other and with the cloud. It offers several services like AWS IoT Analytics, which is capable of analyzing petabytes of generated data [13].
AWS IoT architecture has four principal components: Device Gateway, Rules Engine, Device Shadows and Registry [14]. The Device Gateway enables devices to interact with the cloud and with each other over MQTT protocol, with supporting the publish/subscribe programming model. The Rules Engine manages data delivery from publisher to subscriber devices depending on rules. The Device Shadow stores the last state of each device before being offline. It allows applications to interact with devices even when they are not online. The last component of AWS IoT architecture is the Registry. It is responsible of identifying connected devices by giving them a unique Id number.
Regarding the security of AWS IoT framework, the Message Broker gives each connected device mutual authentication, using different techniques, mainly the X.509 certificates. Also, authorization and access control process are guaranteed by the Rules Engine. Moreover, developers can create their own rules, using the AWS Management Console Service. Finally, all data traffic is encrypted over the Transport Layer Security (TLS).
Iotivity framework is an open source project, intended to Smart Home field. It facilitates Device-to-Device communication by using CoAP as messaging protocols, and provides a CoAP-HTTP proxy for allowing CoAP clients to interact with resources from HTTP servers [15]. Furthermore, it supports the publish/subscribe programming model [16].
Iotivity architecture is composed of the Base Layer, the Service Layer and the Cloud Interface [17]. The Base Layer includes an important feature (Discovery), which allow a device to find other nearby devices. Security is also implemented in this layer (authentication, securing data flow by using DTLS/TLS protocols and an access control policy, ensured by the Security Resource Manager), the last component of the Base Layer is Messaging. It allows the connectivity of IoT devices. Among the Service Layer functionalities there is an important one called simulator, which allows developers or users testing a set of devices before buying them.
It is an IoT cloud-based platform, released by Microsoft. It allows users to connect hundreds of heterogeneous devices with the cloud. It provides many functionalities, such as: The possibility of testing a set of virtual devices before buying them, Machine Learning and real-time data analytics by Azure Stream Analytics; this service allows developers to write their stream processing logic using SQL like language, with an embedded support for temporal logic, also to build real-time dashboards [18].
The backbone of Azure IoT Suite architecture is the Azure IoT Hub. It is the gateway between the cloud and the connected devices, and it allows them to communicate over multiple protocols, such as: HTTP, AMPQ or MQTT. It supports also other protocols that are adapted by the Azure IoT Protocol Gateway. In the Azure IoT Suite architecture there are two categories of devices: IP capable devices, that are linked directly to the Azure IoT Hub, because of implementing one of the three supported protocols, and PAN (Personal Area Network) devices, that are connected to the Azure IoT hub via the Field Gateway, since they are constrained. In the cloud side of the architecture we find two layers: IoT Solution Backend, which provide multiple cloud services and Presentation and Business Connectivity, which is responsible of data visualization.
As for the security of this framework, it is applied at three levels: The device, the connection and the cloud [19]. Two methods are used for the authentication of devices to the Azure IoT Hub: The first one is a security token method, based on a symmetric key, and the second one depends on X.509 certificates and a private key. For securing the data flow, TLS protocol is used to encrypt all communications. Lastly, access control policies for each security key are implemented at the Azure IoT Hub level.
It is an IoT platform released by Samsung. It is designed for Smart Home applications, and supports most of home automation devices. It allows users to connect, control and monitor their smart devices via a single mobile application. For developing and implementing SmartThings applications, Groovy is used as programming language [20].
SmartThing Hub is the backbone of the platforms architecture [21]. It is the intermediary between the smart devices and the cloud services that are accessible via a mobile application. It is compatible with multiple standards, such as: LAN, ZigBee and Z-Wave. SmartThings Cloud Backend provides several functionalities, such as: Connectivity Management, SmartApp Management and Execution, Web UI and IDE.
Security features of SmartThings framework are the following: OAuth/OAuth2 protocol is used for the authentication of smart devices. For access control, SmartThings Capability Model is provided for limiting smart applications assessing all devices capabilities. Moreover, Kohsuke sandbox technique is applied for denying untrusted Groovy scripts. Lastly SSL/TLS protocol is provided for encrypting communications [7].
It is an open source IoT framework based on Java/OSGI. It is dedicated for building IoT gateways that contain Machine-to-Machine (M2M) applications. It offers a wide range of APIs for developers, with an abstraction and isolation from the complexity of the hardware. Furthermore, this framework supports only Linux-based devices.
The components of Eclipse Kura architecture are the following: Firstly, the Device Abstraction, which gives developers the access for many devices by OSGI services, with abstracting the hardware. Then Basic Gateway Services, which includes multiple services (watchdog, clock, embedded database etc.). Also, Network Configuration, which allows the configuration of interfaces available in the gateway (Ethernet, Wi-Fi or Cellular). Connectivity and Delivery, used to make easy the development of applications that are connected with a remote cloud over MQTT protocol. Remote Management, responsible of the deployment, upgrade, configuration and management of the IoT applications. Application, which offers a data flow programming tool for data storage and aggregation. Finally, Administration GUI, which is a web interface dedicated for managing the gateway [22].
Concerning the security of this framework, ESF is an open source tool added to Kura framework in order to enforce its security; it provides runtime policies for limiting the execution of some services. Moreover, SSL protocol is implemented for encrypting all communication and for a mutual authentication of IoT devices, using a couple of certificates (public and private key) [23].
The following table gives a comparison of the five underlying IoT frameworks and platforms (Table1).
We can classify the five underlying frameworks in two categories: open source frameworks (Iotivity, SmartThings and Eclipse Kura) and paid solutions (AWS IoT and Azure IoT Suite).
The two latter frameworks offer a wide range of services; all Big Data features are included (Data storing, Real-time data analysis, data cleaning, data visualization using dashboards), with the support of Machine Learning and the storage of a big amount of data in No SQL databases. Also, all security measures are applied at different layers of their architecture. Furthermore, they all support MQTT which is a lightweight protocol in terms of small code footprint and low bandwidth requirement. However, these two frameworks need costs for each used service.
Concerning the open source frameworks, they provide several features for building IoT applications easily: All the three underlying frameworks implement different security features either for devices authentication (with OAuth or SSL protocol) or for access control policies, or for data flow encryption. They also support CoAP, which is an important protocol of IoT, designed for constrained devices, in addition of MQTT protocol (Eclipse Kura case). There is a lack in terms of some Big Data features, such as data analysis and data visualization. Otherwise, it is possible to combine these frameworks with other stream analytics frameworks and cloud platforms.
The development of Internet of Things world has led to the creation of sophisticated IoT applications which include all users requirements such as: Security, privacy, data analytics for the extraction of important insights from data etc. This is the role of IoT frameworks and platforms which provides a set of guiding rules and ready-to-use features that accelerate the process of developing and deploying IoT applications.
In this survey, we have brought into focus the key features of five different IoT frameworks and platforms from open source and paid solutions. Then we have presented a comparative analysis of theses frameworks depending on multiple criteria, with focusing on the use of Big Data features and the security of each one of them, because of their necessity in IoT applications. Therefore, this study can give developers a clear vision of which framework is the most suitable for their future projects.

2024-05-24 16:31:51,748 - root - INFO - Content: Agriculture is a major consumer of freshwater, in particular in countries like India. From the perspectives of crop yield and water conservation, the development of advanced model-based irrigation scheduling methods is desirable. Most of the farming in India is done by small-scale farmers and to serve their needs, we are developing a simple model-based system that can be applied semi-manually and does not need expensive sensors and costly data. In this article, an optimal irrigation system, based on Model Predictive Control (MPC), which uses a physics-based model to compute an optimal amount of irrigation for the next day, is developed. The robustness of the developed system is tested by comparing the effect of errors in a key model parameter as well as in the weather forecast.

Automated decision-making gains traction, prompting discussions on regulation with calls for human oversight. Understanding how human involvement affects the acceptance of algorithmic recommendations and the accuracy of resulting decisions is vital. In an online experiment (N = 292), for a prediction task, participants choose a recommendation stemming either from an algorithm or another participant. In a between-subject design, we varied if the prediction was delegated completely or if the recommendation could be adjusted. 66% of times, participants preferred to delegate the decision to an algorithm over an equally accurate human. The preference for an algorithm increased by 7 percentage points if participants could monitor and adjust the recommendations. Participants followed algorithmic recommendations more closely. Importantly, they were less likely to intervene with the least accurate recommendations. Hence, in our experiment the human-in-the-loop design increases the uptake but decreases the accuracy of the decisions.

Today, algorithms are increasingly used to make decisions of economic and legal importance. Automated decision supports are already used by companies and public institutions for a variety of tasksfrom evaluating job applications, to deciding what salary or bonus to offer or even to bail and parole decisions [14]. The increased use of such (partially) automated decisions may have significant legal and economic effects and has been accompanied by calls for policies that put a human in the loop (e.g., Art. 22 of the EUs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [5] or Art. 14 of the EUs draft AI Act [6]). These policies envision a system where a human monitors and interacts with an automated decision support system by both relying on the inputs provided by the system, but also consistently and thoughtfully analyzing them. From a legal perspective, a human monitor is introduced to exercise oversight over the decision-making process to maintain human agency and accountability, provide legal safeguards, or perform quality control [7].
Behavioral research raises concerns about the seamless functioning of such hybrid decision systems and emphasizes that human behavior in them might be systematically different. However, there is a need for further understanding of the exact patterns of the differences [8]. When deciding whether to use the automated decision support system, people were found both averse to using algorithms in decision-making [see algorithm aversion in 9, 10, for an overview] and appreciative of them [see algorithm appreciation in 11, 12]. When engaging with the algorithmic recommendations, users relied on the automated support too little by not incorporating the recommendations into their decisions [11, 13]and too much by failing to appropriately correct their mistakes [automation bias and automation-induced complacency, see [14, 15], for an overview]. Against the backdrop of the importance of legal and policy discussion, the existing evidence provides little guidance for the role of human agency in interaction with automated decision supports.
In this paper, we consider two research questions: First, we study if moving from a fully automated decision-making system to a human-in-the-loop system increases the preference for using an algorithmic decision support (over a human one). As conjectured in [8], one possible explanation for seemingly inconsistent and conflicting findings is the allocation of decision-making authority between humans and machines in an automated decision-making situation. In this case, introducing a Human-in-the-Loop system can increase the uptake of the automated decision supports. Second, we study if keeping a human in the loop results in effective monitoring of algorithmic decisions. We consider how human monitors engage with recommendations from different sources and if their adjustments improve the accuracy of the decisions. If the monitoring human blindly rubberstamps the recommendations of the system and follows them as default decisions [16], the human-in-the-loop might not play the role that policy makers hope for.
Answering these questions is of high applied importance to organizations introducing automated decision-making supports into their work processes or developing them as well as to policy-makers who aim to introduce regulatory safeguards. An important example of such regulatory safeguards that apply to automated decision-making is Art. 22 of the EU GDPR. It prohibits fully delegating a decision to automated means if it produces legal effects on a human decision subject or similarly impacts that individual. The effectiveness of this article is disputed by some commentators, see e.g. [17] or conversely [18]). The draft of the EUs AI Act further develops the idea that automated decision systems require human oversight. In Art. 14 a specific obligation to human oversight in the development of high-risk AI systems is proposed. The AI act will be the first law on AI by a major regulator and is likely to have a global impact both due to Brussels effectorganizations voluntary applying higher standards required by the EU regulation outside of the EU [19]and setting a legislative precedent for comprehensive AI-specific regulation in other countries [20]. The widely signed Montral Declaration of Artificial Intelligence [21] also states that [i]n all areas where a decision that affects a persons life, quality of life, or reputation must be made, where time and circumstance permit, the final decision must be taken by a human being and that decision should be free and informed (principle 9.1).
To provide empirical evidence to answer these questions we conduct an online experiment with a prediction task: Participants are asked to predict the performance of a student in a standardized math test based on the students profile [as previously used in [22]. To assist the performance prediction, participants are offered an estimate from one of two sources: either from another human participant (generated in a pre-experimental session) or from a statistical model. Participants are informed that both the estimates of the other participants and the model are of equal quality on average. Using a between subject design, we vary if participants delegate the prediction fully to the provider of the estimate (Delegation condition) or whether they can adjust it before submitting the performance prediction (Human-in-the-Loop condition). In the following, for the sake of brevity we refer to the estimates participants receive from either a human or an algorithm as recommendation in both the Delegation and Human-in-the-Loop conditions, although in the Delegation condition participants cannot adjust the recommendation.
We find both a general preference for automated decision support, and that this preference increases further when the human principal is allowed to retain some agency over the decision. Indeed, even in the Delegation condition, participants chose to delegate the decision to an algorithm rather than to another human in 66% of cases. As human and algorithmic recommendations were curated to be equally accurate and participants were informed about it, this finding speaks for a preference for an algorithm. This result is in line with several recent papers [e.g., 23, 24] that also do not find algorithm aversion even under full delegation. Allowing participants to adjust the recommendation further significantly increases the likelihood to opt for a recommendation by an algorithm by 11% (7 percentage points). Hence, we find evidence that the retention of human oversight can significantly increase the willingness to use automated decision-making support. In the Human-in-the-Loop condition participants also report feeling more confident in the predictions they submitted regardless of the source of the recommendation.
When investigating how participants engage with the recommendations, we find evidence of automation bias (i.e., of over-reliance on the automated inputs): Participants tend to follow recommendations produced by algorithms more closely than those by humans (although they are almost always identical). In our experimental environment, we also find that the participants adjustments decrease the accuracy of the final predictions: Within the Human-in-the-Loop condition, participants appear to particularly struggle to appropriately adjust the recommendations that stem from an algorithm. Predictions submitted following the algorithmic recommendation appear to be (insignificantly) less accurate. Probably most problematically from the perspective of decision quality, the human monitors are less likely to adjust recommendations that contain larger errors as compared to smaller ones regardless of the source. Moreover, the adjustments made to recommendations with larger errors also tend to be smaller. All of these findings raise questions on the effectiveness of policies that propose the retention of a human in the loop to ensure the quality of the decision-making. The vivid discussions around such policies however point to a wish to retain such human oversight. Indeed, as a final result of our experiment (and similar to the general population [25, 26]), the vast majority of participants believe that a human should almost always be put in place to monitor algorithmic decisions.
In summary, the findings of our experiment hence highlight an important trade-off: while the retention of human oversight can increase the uptake of automated decision-making support, it may also decrease the quality of the final decisions. Our experiment demonstrates this in a stylized version of a task where automated recommendations are already widely used, namely admission processes for university or higher schooling placements [e.g., 27]. In the wide range of possible applications of automated recommendations, this trade-off may be resolved differently for each context-specific application. However, the awareness of it may prove useful when considering the legislative framework surrounding automated decision-making; as we will discuss further on.
Our online experiment (see Fig 1 for an overview) adopts the task first used in [22], which requires participants to forecast the percentile ranks of U.S. high school students at a nationwide standardized math test based on a short student profile. The profile contains nine characteristics of a student (see S7 and S8 Figs in S1 File): the students race, their familys socio-economic status (in quintiles), their desired occupation at age 30, their self-predicted highest educational degree, the region of the USA they live in, the number of times they took the PSAT, the number of the students friends who are not going to college, their favorite subject, and whether the student has taken any AP test. Participants in the study, which took place in Switzerland, where provided with additional explanatory information about all of these items. The task uses real, public data from the U.S. High School Longitudinal Study of 2009.

To make their test performance prediction, participants are offered estimates from one of the two sources: either from another human participant or from a statistical model. In the further text we use the terms statistical model and algorithm interchangeably. The human estimates were drawn from data generated in a pre-study with US-based participants on Amazon MTurk. The estimates of an algorithm come from a model developed in [22]. When introduced to the task, participants are provided with some basic information about the statistical model and the other participant. The description of both sources was purposefully written to be similar. In particular, participants were informed that both the model and another participants were imperfect, and that both make average mistakes of 15 to 20 percentiles. In more details, participants were informed that the statistical model was designed to forecast the percentile score of a student in the math test, that for its estimations it uses only the information in the displayed profiles and that it is developed in the US by thoughtful analysts. They were also informed that the models estimates are off by 15 to 20 percentiles on average. About the other participants they learned that the predictions were made during a pre-study with participants located in the US who also used the information in displayed profiles. They were also informed that the other participants estimates are off by 15 to 20 percentiles on average. S9 Fig in S1 File displays a snippet of experimental instructions. In the experiment, the recommendations of the algorithm or the other participant were curated to differ at most by 2 percentiles, yet participants were only informed about the identical average performance.
Participants could choose if they want to receive the recommendation from an algorithm or another humanrather than choosing between an algorithms recommendation and unassisted decision. With this design choice, we deviate from the design of [22] and follow another seminal paper in the field [11]. By looking at the choice between two sources of recommendations we are able to take into account that people generally discount advice relative to their own judgment [28, 29]. Put differently, we aim to investigate the participants willingness to use automated rather than human advice without the impact of (potential) over-confidence in their own capabilities.
We conducted two treatments in a between subject design. In the Delegation condition, participants fully delegated the decision to the chosen source of a recommendation. That is, the participants could choose between receiving the recommendation from either another participant or an algorithm and this recommendation was then directly recorded as the participants prediction of the students performance. In the Human-in-the-Loop condition, participants also chose if they want to receive a recommendation from an algorithm or a human but could then either submit this recommendation as is or adjust it. If they chose to adjust the recommendation, they were able to do so without any restrictions (see Fig 1 and S7, S8 Figs in S1 File for example screens).
Participants were asked to make predictions for 20 profiles, which were split into four blocks of five profiles. Before the start of each block, participants were asked to choose if they prefer to receive the recommendations from another participant or from the algorithm. Each participant hence made four choices regarding their preferred source of recommendations. The sequence of profiles was constant for all participants. Importantly, in our experiment we do not provide feedback on the accuracy of the performance predictions during the experiment. This design choice is motivated by the fact that for many applications of algorithmic decision supports, information on the correctness of the prediction is not immediately available.
It is conceivable that participants who select a certain type of the recommendation source might be better able to engage with the recommendations by this type of a source. To explore if selection of the recommendation source affects how its recommendations are used, in the Human-in-the-Loop condition, 40% of times participants were assigned to the source of recommendations different to the one they desired. For instance, if a participant in the Human-in-the-Loop condition chose to receive the recommendations by the algorithm, she would receive the algorithms recommendations with p = 0.6 and be given the other participants recommendations with p = 0.4. Participants were informed about this in the beginning of the experiment. They were clearly informed about the source of the estimate, both with an intermittent screen after the choice of the source and consistently on their screens. Due to this feature, we opted for an unequal number of participants per treatment. 292 participants took part in the experiment in total. Upon starting the experiment, participants were assigned to Delegation condition with 40% change, and to Human-in-the-Loop with 60% chance. Therefore, 108 were randomly assigned to the Delegation condition and 184 to the Human-in-the-Loop condition.
Participants were invited using the UAST subject pool jointly used by the University of Zurich and ETH Zurich. The only exclusion criteria was a good command of English and a minimum age of 18. Most of the participants were students at ETH Zurich (54%). The average age was 24 years old. 53% of participants were female. 62% were students in a STEM discipline.
The main experiment was implemented and conducted by the ETH Zurich Decision Science Laboratory (ETH DeSciL) using oTree [30]. Participants received a show-up fee of 5 CHF and were additionally incentivized to make accurate predictions of the high school students performance according to the following system: One of the 20 predictions was randomly chosen at the end of the experiment and participants could earn 15 CHF if the performance prediction was within 5 percentiles of the true performance. Participants were paid according to a step function with smaller bonuses paid for less accurate predictions: For every additional 5 percentiles difference between the prediction and true performance of the student the bonus was reduced by additional 3 CHF. Therefore, there was no bonus if the prediction was more than 25 percentiles away from the true performance. Participants earned on average 6.10 CHF as a bonus.
To generate the recommendations from the other human participants that were used in the main experiment, we conducted a pre-study with 200 participants on Amazon MTurk. Participants in this study were U.S. residents and at least 18 years old. There were no further exclusion criteria for the pre-study. Participants made a series of performance predictions and received a bonus payment contingent on the accuracy of one randomly selected performance estimate.
The experiment received prior approval from the ETH Zurich ethics approval board (EK 2021-N-121). Written and informed consent from participants was obtained prior to the experiment. The payment was administered by ETH DeSciL, the researchers had no access to personally identifying information about the participants. The collection of data took place between 30th of September and 11th of October 2021. The data of the pre-study was collected on 21st of September 2021. Participants expressed written informed consent.
Our study finds a general preference for algorithmic recommendations. Participants were informed that both recommendations from a human and from an algorithm are on average equally accurate, yet, already in the Delegation condition in 66% of choices participants preferred to receive recommendations from an algorithm. This share is significantly different from 50% which would be expected due to equal performance of the two sources (one-sample test of proportions, p < 0.0001). Putting a human in the loop by allowing participants to adjust the received recommendation further increases the preference for using a recommendation from an algorithm by 11% (7pp). The difference between the two treatments is significant (p = 0.01). Throughout the text, we report results and significance levels of two-sided t-tests Unless specified otherwise. Fig 2 depicts the shares of participants who chose to receive a recommendation of an algorithm across conditions. The result is reconfirmed by a probit regression controlling for an iteration and a set of demographic characteristics (S1 Table in S1 File). The difference is largely driven by a share of participants who always preferred an algorithm to a human in the Human-in-the-Loop condition (see S6 Fig in S1 File, Kalmogorov-Smirnov test of the equality of distributions, p < 0.001).

While the direction of the effect is in line with the results of [22], who find that allowing people to make small corrections to the algorithm increases uptake, the level of the effect and the fact that we find a preference for an algorithm even in the Delegation condition is of interest. Earlier work by [9] had documented widespread algorithm aversion when participants learn that an algorithm can err, leading the authors to suggest that humans may forgive other humans mistakes but remain skeptical to (imperfect) algorithms. Their study also documented that without receiving feedback about the performance of the algorithm, people are either indifferent between receiving the (superior) algorithmic advice or prefer it. In our experiment, the strong preference for an algorithm is striking as unlike in [9] the algorithm and human recommendations were equally good and participants knew that both the statistical model and the other human make mistakes. Yet, an important caveat to this comparison, which only reinforces our result, is that, in the mentioned study participants decided between receiving the algorithmic recommendation or not and not between the source of recommendation. In [11, Experiment 3] where participants choose between the source of recommendation, the share of participants choosing an algorithm in human-in-the-loop treatments is somewhat higher than documented in this paper. [11] find that 88% of participants preferred an algorithm over a human recommendation. The difference to our somewhat lower share might be possibly explained by the almost perfect performance of the algorithm in their study. As we are interested in studying the role of the nature of the recommendation source abstracting from potential performance differences, in the description of the sources in our experimental setting we attempted to convey comparable reliability of the sources. We informed participants about their identical average performance and carefully chose wording to describe them (see S9 Fig in S1 File for the relevant part of the experimental instructions). Nevertheless, readers should be aware that differences in the description of the sources of recommendations might affect the preferences exhibited by participants.
Result 1. We find a general preference for receiving recommendations from an algorithm rather than from another human. Moving from a full delegation of the decision to a Human-in-the-Loop system increases the uptake even further.
In the Human-in-the-Loop condition, participants also report having more confidence in their own estimates than do the participants in the Delegation condition (41 out of 100 in Delegation, 48 out of 100 in Human-in-the-Loop, p = 0.008). In general, the result that a Human-in-the-Loop system not only increases uptake but also confidence of the users mirrors the results of [22]. Interestingly, although the participants knew that a human and an algorithm are on average equally accurate, participants of both treatments felt more confident about the recommendations by the algorithm (57 out of 100 as compared to confidence of 46 for human estimates, p < 0.0001). This question was asked at the end of the experiment and can only inform us about ex post confidence.
Result 2. Participants in the Human-in-the-Loop condition are more confident in the performance predictions they submit.
A crucial question is how accurate, i.e., how close to the true performance of a student, the performance predictions are. As recommendations that participants receive are by design largely identical, the difference in accuracy of final predictions comes from the adjustments the participants can make in the Human-in-the-Loop condition. We measure accuracy as an absolute deviation between a submitted decision and a true performance percentile of a high school student. A smaller deviation between the prediction and the true performance indicate a more accurate prediction. It emerges that the decisions in Delegation condition, where participants could not adjust the received recommendation, are significantly more accurate than in Human-in-the-Loop (17.4 and 18.0, p = 0.04, see S1 Fig in S1 File). This result is in line with previous literature that finds that algorithmic forecasts tend to be superior to human ones in a variety of domains [e.g., 11, 3133]. Recall that in the experiment performance predictions of human participants used as recommendations in the main experiment were curated to be of an equal quality with an algorithm.
Result 3. Adjustments made by human monitors in the Human-in-the-Loop condition lead to the average decrease in the decision accuracy.
As the overall accuracy decreases in the Human-in-the-Loop condition, it is important to consider how people engage with the recommendations they receive and where inaccurate adjustments of recommendations happen. In the Human-in-the-Loop condition the recommendation was pre-filled. This design choice made it easy for participants not to engage with the recommendation and simply rubberstamp it due to default effects [e.g., 16, 34]. If human in the loop blindly accepts recommendations by the algorithm, it raises concerns as to how much they contribute to the desirable features of the system such as maintaining human agency and accountability.
This appears to be less of a concern in our experiment: In 63% of estimations in Human-in-the-Loop treatment participants adjusted the provided recommendation. The average adjustment was 6.9 percentiles (6.7 for recommendations received form an algorithm and 7.1 from another human). To consider if participants are less likely to adjust recommendations received from an algorithm and how the source of the recommendation affects the accuracy of performance predictions, we construct a panel and estimate a fixed effects model. It allows us to focus on the systematic difference in adjustments by the source of recommendation abstracting from individually invariant characteristics. As participants made four choices and in 40% of cases participants were assigned to an alternative recommendation source only 8.7% of participants in the Human-in-the-Loop treatment were exposed only to algorithmic or to human recommendations and had no within subject variation.
We first consider if participants are more likely to adjust the recommendation altogether depending on its source and then if (conditional on being adjusted) the adjustments systematically differ (see Table 1). We fail to find evidence for algorithmic bias on the extensive margin: participants are equally likely to adjust the received recommendations regardless of the source (Table 1, specification 1). Yet, if participants intervene, the size of the adjustment is larger for human recommendations (Table 1, specification 2). Our preferred specification is specification 2 that considers the size of adjustment among the participants who engaged with recommendation and adjusted it. This approach allows to abstract from any differences in the levels of engagement in general, which (although are shown insignificant as per column 1) might bias the results. We report the alternative approach of considering the effect of the source of the recommendation on the size of adjustment including zero adjustments in specification (3) and document a marginally significant effect.
Column (1) reports estimates of fixed effects logit for a binary outcome (adjust a recommendation or not). The decisions of 6 participants (120 decisions) were omitted because of all positive or all negative outcomes. Columns (2)-(4) report results of fixed effect models on the size of an adjustment and inaccuracy respectively. Column (2) reports coefficients conditional on non-zero adjustment of the recommendation. Column (3) lifts this restriction.
doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0298037.t001
On average the predictions submitted following the recommendation by an algorithm tend to be (insignificantly) less accurate than the recommendation by a human (18.3 and 17.7 percentiles from the true performance, Table 1, specification 4). As provided recommendations for each profile are in most of the cases identical (at most 2 percentile) and as participants appear to be correcting human recommendations by more, this suggests that participants may particularly struggle with correcting algorithmic recommendations.
Result 4. Participants are equally likely to intervene following the recommendations from either source. Yet, in line with automation bias, conditional on intervening the size of the adjustment is smaller for algorithmic recommendations.
The human monitor in Human-in-the-Loop systems is intended to supervise an algorithm and interfere if decisions it produces are inaccurate. One can argue that the task of the monitor is not to correct every recommendation of the system, but to spot and correct recommendations that contain a large error. To consider if monitors in the Human-in-the-Loop treatment are better at correcting larger as compared to smaller errors, we classify the recommendations that are least accurate (in the top 25% of the absolute deviation from the truth) as larger errors. Following this definition, profiles where the recommendation is at least 26 percentiles away from the true performance were classified as large errors. Our results suggest that human monitors are less likely to intervene when the recommendations are least accurate (64% adjusted a recommendation if it had a small error and 60% if large, p = 0.02). If participants decide to intervene, the size of the adjustment is significantly larger for smaller mistakes than for larger ones (adjustment of 11.3 for smaller error and 9.6 for larger ones, p < 0.001). The fixed effects and pooled OLS specifications reconfirm this result (see Table 2). We do not find an additional interaction effect: Larger errors are adjusted by less regardless of the source of recommendation. These results suggest that human monitors fail to serve as an emergency brake for the recommender system. The results are not sensitive to variations in the definition of large errors and hold if treated as continuous. In fact, the larger the error the less likely people are to interfere and the smaller is their adjustment. S2 Table in S1 File reports the estimation without the classification of errors.
In model (1) the decisions of 6 participants (120 decisions) were omitted because of all positive or all negative outcomes. In models (2) and (3) we estimate an OLS specification with standard errors clustered at the individual level. (4) and (5) report fixed effects specification.

We additionally explore what features of the profiles or received recommendations tend to increase the likelihood that the participants intervene and affect their accuracy (see S3 Table in S1 File). We find that seeing low or high recommendations on the profile decreases the likelihood that the participant adjusts the recommendation. As low and high recommendations we classified recommendations that fall in the lowest 25% (below 42 percentiles) and highest 25% (above 65.5 percentiles) of the distribution. The results under other definitions of low and high recommendations are qualitatively similar.
Result 5. Human monitors are less likely to adjust recommendations that contain larger errors and, if they do so, correct them less than those with smaller errors. Participants tend to intervene less with very high or very low recommendations.
Our design allows to see if participants who chose a certain source of recommendations are better able to monitor its recommendations as compared to those who were exogenously assigned to it. Our results do not offer strong evidence of a selection. Participants might be more likely to adjust a recommendation from an imposed source (Chosen 62% and Imposed 65%, ttest p = 0.07). Yet, this result is not robust (see S4 Table in S1 File). Furthermore, there is no difference in the size of the adjustments or their accuracy if we compare those who selected themselves to receive a certain type of recommendations and those who were exogenously assigned (S4 Table in S1 File, specifications 3 and 4).
Result 6. We do not observe that participants are better able to monitor the recommendations stemming from their preferred source.
As we conduct our experiment at the leading technical university, our sample might be believed to be more technology friendly than general population. Our participants generally report to be positive towards algorithms and statistical models. On the scale from 0 (strongly negative) to 100 (strongly positive) average answer is 67 with the distribution skewed to the right (S2 Fig in S1 File). Yet, even in this sample the attitudes towards using algorithms to make economic, legal or other important decisions that may affect a human are mixed with an average reply of 50 and almost uniform distribution along the scale (S3 Fig in S1 File). Regardless of their attitudes towards the use of algorithms for such decisions, even our technology friendly participants are almost unanimous that a human needs to always remain in the loop (0 never, 100 always, average 75.3 with over 30% of participants choosing 100 and 50% of participants choosing values larger than 85, S4 Fig in S1 File). However, as our results show, while Human-in-the-Loop increases acceptance of algorithmic recommendations, as such it does not guarantee neither higher accuracy of decisions on average nor avoiding extreme mistakes.
Result 7. Our sample is in general technology friendly and technology-savvy, yet the majority is of the opinion that that algorithms used for important decision-making should (almost) always be monitored by a human.
Automated decision-making can exist in many variations, from a full delegation of the decision to the automated agent to the human staying in the loop. This study considers how such differences in the distribution of decision authority between humans and automated decision supports affect the human principals willingness to use and engage with them. It has also considered the effects on decision accuracy, highlighting a potential trade-off.
In more details, and as the first main finding, our experiment documents a widespread willingness to use automated decision supportsthat is, in contrast to some previous studies, our experiment fails to document algorithm aversion. Indeed, when given the choice, the majority of participants across all treatments prefers to receive an estimate produced by an algorithm over the one produced by an equally well-performing human. This preference for algorithmic recommendations becomes even stronger if participant can remain in the decision loop to monitor or intervene. If allowed to adjust the recommendation, participants are also more confident in the resulting decisions regardless of the source of the recommendation. We hence find that people are not algorithm-averse, in particular when the automated decision is construed with a human-in-the-loop. In line with public opinion surveys [25, 26], a clear majority of participants thinks humans should remain involved in automated decision-making when these decisions are legally, economically or similarly important.
However, we also find that when the human monitors are allowed to adjust recommendations in such a Human-in-the-Loop setup, the accuracy of the performance predictions decreases. Participants are even found to be less likely to intervene when the errors in the recommendations are largerand, if they do intervene, they correct these larger errors by less. In other words, if the main motivation of putting a human in loop is quality control, human monitors seem to fail at their task. Yet, as stated above, our participants state a clear preference for keeping human monitorseither revealing that they are unaware of this accuracy reduction or showing that they are willing to forego some decision quality in return for keeping human oversight. Future studies to investigate this further could prove insightful.
When interpreting the results, two caveats deserve special attention: First, for the purpose of the experiment, the recommendations from the other human/the algorithm were curated to be equally accurate, both on average and for each iteration of the task. In reality, ample empirical evidence suggests algorithms generally make better forecasts than humans [e.g., 32, 33, 35]. In our experiment participants who chose a human recommendation did not necessarily make less accurate final performance predictions and therefore lower uptake of the algorithmic recommendations did not affect the quality of the decisions.
Second, in our experiment human interventions decreased accuracy. Accuracy of adjustments may depend on the expertise of human monitors and information available to them. Regarding the former point, one may argue that engaging experts as monitors would improve the quality of human interventions. Yet, based on the previous literature it also seems sensible to suggest that our participants may have relied on the recommendations more than experts would have, thus improving their accuracy [e.g., 11]. On the latter point, our experiment tested an environment where human monitors had access to and could process the same information as the algorithm. In a more sophisticated system, the number of features incorporated into the automated recommendation may exceed human capacity. If this is the case, human monitors may have to rely on inferior (or at least limited) information when deciding on the adjustment or may be overwhelmed if all features included by the algorithm are revealed in an attempt to make the system more explainable [36]. This imbalance may increase the risk of decreasing decision accuracy due to human intervention further.
For the discussion of how to best design environments that involve automated decision-making (e.g., the EUs General Data Protection Regulation, EUs Artificial Intelligence Act, or the Council of Europes discussion on a potential AI convention) our results may be informative as they point to a trade-off: the experiment shows a case where the retention of human involvement may improve the uptake of algorithmic recommendations, yet decrease accuracy of the final decisions. The resolution of this trade-off is bound to be context-specific and depend, among others, on the decision at hand, the performance and reliability of automated supports and human monitors. Yet, our results demonstrate that including a human-in-the-loop as a default for all hybrid decisions might not be desirable. More generally, our findings show the need for careful consideration of the distribution of agency in automated decision-making situations.

2024-05-24 16:31:51,935 - root - INFO - Content: India is mainly an agricultural country. Irrigation is a vital component of agricultural production. Irrigation is a process of applying controlled amount of water to plants at regular interval. There are various technological improvements in irrigation including automated irrigation. Compared to manual irrigation, automated irrigation system can save water and maximize productivity. Automated irrigation system can be either closed/feedback control system or open/non-feedback control system. Feedback control systems monitors environmental parameters to control irrigation. Closed loop control system can be either plant/crop based system or soil based system. This paper reviews the various closed loop automatic irrigation system and proposes an automated irrigation system using thermography. The proposed system uses an IR thermal camera to capture IR image of plant canopy. Captured IR image is superimposed with digital image to identify water deficit area and corresponding valve is opened to start irrigation. The amount of water to be applied is controlled by soil moisture sensor deployed on agriculture field. When sensor value reaches the predefined threshold value corresponding valve is closed to stop irrigation. Efficient water management system is proposed by using plant or leaf canopy temperature to start irrigation.

Data management is growing in complexity as large-scale applications take advantage of the loosely coupled resources brought together by grid middleware and by abundant storage capacity. Metadata describing the data products used in and generated by these applications is essential to disambiguate the data and enable reuse. Data provenance, one kind of metadata, pertains to the derivation history of a data product starting from its original sources.In this paper we create a taxonomy of data provenance characteristics and apply it to current research efforts in e-science, focusing primarily on scientific workflow approaches. The main aspect of our taxonomy categorizes provenance systems based on why they record provenance, what they describe, how they represent and store provenance, and ways to disseminate it. The survey culminates with an identification of open research problems in the field.

The plant water status can be estimated via measurements of the Stem Water Potential (SWP) using Scholander pressure chamber. The objective of the present work was to demonstrate the application of Model Predictive Control (MPC) for managing grapevine irrigation via midday Stem Water Potential at two levels: (1) MPC was used to determine SWP reference values for the whole season, and (2) MPC was used to estimate twice a week the irrigation required to achieve the desired SWP.

Abstract Rice is one of the most important staple foods in the world. In Europe, Italy is the main producer of rice, with almost all production concentrated in the northeast of the country. Traditionally, rice is grown in fields that are flooded from before planting until just before harvest. This water management technique requires a great deal of labour for farmers who have to manually adjust the inlet and outlet gates to maintain a constant ponding water level in the fields, especially when there is fluctuation of water supply at the farm inlet, for example as a result of rainfall. In addition, the practice of flood irrigation is very water-intensive. New technologies based on remotely and automatically controlled gates are being studied to increase the efficiency of this irrigation method. The objective of this work is to explore the potential of a coordinated and intelligent system of gates for efficient farm irrigation management and ponding water level maintenance. Based on information and measurements from a real case study consisting of a 40-hectare paddy rice farm located in northern Italy, where automatic gates and water level sensors were placed at strategic points of the farm canals and fields, respectively, a proportional-integral (PI) and a non-linear model predictive control (NMPC) of water levels were implemented and compared through modelling and simulation experiments. The results show that the proportional-integral control reproduces the actions that the farmer uses when faced with situations of surplus of water in the fields or a shortage of water in the farm canal. In particular, the general coordination of the gates is lost, and the individual binomial field-gate prevails as an independent system in the farmer's operation. Conversely, non-linear predictive control coordinates the gate operation to obtain a uniform ponding water level in the fields when there is a shortage of water, or significant water conservation when there is an excess of water as a result of rainfall. In conclusion, a nonlinear predictive control model seems to be a suitable strategy to advance irrigation management in rice farms, allowing rice farmers to continue the tradition of flooding while increasing its performance.

Introduction Rice is the third most produced crop in the world and a staple food for more than half of the world's population, mostly living in developing countries (Fukagawa and Ziska, 2019). In this context, Italy is the leading rice producer in Europe, accounting for more than half of the total production of this high-value crop (Facchi et al., 2018). Typically, rice is grown in fields that are flooded from planting to pre-harvest, and this traditional irrigation technique (i.e., continuous submergence) is considered an important sink of water resources. This technique is dominant in most areas and is characterized by low irrigation efficiency (Cesari de Maria et al., 2016). In addition, irrigation management requires a lot of human labour, as it is still based on maintaining a predetermined water level in the paddies by manually regulating the irrigation inflow rate (Masseroni et al., 2017). In this context, the application of flexible and automatic control devices for irrigation management in paddy rice farms appears to be a viable solution that can be exploited to (i) increase the water use efficiency of rice cultivation and (ii) reduce the effort dedicated to irrigation flow rate regulation at field and farm scale, without changing the traditional irrigation flooding practices. More specifically, hydraulic infrastructures based on a system of coordinated gates located at strategic points of the farm irrigation network can allow to maintain optimal water levels in the farm channels and rice plots, providing more consistent and reliable irrigation flows through the farm service points. A recent review on the identification of smart automatic irrigation techniques for sustainable rice environments shows that there is a great potential for water conservation through the use of automatic and coordinated gate systems in permanently-flooded rice farms, with benefits in terms of both increasing the quality and quantity of crop production (Champness et al., 2023). Nevertheless, the review highlighted that these systems applied in paddy rice contexts are still in an embryonic stage and their application is limited to individual rice plots (Masseroni et al., 2018). Table 1 shows the degree of automation and sensor components developed in the main automated gravity surface irrigation system experiments for rice. In general, all have successfully developed a desktop-based system for remote control of irrigation, but only Masseroni et al. (2018) have

In addition, insufficient water supply and high rate of water loss due to evapotranspiration increases plant stress which often affects its growth and development. Therefore, to address this issues, this paper is aimed at developing a model predictive control (MPC) strategy for water saving drip irrigation experiment that will regulate the soil moisture content within the desired field capacity and above the wilting point, while scheduling irrigation to replace the loss of water from soil and plant due to evapotranspiration in the greenhouse environment. The controller design involves a data driven predictive model identified and integrated with the MPC designer in MATLAB and thereafter exported in Simulink for simulation. The generate controller code was modified and deployed on a Raspberry Pi 4 controller to generate a pulse width modulated signal to drive the pump for the control water mixed with fertilizer. To achieve enhancement of controller an Internet of Things (IoT) integration was used for easy soil, weather, and plant monitoring which are used to update the MPC model for the irrigation control. The performance of the proposed MPC controller deployed drip irrigated Greenhouse(GH1) is benchmarked against an existing automatic evapotranspiration (ETo) model based controller in Greenhouse(GH2), with each greenhouse containing 80 poly bags of Cantaloupe plant with similar growth stage. The results obtained shows that, the proposed MPC-based irrigation system has higher water productivity index of 36.8 g/liters, good quality of fruit with average sweetness level of 13.5 Brix compared to automatic ETo-based irrigation system with 25.6 g/liters and 10.5 Brix, respectively. However, the total mass of harvested fruit for ETo-based irrigation system is higher than MPC-based irrigation system by 21.7%. The performance of the proposed MPC controller was achieved through the integration of event based scheduling with IoT monitoring as well as inclusion of evapotranspiration effect in the plant dynamics.

Introduction Water is one of the most precious resources on the earth, it is therefore imperative to measure, control and preserve for sustainable agricultural production and healthy living. The severe global competition for food and water is due to the effect of increase in world's population and climate change. This has increased the interest on how to achieve optimal use of scarce resources such as water using precision irrigation aimed at increasing food production and water saving [1]. The rate of water loss known as reference evapotranspiration (ETo) from plant and soil is dependant on the nonlinear dynamic change of soil, plant, and weather interaction. The regular change in evapotranspiration has effect in the available water in the soil for plant use, as a very high rate of ETo could lead to plant wilting. This remains a significant issue affecting the control strategies for crop irrigation, as there is a need for irrigation controller to adaptively adjust to the dynamic variations of soil, plant and weather parameters to ensure effective irrigation management [2]. Commonly, most farmers do not consider these dynamic varying factors when making irrigation scheduling decisions, which may lead to many draw backs such as low water use efficiency, reduced yield and more energy usage in driving pumps to supply of water for irrigation [3]. Consequently, the real time monitoring of weather, soil, and plant parameters within a cultivation environment using Internet of things (IoT) as well as wireless sensor networks (WSN) can enable the realization of smart management of different methods irrigation systems [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. There are various control strategies that can be used for irrigation management. The irrigation control strategies are basically categorized in open loop and close loop control methods. Irrigation decisions using open-loop control approach are managed based on the farmer intuition and using either on or off irrigation timers to control opening and closing of valves. The irrigation timing and volume is often specified and applied based on the farmers experience without considering sensors feedback on the changing parameters that has effect on plant such as soil moisture contents, and other weather parameters [11], [12], [13] The issues affecting with open-loop control of irrigation system affected by various environmental disturbances such as evapotranspiration, effect of different growth stage requirement of plants (Kc), and requires regular adjustment to ensure better performance [14]. The close loop control approach has been reported to be able to address the issue associated with open loop through the use of sensor based signal as feedback to keep the measured output condition close to the desired trajectory while deciding the duration of water supply to plants [14,15]. Research work on close loop control of irrigation have been implemented through simulation using the linear control approach such as proportional integral differential (PID) [16], [17], [18], [19], [20] and also linear quadratic regulator (LQR) [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]. The works reported a good control performance through simulation, but their real time deployment on hardware was not thoroughly explored. Similarly, several works on intelligent control such as fuzzy logic and expert system approach where rules and formulated based on expert knowledge of the dynamics of the system was used to decide the timing and volume irrigation were carried out [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36]. This method has proven to be effective, but the drawback of this method is that no matter how well formulated the rules are, there will always be situations that don't exist in the rules. In most cases fuzzy based irrigation controllers are not often adaptive to the varying dynamics of plant, weather, and soil parameters. Also, reported in literatures is

Abstract The future of agriculture faces a threat from a changing climate and a rapidly growing population. This has put enormous pressure on water and land resources as more food is expected from less inputs. Advancement in smart agriculture through the use of the Internet of Things and improvement in computational power has enabled extensive data collection from agricultural ecosystems. This review introduces model predictive control and describes its application in precision irrigation. An overview of the application of data-driven modelling and model predictive control for precision irrigation management is presented. Model predictive control has been applied in irrigation canal control, irrigation scheduling, stem water potential regulation, soil moisture regulation and prediction of plant disturbances. Finally, the benefits, challenges, and future perspectives of data-driven model predictive control in the context of irrigation scheduling are presented. This review provides useful information to researchers and agriculturalists to appreciate and use data collected in real-time to learn the dynamics of agricultural systems. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords 1. Introduction The current and future generations face significant challenges in ensuring that nutritious food is sustainably produced from limited land and water resources. The FAO's food and agriculture report of 2020 posits that 40% of the world population are inhabitants of water-scarce agricultural areas; of these, 37% inhabit agricultural zones with severe water scarcity [27,51]. Coupled with the rising population indices, meeting the food demand by 2050 will need a 70% increase in food production [28]. In addition to developing quick maturing and high-yielding plant varieties, scientists need to ensure that less water is used to produce more food. It is estimated that about 70% of the water abstracted for irrigation is lost through conveyance losses and poor water allocation methods [76]. This means that a lot of water is presently used to produce a unit of food. Improving water use efficiency in irrigation systems requires intelligent irrigation monitoring and control systems to ensure that no water is wasted and precise water application is achieved [15]. Sustainable precision irrigation presents a timely solution to water wastage in irrigated agriculture by ensuring that intended irrigation amounts are applied at the right time and place. Precision irrigation scheduling is striving to achieve efficient water use per plant, in space and time, in the right quantities to compensate for losses. This is possible through effective monitoring and optimal control strategies, reducing pumping costs. Over the years, there has been a paradigm shift from traditional irrigation methods to smart irrigation systems. This has somewhat improved the water use efficiency by reducing conveyance losses. However, irrigation control is still a challenge due to the complex nature of agricultural systems. For example, most irrigation systems are designed based on historical climatic data, and irrigation schedules are developed based on this data. Precision agriculture has been facilitated by the tremendous advancement in the agricultural Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) through remote sensing [32,69]. The controlled monitoring of agricultural systems has enhanced the sapience of the changing dynamics of the water, plant and soil environment throughout the cropping season [5]. With advances in Big data analytics, more agricultural systems are becoming data-driven for decision-making purposes rather than relying on heuristic physics-based models [68]. Sustainable irrigation necessitates the adoption of irrigation control strategies that precisely direct irrigation water to the plant's root zone. Boman et al. [11] observed improved water, energy, and fertilizer use efficiency when precision irrigation control strategies are implemented. Precision irrigation control strategies are divided into two, namely, closed-loop systems and open-loop systems. Whereas open-loop systems apply a preset action like in simple irrigation timers, closed-loop systems receive feedback from sensors, make decisions and implement the resulting findings in the irrigation system [15]. Several authors have reviewed and classified closed-loop irrigation control strategies into three, namely, linear control, intelligent control and optimal control [4,15,23]. Model predictive control has evolved over the past four decades with advances in real-time data measurements and an increase in computational power. Model Predictive Control (MPC) refers to a category of advanced computer-controlled algorithms that use an explicit process model to predict a plant's future response [23]. Developed in the 1960s, Model Predictive Control emanates from optimal control. The basic principle of MPC is to use a dynamic model to predict system behavior and optimize the prediction to decide the control move at the current time [71]. In addition to its flexibility, Model predictive control repeatedly solves constrained optimal control problems online ([57]b). The ability to handle multivariate processes and address state and input constraints has made MPC indispensable in modern manufacturing industries [23,56,55,70]. In a control problem, the model predictive controller's goal is to compute the plant input to follow the desired reference [60]. MPC uses a plant model to predict future plant output behavior and an optimizer that ensures that the predicted plant output tracks the desired reference [15,60] MPC has been widely studied and applied in processing industries

Due to the over-water harvesting from the Zayandehrud River (mainly for agricultural purposes), the Gavkhuni wetland in central Iran is facing serious water stress. Hence, the aim of this study is to rehabilitate the Gavkhuni wetland by considering the water management scenarios in the agricultural sector. These scenarios are modernization and upgrading the operation of agricultural water distribution systems (A), upgrading in-farm irrigation systems (B), optimizing the cultivation pattern (C) and reducing the utilization of groundwater resources (D), and combining these scenarios together as strategic scenarios to provide ecological water right. In order to evaluate the strategic scenarios for allocating water resources to the wetland, the Zayandehrud basin was simulated using the WEAP model by considering the water resources and uses. For evaluating the presented scenarios based on the sustainable development indicators and due to the uncertainty and intuitive judgment of decision-makers, the fuzzy-CP model was applied. The results showed that water consumption management in the agricultural sector plays a significant role in increasing the inflow to the wetland. This is achieved through the modernization and upgrading of agricultural water distribution systems using two approaches: centralized control (model predictive control) and decentralized control system (proportional-integral), which improve irrigation efficiency by 13.1%, modify cropping patterns by 18.8%, and reduce groundwater extraction by 30%, resulting in a 49.1 and 19.1% increase in inflow to the wetland, respectively. Additionally, the combination of four scenarios indicated a more than 100% increase in the inflow volume to the wetland. The prioritization of scenarios based on a fuzzy agreement multi-criteria decision-making model demonstrated that scenarios ABCD, ACD, and A have a higher priority in increasing the inflow to the wetland compared to other scenarios.

In these areas, wetlands as bird habitats play a vital role in the socio-environmental system (Mitsch and Gosselink, 2007). Numerous factors such as limited water availability, land use change, water consumption pattern, increasing water demand, and most importantly non-compliance with the priority of water resources allocation cause the environmental sector to face water shortage challenges and lead to the gradual degradation of the wetland (Darvishi Boloorani et al., 2023). Meanwhile, water restriction in terms of allocation is the most important factor in the drying of wetlands, especially in arid and semiarid regions, such as Iran (Hassan, 2005). One of the most important issues regarding the right to water in wetlands is the exploitation of water resources upstream without considering the effect of those actions on ecosystem stability (King et al., 2021; Banihabib and Najafi Morghmaleki, 2018). This highlights the importance of improving water management in the agricultural sector to increase the volume of water allocated to the environment and its rehabilitation. One of the scenarios to improve water consumption management, regarding the poor performance of most agricultural water distribution systems, is to improve the management of the operation in these systems to reduce water losses in the agriculture sector (Shahdany et al., 2019). Irrigation efficiency in the agricultural sector is the ratio of estimated irrigation water needs to actual water withdrawal. Water efficiency is dimensionless and can be applied at the factory, farm, project as well as at the basin and country scales (Bwambale et al., 2022). In this regard, it is necessary to achieve the mentioned goal by upgrading and updating the operation systems in irrigation channels (Li et al., 2022). The self-control systems include the centralized control system (MPC) and the decentralized control system (PI). Studies show that the local controller is preferred due to its ease of use in irrigation channels (Zamani et al., 2015). Generally, when the number of channel intervals and flow fluctuations is limited, classical controllers such as decentralized control system (proportional-integral (PI)) methods perform well in practical cases (Vanoverloop, 2005). However, since irrigation systems consist of a wide network of channels and multiple structures, the irrigation network channels form a complex system with various disturbances, requiring the use of centralized automatic control systems (Wagemaker, 2005). Among modern control algorithms, the centralized automatic control system has attracted more attention from researchers compared to other methods. Its high acceptance is mainly due to its ability to solve multivariable control problems, consider system actuator constraints, operate closer to physical limits, and provide rapid updates (Fele et al., 2014). Wagemaker (2005) first tested the MPC method on a real irrigation channel. The channel tested in this research is the WM Arizona subchannel in the USA,

ABSTRACT Irrigation canals are the constructed channels connected by different control structures to convey water from supply sources to farmers, municipal, industrial, and outdoor recreational uses according to a specific schedule. It is crucial that the conveyance canal and its related structures can be designed and operated to perform their functions efficiently and satisfy user demands and minimize costs and water loses. The objective of this chapter is to introduce the current knowledge on irrigation canal design, canal model, canal control, and canal optimal management. The design standards and processes for an irrigation canal are summarized to include the Best Management Practices to deal with seepage losses. The hydrological and hydraulic model of the system and their integrated model are the basic tools to better understand the water movement and balance of the canal system. An irrigation canal hydraulic model can be developed using the Saint-Venant equation combined with the flow control internal boundary conditions to provide fast and accurate prediction to simulate flow states change with time and space in the canal system. The soil and water assessment tool is the popular tool for understanding the hydrological processes in the irrigation canal watershed and the irrigated field. The integrated hydrological and hydraulic models have been established to deal with the reservoir-based irrigation system and estimate the seepage losses for the irrigation canal system. Canal control methods, canal flow routing algorithm, and automatic canal control are introduced to improve canal operation with better controls on frequency, flow rate, and duration of their water supply. A lot of irrigation systems have been modernized with automatic technology to improve system efficiency and management effectiveness of every component of the system (reservoirs, canals, and gates). A set of model predictive control (MPC) approaches of automatic control techniques have been summarized for different applications optimization to optimize the canal operation. The MPC is the power tool to determine the control actions that maintain water levels after disturbances to obtain the system-wide multiple variable optimum performance. In summary, the innovation of automatics and improved hydrological and hydraulic models provide an opportunity to leverage the optimal management on the irrigation cannel. The development of more complex algorithms with nonlinear prediction models and the consideration of uncertain or errors are possibilities to be explored to validate the controller in the actual irrigation canal.

RTC-Tools toolbox is used to enable sustainable operational water management. Abstract This work presents an assessment of the potential of model predictive control (MPC) of a Dutch polder system. The system drains to the Linge river and includes 13 weirs, 4 hydraulic gates and 4 large pumping stations each equipped with multiple pumps, managed by the Water Board Rivierenland. The management of the system must comply with several goals: keep the water levels within the bounds of safety, pump out the excess water at minimum cost or CO2 emission, but always have enough water for irrigation and shipping. To achieve these goals there are weirs regulating the water level in different pools, pumping stations to pump water in and out and gates to let water in and out by free flow when possible. These pumping stations consume large amounts of energy. We propose multi-objective mixed-integer optimization by using goal programming to prioritize different operational objectives. For the control of the pumps mixed-integer optimization is used, which makes it possible to not only model the energy consumption of the pumps while in operation, but also to model if the pumps are turned on or off. The control system is implemented using RTC-Tools, an open-source software tool to implement MPC. It is demonstrated that the proposed control system implementation can comply with the operational goals of the water board: keeping the water levels within the bounds while reducing the operational costs. The proposed control system has been tested numerically on data from the year 2013, and it is shown that it highly outperforms the current operation.

Introduction Low-lying countries have to constantly discharge water to keep their land dry by pumping excess water to the sea, while all the demands of the different users of water should be satisfied. With global warming and increasing sea level this task is going to present more challenges. Operational water management provides solutions for achieving the desired distribution of water taking into account, the amount, the time and the location. The distribution of water occurs by operating hydraulic structures such as pumps, weirs and gates. During the management of a system with such structures, several factors have to be taken into account: safety, ecology, and requirements related to agriculture, navigation, and recreation. Multi-objective programming techniques can solve such problems. RTC-Tools is a decision support system for water management, able to use multi-objective optimization and multi-objective programming techniques [1]. In this work the development and use of additional components of this decision support system are described and an application is presented. Model predictive control (MPC) has been used to control different kind of water systems [2]. MPC is especially suitable for water systems due to its capability of dealing with model-based predictions, known disturbances (such as weather forecasts or tidal motion, day-ahead energy price forecasts), unknown disturbances (such as unknown inflows or water level changes caused by unmodeled processes) and finally time delay. Its first use was for irrigation and drainage systems [3], [4], [5]. It is often used for reservoir operation [6], [7] and not only for water quantity but also for quality control [8]. Due to the complexity and price of the development and infrastructure, there are only few real implementations [9]. MPC has been used in water systems including pumps to minimize their power consumption, but they were mainly drinking water systems and the dynamics of the pump was often not taken into account in the modeling phase. The pump-dynamics is a discrete, non-linear and non-convex process, which implies that it is computationally hard to solve and multiple local optima exist. In many polder systems, the pump head and pump discharge both may vary over 50% to 100% of the design duty point of the pumping stations. Therefore, correct modeling of the pump behavior (head, discharge and power) is essential to minimize energy cost or energy consumption. [10] use stochastic model predictive control on a reservoirpumpwindturbine system, but the dynamics of the pumps are not taken into account. One way to overcome the heavy computational burden is to not minimize the energy used by the pumps directly, but the number of switching intervals [11] or total on-time of the pumps [12]. [13] used a similar approach for a water distribution system (modeled by system identification) in which the number of pumps turned on was minimized. The disadvantage of these approaches is that they are hard to combine with other objectives and to integrate into a complex system. There are some studies that include pump-dynamics into the optimization. [14] uses continuous optimization for drinking water systems, and uses post processing to discretize and then to obtain the pump-schedule. [15] does

Renewable energy usage efficiency can be improved via the integrated CEA model. Abstract Renewable energy consumption in agriculture is ascending, catering to the food needs of the rising population and protecting the environment. Maximizing renewable energy usage efficiency is essential for achieving sustainable development goals. In this work, a nonlinear integrated controlled environment agriculture model is constructed to correlate the impact of weather disturbances, temperature control actuators, humidity control actuators, fertilization, and irrigation to the states of crop production facilities and crop growing conditions. Linearization of the model is performed to reduce the computation time while retaining the accuracy of the nonlinear model. A robust model predictive control framework is developed to maximize renewable energy power usage efficiency and maintain a hospitable sustainable cultivation environment. To improve the robustness of control to hedge against the forecast uncertainties, the disjunctive data-driven uncertainty sets built upon the historical forecast errors are constructed by using machine learning methods, including principal component analysis and kernel density estimation. This work also presents the result of the simulation of controlling a renewable energy-powered semi-closed greenhouse growing tomatoes located in Ithaca, New York. Compared to other model predictive control frameworks, which do not leverage the machine learning approaches, the proposed control framework enables a 0.7%66.9% reduction in renewable energy usage and a 0.7 wt% to 16.1 wt% increase in crop production. Further analysis of this work reveals that the integrated controlled environment agriculture model can help in increasing renewable energy usage efficiency from 4.7% to 127.5%.

Optimal operation of reservoirs is of paramount importance for better management of scarce water resources under competing multiple demands such as irrigation, water supply etc., with decreasing reliability of these systems under climate change. This study compares six different state-of-the-art modeling techniques namely; Deterministic Dynamic Programming (DDP), Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP), Implicit Stochastic Optimization (ISO), Fitted Q-Iteration (FQI), Sampling Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SSDP), and Model Predictive Control (MPC), in developing pareto-optimal reservoir operation solutions considering two competing operational objectives of irrigation and flood control for the Pong reservoir located in Beas River, India. Set of pareto-optimal (approximate) solutions were derived using the above-mentioned six methods based on different convex combinations of the two objectives and finally the performances of the resulting sets of pareto-optimal solutions were compared. Additionally, key reservoir performance indices including resilience, reliability, vulnerability and sustainability were estimated to study the performance of the current operation of the reservoir. Modeling results indicate that the optimal-operational solution developed by DDP attains the best performance followed by the MPC and FQI. The performance of the Pong reservoir operation assessed by comparing different performance indices suggests that there is high vulnerability (~ 0.65) and low resilience (~ 0.10) in current operations and the development of pareto-optimal operation solutions using multiple state-of-the-art modeling techniques might be crucial for making better reservoir operation decisions.

Reservoir management is a complex process since it is often quite difficult to allocate the available water for different purposes such as water supply, irrigation and hydro-power generation while at the same time ensuring various demands/requirements expected from the system is satisfied within its physical constraints (Adeyemo 2011). These requirements also include flood control/regulation and environmental flow to support ecosystems along the stream and river. (Votruba and Broa 1989). Reservoir operational polices are developed using different techniques to help the reservoir operator to make the release decisions (Reddy and Kumar 2006; Tayebiyan et al. 2016). These policies are generally developed based on the inflow characteristics, antecedent conditions, demand, weightage for competing objectives (e.g. hydro-power generation and flood control) under multi-objective operational conditions, historic knowledge of inflows and discharge decisions, and discretion of the operator who makes the release decisions (Dobson et al. 2019). Developing pareto-optimal operational solutions (pareto-optimality refers to a situation where it is not feasible to improve any objective without degrading at least one other objective) might be the most practical strategy to make reservoir operations under competing demands (Reddy and Kumar 2006; Castelletti et al. 2014; Yang et al. 2009). The decision-making of reservoir operation is complex, since it may involve thousands of decision variables based on the objectives of the operation and constraints of the system (Yeh 1985). Some physics-based hydrological models such as Streamflow Synthesis and Reservoir Regulation (SSARR) and HEC-5 are being widely used for multi-objective reservoir system modeling (Ozkaya and Zerberg 2021; Ahn et al. 2018). However, these models have several limitations due to uncertainty in the input data, implicit assumptions, difficulty in the interpretation of results and finally due to the intrinsic limitations of the model (McMahon 2009; Dang et al. 2020). To overcome the limitations of physics based models, different techniques from management sciences along with optimization algorithms have been widely used to manage water reservoir systems (Yeh 1985; Heydari et al. 2015). One advantage of using these data-based methods over physically-based methods is their ability to model with very few input variables (mostly only inflow time series is sufficient), which also significantly reduces uncertainties and biases caused by errors or assumptions in the input data and antecedent conditions (Uysal et al. 2016; Turner et al. 2020). The choice of the method, however, depends upon various factors including the physical characteristics of the systems, objectives of operation, data availability and the specified constraints, since no particular general algorithm exists for modeling reservoir operation (Pulido-Velazquez et al. 2016; Kaczmarek and Kindler 1982; Dobson et al. 2019). In general, widely used reservoir operation models includes, simulation models, linear programming (LP), dynamic programming (DP) and non-linear programming models (Yeh 1985). However, all these models have several limitations such as curse of dimensionality, curse of modeling and curse of multiple objectives, or combination of the above curses (Powell 2007; Giuliani et al. 2016; Dobson et al. 2019). To overcome these limitations, combinations

Mobilizing political will and building institutions 2 Executive Summary By 2050 the worlds population will reach 9.1 billion, 34 percent higher than today. Nearly all of this population increase will occur in developing countries. Urbanization will continue at an accelerated pace, and about 70 percent of the worlds population will be urban (compared to 49 percent today). Income levels will be many multiples of what they are now. In order to feed this larger, more urban and richer population, food production (net of food used for biofuels) must increase by 70 percent. Annual cereal production will need to rise to about 3 billion tonnes from 2.1 billion today and annual meat production will need to rise by over 200 million tonnes to reach 470 million tonnes. This report argues that the required increase in food production can be achieved if the necessary investment is undertaken and policies conducive to agricultural production are put in place. But increasing production is not sufficient to achieve food security. It must be complemented by policies to enhance access by fighting poverty, especially in rural areas, as well as effective safety net programmes. Total average annual net investment in developing country agriculture required to deliver the necessary production increases would amount to USD 83 billion. The global gap in what is required vis--vis current investment levels can be illustrated by comparing the required annual gross investment of US$209 billion (which includes the cost of renewing depreciating investments) with the result of a separate study that estimated that developing countries on average invested USD 142 billion (USD of 2009) annually in agriculture over the past decade. The required increase is thus about 50 percent. These figures are totals for public and private investment, i.e. investments by farmers. Achieving them will require a major reallocation in developing country budgets as well as in donor programmes. It will also require policies that support farmers in developing countries and encourage them and other private participants in agriculture to increase their investment. In developing countries, 80 percent of the necessary production increases would come from increases in yields and cropping intensity and only 20 percent from expansion of arable land. But the fact is that globally the rate of growth in yields of the major cereal crops has been steadily declining, it dropped from 3.2 percent per year in 1960 to 1.5 percent in 2000. The challenge for technology is to reverse this decline, since a continuous linear increase in yields at a global level following the pattern established over the past five decades will not be sufficient to meet food needs. Although investment in agricultural R&D continues to be one of the most productive investments, with rates of return between 30 and 75 percent, it has been neglected in most low income countries. Currently, agricultural R&D in developing countries is dominated by the public sector, so that initially additional investment will have to come from government budgets. Increasing private sector investment will require addressing issues of intellectual property rights while ensuring that a balance is struck so that access of smallholder farmers to new technologies is not reduced. Hunger can persist in the midst of adequate aggregate supplies because of lacking income opportunities for the poor and the absence of effective social safety nets. Experience of countries that have succeeded in reducing hunger and malnutrition shows that economic growth does not automatically ensure success, the source of growth matters too. Growth originating in agriculture, in particular the smallholder sector, is at least twice as effective in 3 benefiting the poorest as growth from non-agriculture sectors. This is not surprising since 75 percent of the poor in developing countries live in rural areas and their incomes are directly or indirectly linked to agriculture. The fight against hunger also requires targeted and deliberate action in the form of comprehensive social services, including food assistance, health and sanitation, as well as education and training; with a special focus on the most vulnerable. Many countries will continue depending on international trade to ensure their food security. It is estimated that by 2050 developing countries net imports of cereals will more than double from 135 million metric tonnes in 2008/09 to 300 million in 2050. That is why there is a need to move towards a global trading system that is fair and competitive; and that contributes to a dependable market for food. Reform of farm support policies in OECD countries is a welcome step which has led to a decline in the aggregate trade distortion coefficient from 0.96 in 1986 to 0.74 in 2007. However, there is clearly still room for improvement. There is also a need to provide support and greater market access to developing country farmers so that they can compete on a more equal footing. Countries also need to consider joint measures to be better prepared for future shocks to the global system, through coordinated action in case of food crises, reform of trade rules, and joint finance to assist people affected by a new price spike or localized disasters. Climate change and increased biofuel production represent major risks for long-term food security. Although countries in the Southern hemisphere are not the main originators of climate change, they may suffer the greatest share of damage in the form of declining yields and greater frequency of extreme weather events. Studies estimate that the aggregate negative impact of climate change on African agricultural output up to

Most of this increase will be met by the products of irrigated agriculture. At the same time, the water input per unit irrigated area will have to be reduced in response to water scarcity and environmental concerns. Water productivity is projected to increase through gains in crop yield and reductions in irrigation water. In order to meet these projections, irrigation systems will have to be modernized and optimised. Water productivity can be defined in a number of ways, although it always represents the output of a given activity (in economic terms, if possible) divided by some expression of water input. Five expressions for this indicator were identified, using different approaches to water input. A hydrological analysis of water productivity poses a number of questions on the choice of the water input expression. In fact, when adopting a basin-wide perspective, irrigation return flows often can not be considered as net water losses. A number of irrigation modernization and optimization measures are discussed in the paper. Particular attention was paid to the improvement of irrigation management, which shows much better economic return than the improvement of the irrigation structures. The hydrological effects of these improvements may be deceiving, since they will be accompanied by larger crop evapotranspiration and even increased cropping intensity. As a consequence, less water will be available for alternative uses.

A sensor-based irrigation system is presented as an alternative, as this can provide several benefits to nurseries and nursery-grown seedlings. Small-sized soil water sensors that could fit in small-volume nursery containers (25 to 100 mL), and could be integrated into an automated irrigation system, are reviewed. Several experiments have been conducted internationally to measure soil water status of small-volume containers in soilless substrates, and a large body of knowledge is now available. In this review, we describe the principles of several currently commercially available sensors that can be adapted to this purpose, giving advantages and disadvantages of each type. We conclude that a sensor-based irrigation system has great potential to address the challenges associated with irrigation scheduling, while improving water usage in most nurseries.

Effective management of water for crop production in water scarce areas requires efficient approaches. Increasing crop water productivity (WP) and drought tolerance by genetic improvement and physiological regulation may be the means to achieve efficient and effective use of water. But only high water productivity values carry little or no interest if they are not associated with high or acceptable yields. Such association of high (or moderate) productivity values with high (or moderate) yields has important implications on the effective use of water. In this paper we discussed the factors affecting water productivity, and the possible techniques to improve water productivity. A single approach would not be able to tackle the forthcoming challenge of producing more food and fiber with limited or even reduced available water. Combining biological water-saving measures with engineering solutions (water saving irrigation method, deficit irrigation, proper deficit sequencing, modernization of irrigation system, etc.), and agronomic and soil manipulation (seed priming, seedling age manipulation, direct- or wet-seeded rice, proper crop choice, integrating agriculture and aquaculture, increasing soil fertility, addition of organic matter, tillage and soil mulching, etc.) may solve the problem to a certain extent. New scientific information is needed to improve the economic gains of WP because the future improvements in WP seem to be limited by economic rather than a lack of technological means.

The growing population will result in considerable additional demand for food. Simultaneously, water demand from non-agricultural sectors will keep growing in both developed and developing countries. About 40% of the land in the world is under arid and semi-arid climatic conditions (Gamo, 1999). Efficient use of rainwater and optimization of crop water productivity (WP) are important in such conditions. An FAO analysis (FAO, 2003) of 93 developing countries expects increase of agricultural production over the period 19982030 by 49% in rain fed and by 81% in irrigated regions. Therefore, much of the additional food production is expected to come from irrigated land, three quarters of which are located in developing countries. In developing countries, the irrigated area in 1998 has nearly doubled than that in 1962. FAO estimates that the irrigated area in the selected 93 developing countries will only grow by 23% over the 19982030 periods. However, the effective harvested irrigated area (considering the increase in cropping intensity) is expected to increase by 34%. This means that more area needs to be brought under irrigation to produce more crops with the present available water resources. In the dry areas, water, not land, is the most limiting resource for improving agricultural production. Maximization of yield per unit of water (water productivity), and not yield per unit of land (land productivity), is therefore a better strategy for dry farming systems. Under such conditions, more efficient water management techniques must be adopted. Water deficiency and low availability of nutrient often limit crop growth and production potential in agro-ecosystems because most crops are sensitive to water and nutrient deficits during different critical stages. On the other hand, excessive use of water can increase the production cost and pollute the environment (enhancing fertilizer leaching). So enhancement of water productivity (also termed as water use efficiency) in agriculture is very important. It is widely believed that an increase in agricultural water productivity is the key approach to mitigate water shortage and to reduce environmental problems. This paper therefore discussed the factors that may affect actual water productivity in irrigated and dry-land agriculture and highlighted the measures or possible ways to improve water productivity. 2. Concepts and scale considerations of water productivity Water productivity may carry different meanings to different people, and may differ between but also within groups of water users (Kijne et al., 2003, Tuong et al., 2005, Zoebl, 2006, Playan and Mateos, 2006, Dugan et al., 2006, Wesseling and Feddes, 2006). It can be defined with respect to different water-using production sectors (e.g. crop production, fishery, forestry, domestic and industrial use) (Igbadun et al., 2006) as the amount of output produced per unit of water involved in the production, or the value added to water in a given circumstance. To a hydrologist, it means the ratio of the volume of water used productively, i.e., transpired and in some cases also evaporated, from the area under study, to the volume of water potentially available for that purpose. In fisheries, it might mean the ratio of fish produced to the volume of water used. To an economist, it might mean the monetary value of output divided by that of the necessary water input. To an irrigation engineer, it might mean the ratio of the amount or the value of crops produced in a farm (or catchment) to the supplied water. Even a crop scientist can use WP in different aspects: leaf WP (leaf photosynthetic rate per transpiration rate), whole plant WP (the ratio of aboveground biomass or dry matter per unit area to water use), yield WP (crop grain per unit area to transpiration) (Hong-Xing et al., 2007). In essence, WP represents the output of a given activity to the water input. Where there is inter-cropping or multiple culture (crop + fish), monetary return per unit of water input is the best option. In agriculture, we are interested to produce more with less water because water is a limiting factor in many parts of the world. Water is an

Precision irrigation manages the water utilization and reduces the utilization of energy. The irrigation system consists of observation system, storing, processing and it helps in decision making as well. Internet of Things (IoT) components is used to observe the various informations, such as soil moisture, soil temperature, weather conditions, and environmental conditions from the fields. With the help of various information, the proposed work optimizes the requirements and thus reduces energy. The cloud environment is used to store the observed parameters from the IoT components. The machine learning algorithm is useful in taking the process of data, from the cloud environments, and do forecasting on the irrigation system. In this work, proposed a hybrid model for irrigation system and do the decision making using, different observation of parameters. This work consists of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting-based Tree (GBT), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Spearman's rank correlation. The KNN is used to gather the nearest sensing information, with the help of various parameters. The GBT is used to predict the real values based on the observations. The LSTM is used to predict, time series prediction using different observations of the surrounding. The Spearman's rank correlation is used to receive the correlated values of real, and time series prediction. Using the GBT, LSTM and spearman rank correlation, the consolidated time series forecasting values are predicted in irrigation. The implementation of proposed work is done with the help of banana species in the time period, between Feb 2020, Dec 2020 and 2021. The duration of the cultivation, minimum and maximum water requirements and other supporting parameters are calculated using various sensors. The real and time series water requirements are calculated in the time interval of 12, 24, 36 and 48 etc. With the help of this time series data, month-wise prediction is performed. The implementations were performed in single and group of banana tree water requirements. After implementation of proposed work, for single banana tree 31.4 % of the water requirement has been optimized in 2020 time period. Due to this optimized irrigation, heavy usage of fresh water usage and energy wastage is also reduced. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Introduction Agriculture is the biggest field which consumes fresh water and electricity in the whole world [1], [2]. About 70% of water is used for agriculture and it consumes huge units of electricity, as well. Out of this, only around 25% of water and electricity are being consumed efficiently, and the remaining is being wasted away [3], [4]. Water is useful for entire process of agriculture and electricity is being used in various activities such as planting, sowing, spraying, weeding, and harvesting. So, the usage of fresh water and electricity is high, likewise, the wastage is also high. The optimization techniques reduce the usage of water and electricity [1], [2]. On the other hand, the effective usage of water increases crop productivity. Thus, for the efficient usage of water and electricity, optimization method is needed for todays society. The trending technologies have decreased the water and electricity usage in various fields and it is essential in today world. Different electronic components, techniques, algorithms have been introduced by different researchers on optimization [4]. Nowadays, IoT and machine learning technologies, helps in many ways to decrease the energy usage and to increase the productivity in many fields. Few application fields of IoT and machine learning are, Industries, Road Transport, agriculture, Optimizations, etc. This work has used both IoT and machine learning for energy optimization and effective utilization of water in irrigation systems. IoT is the combination of interrelated devices such as firmware, mechanical, and few programming as well. The IoT devices are used to collect data, and, the collected data are being managed, using cloud computing. Machine learning is an automated technique that improves efficiency through past experience. Some of the efficient machine learning algorithms and mathematical models are Bayesian Statistics, KNN, Neural Network, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), etc. These learning mathematical models are used to make effective analysis and decision-making in various applications. An article [27] has been introduced to automate the agriculture process as small, moderate and high to reduce the cost. KNN, Logistic Regression (LR) and DT algorithms have been proposed to handle loads of agriculture for 562 former cases. An advanced machine learning based agriculture for smart cultivation has been proposed [28]. In this work, parameters like phosphorus, rainfall, surface temperature, crop rotation have been taken to test performance of smart agriculture. Multiple linear regression was the algorithm introduced to check the performance. The IoT and Machine learning-based technique for energy optimization and effective utilization of irrigation systems has three processing layers, such as: i. Data gathering/collection and transmission ii. Data processing and intelligence layer iii. Application Layers i. Data gathering/collection and transmission Data gathering/collection and transmission ii. Data processing and intelligence layer Data processing and intelligence layer iii. Application Layers Application Layers The above layers have different functionalities and components. Data gathering and transmission are performed in the first stage and it collects the information from the fields or agricultural grounds, and transmits for data processing. For the data collection and processing, certain physical components (sensors) are used. The components of data collection and transmissions devices are, Wi-Fi or Mobile data connections, ZigBee Network for local area data processing, Wireless sensor Node (Single Sensor Node, Multiple sensors Node) for data collection from the ground and atmosphere, Raspberry Pi, controlling components and other physical devices, are for controlling the

Using SysFan and SPSS22.0 as tools, a combined quantitative and qualitative approach is employed to comparatively analyze the lexical density and grammatical intricacy across the renowned ancient Chinese poem Pipa Xing \u7435\u7436\u884cand its nine English translations. The findings reveal that while the translations exhibit comparable levels of lexical density, disparities in complexity primarily manifest in terms of grammatical intricacy, reflecting distinct text features: spoken, written, and mixed spoken and written, as well as varying degrees of hierarchical and narrative features. The variations in translation styles are intricately linked to the individuation process undergone by translators. The translator\u2019s individuation process is modeled to show how a translator mobilizes the meaning resources in the repertoire, which is constrained by the allocation of the cultural reservoir, to re-instantiate the source text in the translated text, while constructing affiliation with the target-reader community. Different translators\u2019 allocated repertoires ultimately shape their conscious or unconscious choices in terms of lexicogrammar, thereby generating translated texts characterized by diverse styles.",

                "dc:description": "Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), the most common congenital heart disease, is prone to develop significant valvular dysfunction and aortic wall abnormalities such as ascending aortic aneurysm. Growing evidence has suggested that abnormal BAV hemodynamics could contribute to disease progression. In order to investigate BAV hemodynamics, we performed 3D patient-specific fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations with fully coupled blood flow dynamics and valve motion throughout the cardiac cycle. Results showed that the hemodynamics during systole can be characterized by a systolic jet and two counter-rotating recirculation vortices. At peak systole, the jet was usually eccentric, with asymmetric recirculation vortices and helical flow motion in the ascending aorta. The flow structure at peak systole was quantified using the vorticity, flow rate reversal ratio and local normalized helicity (LNH) at four locations from the aortic root to the ascending aorta. The systolic jet was evaluated with the peak velocity, normalized flow displacement, and jet angle. It was found that peak velocity and normalized flow displacement (rather than jet angle) gave a strong correlation with the vorticity and LNH in the ascending aorta, which suggests that these two metrics could be used for clinical noninvasive evaluation of abnormal blood flow patterns in BAV patients.",

This phenomenon extends to the general population, whereby elevations of serum phosphate within the normal range increase risk; however, the mechanism by which this occurs is multifaceted, and many aspects are poorly understood. Less than 1% of total body phosphate is found in the circulation and extracellular space, and its regulation involves multiple organ cross talk and hormones to coordinate absorption from the small intestine and excretion by the kidneys. For phosphate to be regulated, it must be sensed. While mostly enigmatic, various phosphate sensors have been elucidated in recent years. Phosphate in the circulation can be buffered, either through regulated exchange between extracellular and cellular spaces or through chelation by circulating proteins (ie, fetuin-A) to form calciprotein particles, which in themselves serve a function for bulk mineral transport and signaling. Either through direct signaling or through mediators like hormones, calciprotein particles, or calcifying extracellular vesicles, phosphate can induce various cardiovascular disease pathologies: most notably, ectopic cardiovascular calcification but also left ventricular hypertrophy, as well as bone and kidney diseases, which then propagate phosphate dysregulation further. Therapies targeting phosphate have mostly focused on intestinal binding, of which appreciation and understanding of paracellular transport has greatly advanced the field. However, pharmacotherapies that target cardiovascular consequences of phosphate directly, such as vascular calcification, are still an area of great unmet medical need.",

In this study, Buddhism and compassion are proposed to extend the sustainability mindset framework in understanding key leaders' sustainable decision making to achieve a balance between concerns for environmental, societal, and economic outcomes. Data from a survey of 142 key leaders who are business owners, entrepreneurs, and managers in SMEs and startups in Vietnam provide evidence that Buddhist teaching and lifestyles are important predictors of key leaders' sustainable decision making through the mediator of compassion. Furthermore, the study also revealed that Buddhism positively and significantly influences compassion. This research, thus, makes contribution to the extant literature regarding factors influencing key leaders' sustainable decision making. Practical implications are also discussed.",

Narrative accounts were drawn from 30 participants who were identified as deeply empathic. The epistemic contours are sketched through five themes describing: the complexity of boundary permeability, embodied knowing, expansive spiritual identifications, reacting versus responding, and various keys to developing and integrating resonant knowing. Both significant difficulties and profound meaning were described, highlighting the problems with and potential in deep empathic capacity. This resonant knowing captures an epistemic style more consistent with contemporary understanding of embodied cognition as well as concepts of a more interconnected worldview. Implications for integrating knowing and being for both individual growth and for an emergent cultural episteme were identified.",

                "dc:description": "Background: The neonatal congenital heart disease (NCHD) screening program has advanced in China. However, there are still some missed cases after discharge from maternity hospitals. Moreover, parents\u2019 cognitive level and compliance with congenital heart disease (CHD) management are limited. The current disease reporting system, which relies on medical personnel, encounters issues with data omission and misreporting, exacerbated by the manual follow-up process\u2019s inefficiency. Involving parents in NCHD management mitigates challenges arising from population mobility, deepens parents\u2019 comprehension of the disease, and promotes active data input, ultimately enhancing health management efficiency. Methods: We performed the key technologies, design, and architecture of the developed platform. It explores the applications of Mobile Health (M-Health) based on big data technology, representing an innovative approach to monitoring CHD that emphasizes the integration of advanced technologies such as data integration, online consultation, message reminders, and parental involvement. A feasibility assessment was conducted, involving interviews with medical staff, to evaluate the practicality and effectiveness of the system. Additionally, a preliminary analysis of platform usage was undertaken. Results: The platform demonstrated successful integration across the entire CHD management spectrum, including Parent Registration, Screening Phase, Diagnosis Phase, and Treatment Phase. It consists of a mobile APP and a back-end data management system. Parents input information on the platform, which is uploaded to the system. Then, the back-end data management system monitors the case course and provides regular reminders for the treatment and valuable related knowledge for CHD. Based on feedback from medical staff, valuable suggestions for platform enhancement were identified. A total of 891 infants from June 1, 2023, to August 31, 2023, were enrolled at two hospitals in China. Conclusions: This big data management platform sets a commendable example for the comprehensive management of NCHD. Continuous improvement in technological proficiency and security safeguards will likely enhance the platform\u2019s widespread and profound impact in future clinical practices. Timely feedback and adjustments during usage are crucial to ensuring the platform\u2019s effectiveness and adaptability, thereby guaranteeing the realization of the intended design effectiveness.",

Vedic, upanishadic and buddhist philosophers have pointed out over millennia the illusive nature of the individual self, and posit either a no-self, or a universal Self. Vedantic scholars also posit the illusory nature of the universe (Maya) and suggest that the only reality is the knower (Brahman), a view resonating with modern concepts in quantum theory. On the other hand, western philosophers, notably influenced by the Cartesian dualism, have pursued an individualist view of the self. Recent psychological literature is convergent with eastern views and emphasizes the importance of understanding the self, metacognition and mindful practices to understand the mind and its afflictions. Several recent western psychotherapeutic models resonate with, and may have been motivated, at least in part, by ancient eastern philosophy and spiritual practices. More work is needed to develop and implement psychotherapeutic approaches using eastern insights, and to empirically test their effectiveness.",

However, it is still an open question how to migrate monolithic applications to FaaS. In this paper, we present a guideline for software designers to split monolithic applications into smaller functions that can be executed in a FaaS environment. This enables independent scaling of individual parts of the application. Our approach consists of three steps: We first identify the main tasks (and their subtasks) of the application to split. Then, we define the program flow to be able to tell which application tasks can be converted to functions and how they interact with each other. In the final step, we specify actual functions and possibly merge those that are too small and which would produce too much communication overhead or maintenance effort. Compared to existing work, our approach applies to applications of any size and results in functions that are small enough\u2014but not too small\u2014for efficient execution in a FaaS environment. We evaluate the usefulness of our approach by applying it to a real-world application for the storage of geospatial data. We describe the experiences made and finish the paper with a discussion, conclusions, and ideas for future work.",

While spiritual leadership theory has received widespread acceptance and considerable empirical support, its developmental process and potential for being used to pursue self-centered ends remain underdeveloped. Drawing on non-self from the\u00a0Buddhist emptiness theory, we identify different egoistic forms of attachment at each level of being that can lead to forms of suffering in spiritual leadership. Then we show how leaders operating at lower levels of being can fall into the trap of practicing a form of pseudo-spiritual leadership that is overly focused on self-centered or instrumental purposes and economic rationality. We then introduce mechanisms to move beyond pseudo-spiritual leadership practices and discuss implications for future theory, research, and practice.",

They brought to bear reconstructed spiritual resources to address what they saw as the key challenges of their own time and context. Their work shows that without the inner transformation proposed by the ancient science of spirituality, it would prove impossible to build a society based on liberty, equality and fraternity. I would go further and argue that the insights we can draw from this science are critically essential for the very survival of humanity, indeed of all life on earth, in this era of the Anthropocene.",

(Introduction)\n\n- Driven by population growth, urbanization, and dietary changes, the demand for agricultural products, especially feed crops, is increasing. (Land Use)\n\n- Increasing yields will not be able to meet the demand for raw materials, necessitating more efficient and sustainable agricultural practices. (Land Use)\n\n- Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture is necessary, but it will limit further land allocations for agricultural purposes. (Land Use)\n\n- The production of food for the growing population is placing a strain on available land and water resources. (Introduction)\n\nThe paper concludes that agricultural production must intensify sustainably to meet the demands of a growing population while minimizing environmental impact.",

The researchers examine the potential of improved land and water management to achieve global food security, water deficits that may remain in water-scarce regions aiming for food self-sufficiency, how to meet those water deficits by food imports, the cropland expansion required in low-income countries without the purchasing power for such imports, and the proportion of that expansion pressure which would remain unresolved due to potential lack of accessible land. The research focuses on the target year 2050, where the authors intend to assess whether improved land and water management can avoid further loss of ecosystem functions from terrestrial lands, meet the increasing food demands, and provide insights into how future food demands might be met. \n\nThe researchers find that while the world will not exceed its carrying capacity despite escalated food demand, a net water deficit of approximately 2,200 km3/year in water-scarce countries is estimated. However, the study also finds a net surplus of approximately 3,960 km3/year in water-rich countries which can potentially be used to meet the water deficit in water-scarce regions.

It is typically determined from tables based on plant types and ranges from 0.8 to 1.2 for common landscape vegetation.\n2. **Vegetation Density (Kd Factor):** The Kd factor accounts for the influence of vegetation density on ET. It ranges from 0 to 1, where a Kd of 1 represents full ground cover and lower values indicate less dense vegetation.\n3. **Microclimate (Kmc Factor):** The Kmc factor adjusts ET for microclimate influences, such as shading, wind, and slope, on the reference ET (ETo). It is typically estimated based on visual observations and ranges from 0.5 to 1.5, where 1 represents the reference microclimate conditions.\n4. **Managed Stress (Ksm Factor):** The Ksm factor accounts for the impact of imposed water stress on ET to reduce water consumption. It is typically determined based on management objectives and can range from 0 to 1, where 0 represents no stress and 1 represents maximum allowable stress.\n\nBy decoupling the KL into these four factors, the approach provides a structured and reproducible way to estimate and modify landscape ET for specific conditions and management practices.",

                    "explanation": "This paper introduces AgSAT, a smartphone application that utilizes remote sensing and gridded global weather data forecasts to estimate crop water requirements on a field scale. The application's key features and functionalities are described, along with a description of the models and methods it employs for estimating reference evapotranspiration (ETref) and crop growth coefficient (Kcb). The performance of AgSAT was assessed through comparison with meteorological data from 18 weather stations across various climatic zones and temporal scales, demonstrating acceptable results with an index of agreement ranging from 0.8 to 0.98. The paper also includes a description of the app's user interface and provides a field validation of its performance in the Bekaa Valley, Lebanon, where it was used to guide irrigation scheduling for potato crops. Overall, the paper provides a detailed overview of AgSAT, its methodology, and its potential for real-time irrigation management.\n\n**The two most important quotes from the paper are:**\n\n**1. \"AgSAT uses meteorological data to calculate daily water requirements using the ASCE-Penman\u2013Monteith method (ETref) and vegetation indices from satellite imagery to derive the basal crop growth coefficient, Kcb.\"\n\n2. \"The field validation demonstrated the effectiveness of AgSAT in estimating crop water requirements and providing irrigation recommendations, resulting in a superb potato yield of 60 tons/ha.\"\n\n**Relevance Score: 0.9**\n\n**Alternate_section:** N/A\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n1. The paper does not provide information on the accuracy or effectiveness of AgSAT under different soil conditions or irrigation practices.\n\n2. The field validation study was conducted on a single crop (potato) in a specific region (Bekaa Valley, Lebanon) and may not be representative of performance under different conditions.\n\n**Inline_citation:** Jaafar, H., Mourad, R., Hazimeh, R., & Sujud, L.

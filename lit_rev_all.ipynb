Issues are presented according to major factors, such as growing population, changing dietary habits, water efficiency, climate change and volatile food prices. These factors were compiled from reports of major international organizations and from relevant scientific articles on the subject. Collecting the results and presenting them in an accessible manner may provide new insight for interested parties. Accessibility of data is extremely important, since food security and its drivers form a closely interconnected but extremely complex network, which requires coordinated problem solving to resolve issues. According to the results, the demand for growing agricultural products has been partly met by increasing cultivated land in recent decades. At the same time, there is serious competition for existing agricultural areas, which further limits the extension of agricultural land in addition to the natural constraints of land availability. Agricultural production needs to expand faster than population growth without further damage to the environment. The driving force behind development is sustainable intensive farming, which means the more effective utilization of agricultural land and water resources. Current global trends in food consumption are unsustainable, analyzed in terms of either public health, environmental impacts or socio-economic costs. The growing population should strive for sustainable food consumption, as social, environmental and health impacts are very important in this respect as well. To this end, the benefits of consuming foods that are less harmful to the environment during production are also to be emphasized in the scope of consumption policy and education related to nutrition as opposed to other food types, the production of which causes a major demand for raw materials.\\nKeywords: nutrition; agriculture; food security; hidden hunger\\n1. Introduction\\nCurrently, one of the most important challenges to achieve food security is the intensification of global food production. Most surveys and research efforts in agriculture focus on crop production. However, these analyses do not take into account the instability of yield over time or the variability and reliability of cereal production over the years [1]. As the global population continues to grow, agricultural production must also keep pace with it. Over the upcoming 40 years, agricultural emissions will increase by approximately 60% so that humanity can be supplied with food in appropriate quantity and quality. Various studies predict strong population growth within 30 years [2]. According to Röös et al. (2017) that number will be approximately 9–11 billion by 2050 [3] but the number is disproportionate in terms of territorial distribution as it is mostly based on urbanized environments [4]. Concerns about food production are not unfounded. Scientific and technological innovations beat Malthus’ predictions in 1798 over the long run and increasing food production has met with the increasing food demand of the growing population. To continue to prove Malthus wrong in the future will require serious efforts, especially in terms of agricultural livestock production [5]. If current global processes continue and population growth tendencies remain unchanged, another 2.4 billion people will live in developing countries by 2050 (in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, the population is expected to grow steadily). The size of urbanized areas is expected to increase threefold between 2000 and 2030 [6]. In these regions, agriculture is of outstanding national economic importance. In total, 75% of the world’s poorest people live in rural areas, where agriculture is their most important foundation of subsistence [7]. Nevertheless, on average, over 20% of the population living in rural areas is suffering from food supply security problems [8]. Satisfying the demand requires increased productivity, structural changes in the livestock sector and the need to increase animal products [9]. According to forecasts, the average daily intake per capita is projected to exceed 3000 kcal globally by 2050 to reach 3500 kcal in developed countries and to exceed 2500 kcal even in the poorest sub-Saharan areas [10].\\nThe demand for food, feed and crops with high fiber content is constantly increasing. So, there is increasing pressure on the already “impoverished” arable land and freshwater resources. The size and proportion of land used to produce food and feed depend largely on the evolution of global eating habits and the achievable average yields. The production of raw materials for the Western diet (involving high meat, dairy and egg consumption), which is becoming more widespread in the world, poses serious environmental challenges [11]. In addition to the competition between food and feed production, the increasing utilization of biomass also has a significant impact on land use and water management. The global food sector is heavily dependent on fossil fuels. Therefore, the volatility of energy markets might have a significant direct impact on food prices and an indirect impact on the security of food supply [7].\\nThe issues presented above have been under intensive research for several decades, surrounded by disputes in many cases. Different drives of food supply and security form a complex network, with strongly interconnected factors. The complexity of this network poses a major challenge for interested parties and requires close cooperation between parties to resolve the issues. Despite the overwhelming scientific results, some of the related areas are discussed based on emotion and by taking a subjective approach. Synthesizing scientific results and presenting them in an accessible manner may provide novel insight for related parties. This research is a comprehensive review about these issues and the possible solutions.\\n2. Materials and Methods\\nThe overall objective of this paper is to provide comprehensive research about the topic, with the processing of international and relevant literature in a literature study. Food security, nutrition and livelihood security is connected at the global and national level as well. Thereby, they are affected with the risk of so-called “shocks” such as climate disasters (drought, flood, etc.), human conflict (such as war, radical protests, etc.), pests and diseases (such as invasive species, etc.). Multi-sectoral cooperation is essential because most of the studies have shown that only a few countries have achieved fast economic growth without preceding agricultural growth. The development of food production systems is based on agricultural diversification, the conservation of water sources and efficient land usage while biodiversity is being preserved.\\nQualitative research is suitable for exploring results and situations from previous relevant research and comparing with our research. However, methodological examination regarding the data analysis process is limited, but there are no systematic rules for analyzing qualitative data. Of course, there must be a logical structure or a framework behind the analysis. Computer-assisted search engines make qualitative data analysis more efficient and faster. Qualitative research often provides results, insights and concepts rather than data analysis methods to assess hypotheses or theories. The economic impact of food security is analyzed by various, relevant studies, but there is a close relationship between the environmental and social effects (like water and soil management, climate change, energy security). In addition, upon preparing the study a combination of the following terms was applied during the search for relevant studies: food security, agriculture, population growth, food and environmental safety, food demand, yield trends, change in land use, biofuels, sustainability requirements, and mitigation of climate change. These relevant studies were mostly analyzed from Google Scholar, AgEconSearch, EconBiz.de and Scopus. The literature review is based on recent, relevant studies between 2005 and 2019. In every case, the latest database of the World Bank [12] and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) [13] was analyzed during the creation of this study. In some cases, the databases have been merged, e.g., for the exchange of currencies, the harmonization of units of measurement, the frequency of communication. These circumstances were harmonized with each other, so that there was no need to \"beautify\" the database. Based on these databases, we covered some of the major related results to gain insight into the complexity of these processes. Graphic representations can help readers to better understand the results. Data from the previously mentioned databases were analyzed by R Studio. This program supports the graphic appearance of the analyzed data. Comparing the results is difficult, since most of the results can be viewed as crude approximations of the future developments. We rather focus on the trends related to food security.\\n3. Results and Discussion\\n3.1. Land Use\\nIn recent decades, the demand for growing agricultural products has been partly met by increasing cultivated land [14]. However, in the future, the efficiency of agricultural production and specific yields must be increased, since there is serious competition for existing agricultural areas. Various relevant studies outline an increasingly gloomy prospect, namely that increasing yields will not be able to meet the demands for raw materials [15,16,17]. Nowadays, the increase in agricultural performance is mainly due to the cultivation of new areas, which is hardly sustainable in the long term. Consequently, new areas must be incorporated into agricultural production. Agricultural production needs to expand faster than population growth and this objective needs to be achieved in a sustainable way without further damage to the environment. The driving force behind development is sustainable intensive farming, which means the even more effective utilization of agricultural land and water resources [18].\\nUrbanization takes away an increasing amount of agricultural land and puts pressure on current land use and biodiversity as well [19]. According to estimations, the growing food demand will require approximately 320–850 million hectares of agricultural land additionally by 2050. The demand for additional agricultural land is limited by the changes in future dietary habits, which will mainly be influenced by socio-economic developments in developing countries. Depending on these changes, consumption will be shifted towards food sources of animal origin by 2050 due to improving welfare.\\nMoreover, this will cause a major change in land use as well, since the demand for feed crops will increase [20]. In addition, future yields based partly on the introduction of new plant varieties and improved agronomic practices will determine how much arable land will be needed. The requirement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions originating from agriculture will inevitably limit further land allocations [21]. At the same time, it should also be taken into account that the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture depends largely on the attitude of producers as they are the ones who are directly affected by the effects of climate change. Farmers who believe in climate change and its anthropogenic or man-made nature are much more open to reducing greenhouse gas emissions but, at the same time, farmers are often more easily able to adapt to changing circumstances than to reduce emissions of harmful substances [22].\\n3.2. Population\\nIt is beyond dispute that population growth is among the main drivers of global changes (notice in Figure 1). In approximately 10,000 B.C., agriculture began to develop with a global population of approximately 2.4 million people [23]. At the beginning of our chronology, Earth’s population was 188 million. As a result of the industrial revolution and the parallel development of health care and medicine, a major change occurred. By the end of the 1800s, the global population reached or already exceeded one billion people [24]. Currently, China alone has a population of 1.4 billion people [25]. The next major period was the 1930s when global population exceeded 2 billion people (when maize hybrids began to spread) (Figure 1). Due to the achievements of the Green Revolution, the global population doubled to over 3 billion (1960). It has been established that the global population grew from 1.65 billion to 6 billion during the 20th century. In 1970, there were nearly half as many people in the world as today [26]. By the middle of the 20th century, annual global population growth rose to 2.1% (1962), which is the highest annual growth rate in history. Nowadays, the growth rate has fallen to 1.2%, which is less than 80 million people annually. According to forecasts, the annual growth rate will decline to 0.1% by 2100 [27].\\nSustainability 11 05816 g001 550Figure 1. Global population growth. (Source: Own calculation and editing based on the database of FAO, 2019) [13].\\nPopulation growth in itself does not completely explain the changes in food consumption. While the volume of food consumption is dependent on the size of the population, quality of the consumed food is dependent on the average household income. According to Figure 2, there is no apparent connection between the (log of the) population and the (log of) GDP per capita, which means that independently from the population of the given countries, the GDP per capita may vary freely. At the same time, a higher GDP is more likely to be associated with a low share of agricultural added value. At the bottom of the graph, African countries possess a very high agricultural share in the GDP, while Europe at the top of the graph is very much the opposite with a high GDP per capita and a low share of agriculture (Figure 2).\\nSustainability 11 05816 g002 550Figure 2. The connection among the population—GDP per capita and agriculture, 2017a. (Source: Own calculation and editing based on the database of the World Bank, 2019) [12].\\nFigure 3 shows the connection between the share of agriculture (as value added in % of GDP) and the GDP per capita. GDP per capita is measured in current US$, plotted in logarithmic form. As the GDP per capita increases in a given country of the world, the share of agriculture decreases quickly. Generally, African countries (red color) have the highest share of agriculture in GDP among the regions, with over 30% or even more in some cases. However, at the same time, the value of GDP per capita is very moderate. Asian and African countries have a relatively low GDP per capita but high share of agriculture in GDP. The values of Asian countries are extremely diverse. At the same time, European and North American countries typically have a high GDP per capita, while the share of agriculture is only a few percent. The share of agriculture is much lower in Latin America, Oceania, Northern America and especially in Europe, mostly under 5% of the GDP. At the same time, GDP per capita is the highest among the countries. The graph indicates that African and Asian countries are still very much dependent on agriculture, as they take a high share of the GDP (denoted by red and orange).\\nSustainability 11 05816 g003 550Figure 3. The relationship between GDP per capita and the share of agriculture in GDP, 2016. (Source: Own calculation and editing based on the database of the World Bank, 2019) [12].\\nIn Figure 4, a similar methodology-based editing can be noticed. It deals with the connections between energy consumption, agriculture and the GDP per capita. With these elements, the latest database is from 2013. It also indicates the regions with different colors and the GDP per capita value in US dollars. The “X” axis represents the energy usage (in kg of oil equivalent per capita) and the “Y” axis represents the share of agriculture in the GDP. It can be read that energy use per capita is very low in the case of Africa—the value is well under 2500 kg of oil equivalent per capita. A correlation also can be discovered between the agricultural share in the GDP and energy usage. In regions, where the share of agriculture in GDP is high (over 20%), there is a low value energy use per capita (under 2500 kg of oil equivalent per capita). In general, as a country became more industrialized, energy demand increased rapidly and, at the same time, the share of agriculture in the GDP quickly took a downturn. It can be concluded that countries with a high consumption of energy have much higher living standards in terms of the GDP per capita compared to countries with low energy consumption.\\nSustainability 11 05816 g004 550Figure 4. The main connections between energy consumption, agriculture and the GDP per capita, 2013. (Source: Own calculation and editing based on the database of the World Bank, 2019) [12].\\nIt is also worth noticing that the relationship is not linear. Below the 2500 kg of oil equivalent per capita consumption, a small increase in the energy use comes with a rapid decrease in agricultural share in the GDP. Above this level, no further change is expected. According to the regional distribution, Africa shows a lower level of energy consumption and the share of Asia varies between the lowest levels and the highest levels of oil consumption.\\n3.3. Crop Biology\\nCrop production and harvest research have traditionally been limited to studies on the physiology and genetics of plants, the creation of new plant varieties, the development of new agricultural chemicals and the development of better agronomic methods [28]. Such research is necessary and there is an increasing number of global initiatives, which are aimed at the achievement of higher cereal yields [29]. Similarly, reducing the yield gap is also a keen research topic and objective, since it is becoming more and more justifiable for many crops to increase yields. Genetic enhancements are likely to be the potential solutions for achieving maximum yields for plants of key importance. There is considerable potential for improvement in yields and flexibility in the so-called \"orphan crops\". These crops have not been genetically modified yet and they are not traded on an international level. Consequently, less attention is focused on them in terms of their agricultural utilization. As they receive less research attention, breeding technology of \"orphan crops\" is lagging behind modern technology (e.g., millet, cowpea, manioc, etc.) [30]. On the other hand, agricultural research is increasingly driven by problems of a wider scope, such as the expected decline in yields due to climate change and severe weather events [31]. In addition to problems elicited by weather, the focus of research is on the emission of greenhouse gases and the pollution of water associated with the production of nitrogen-based fertilizers [32,33,34].\\nSimilarly, research on pests and diseases is important as they are also major risk factors in the case of yield differentials and, due to the effects of climate change and efforts to conserve biodiversity, they are considered as urgent factors [35]. Due to the concerns about soil degradation discussed above, all agricultural practices related to conservation should be applied for the sake of yield improvements, such as tillage and other measures such as the conservation of crop residues and the application of crop rotations [36]. In order for agriculture to meet the emerging challenges it faces, new scientific discoveries should be adapted into practice as soon as possible. In addition, closer cooperation between farmers and scientists is required to integrate new developments appropriately into developments that complement agricultural practices [37]. Nevertheless, the use of genetically modified plants still sets off contradictions among researchers. The debate is mainly present between representatives of natural science and social science; however, it must be resolved in order for the reasons of aversions towards technologies to become understood [38]. Especially, as the latest technological advancements, for example, the application of genome editing in agriculture—and indirectly in food production—might exceed the significance of current GMO crop production [39]. GMO crops can play a radically different role in certain markets: while they have been present in the US since the mid-1990s [40], their distribution in other countries is strictly prohibited.\\n3.4. Reasons of Changing Eating Habits\\nConsumption patterns are constantly shifting towards products of animal origin and dairy products that contain higher value added, which results in the increasing demand for the production of feed crops. This process is already typical as, between 1960 and 2010, global arable land per capita decreased from 0.45 to 0.25 hectares and by 2050, it is expected to shrink to less than 0.20 hectares [41]. Approximately 66% of agricultural land is currently used by livestock farming in the European Union as well. This ratio is 40% on a global scale and is expected to rise further by 2050 [41]. According to the data above, dietary change will have a more prominent impact on land use than population growth. The problems mentioned above could be addressed by putting emphasis on wider cultural changes, which focuses on the necessity for coordinated actions of government and political activities, industry, communities, family and society. Recognizing the social needs and attitudes of consumer behavior, a number of research studies analyzing dietary changes are published, which increasingly reveal the routine nature of consumer habits and the institutions and infrastructure supporting them [42,43,44]. Initiatives aimed at the promotion of healthier and more sustainable patterns of consumption should address the social and technical systems that are able to respond to changing consumer habits. According to certain research activities, the decision-making process for choosing a diet might force consumers to face various ethical challenges [45]. For example, consumer preferences for organic food (with respect to health or sustainability) or the need for locally produced food (minimizing the so-called \"food miles\"). Obviously, these preferences greatly influence the decision-making process of consumers in relation to the choice of diet [42]. In addition, it should be emphasized that the sustainability of the food supply could be significantly improved even by the reduction of food losses [46].\\nThe growing population should strive for sustainable food consumption, as social, environmental and health impacts are very important in this respect as well. To this end, the benefits of consuming foods that are less harmful to the environment during production are also to be emphasized in the scope of consumption policy and education related to nutrition as opposed to other food types, the production of which causes a major raw material demand [47]. In several countries—at primary schools—lunch break is a basic place of the learning process, where students learn about hygiene, healthy eating habits and/or recycling waste. Acquiring knowledge about healthy eating and recycling waste is fundamental at a young age [48]. Current global trends in food consumption are unsustainable, analyzed in terms of either public health, environmental impacts or socio-economic costs [49]. On different geographic scales, there are clear correlations between the socio-economic situation and the intake of high-quality food and the resulting health outcomes. The change in production structure is caused by the increase in the number of people with higher incomes in low- and medium-income countries. Primarily, this induces a change in consumption habits through the increasing consumption of meat, fruit and vegetables compared to different kinds of cereals [50]. The fact that the seasonal consumption of fruit and vegetables completely disappears is a particularly interesting development. From this point of view, transportation can be a critical factor of environmental impact. Currently, a person eats an average of 42 kg of meat annually, which is expected to rise to 52 kg by 2050, and 1.5 billion new consumers will appear on the market [27]. The growing share of poultry meat among other kinds of meat should be mentioned here. Due to changing eating habits, more and more people consume chicken meat. It can be produced relatively quickly, it is relatively cheaper, and it is not prohibited by religions.\\nThe focus of research is increasingly shifted towards the relationship between nutrition and food production, especially the problems caused by climate change, increasing population and urbanization. As an example, many studies on Africa have been published [51,52], which have pointed out that there is a need for intervention at a social level to modify nutrition habits and to avoid malnutrition. Areas that are different in terms of public health so far are likely to become even more diversified, as low-income countries in particular find it more difficult to adapt to the consequences of climate change, food shortages and water shortage, as well as to the associated socio-demographic changes and the resulting dietary modifications [53]. Subsequent research activities and their practical implementation should address the impact of dietary changes on the natural environment and the impact of environmental changes on all components of food safety [20].\\nThe integrated approach of agri-food research draws attention to the impact of social and political conflicts on health and malnutrition. Changes occurring in the environment might aggravate malnutrition by limiting the ability to produce food products. Extreme weather events (for example drought and floods) might contribute to the volatile change in food prices, which in extreme cases might result in serious problems, in the form of riots or the further increase in the proportion of famine [54].\\n3.5. Links between Nutrients and “Hidden Hunger”\\nThere is a detectable positive change in the reduction process of global famine. However, despite progress, the world is still far from a sustainable food safety system. Obesity is a phenomenon that exists nearly in parallel with famine and malnutrition. Nearly 800 million people are chronically underfed in terms of energy intake, while 2 billion people suffer from micronutrient deficit, but at the same time 1.9 billion people are overweight or obese [55,56].\\nPeople suffering from hidden hunger typically consume food items with high calorie but low nutrient content, which can easily lead to obesity (although not necessarily). This also proves that famine and obesity, as well as under- and overnutrition occur in parallel at a global scale. This means the inadequate consumption of sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements. Therefore, it is interesting that overnutrition (in calories) may be associated with malnutrition (micronutrient). It will be a great challenge for the future to produce food of not only sufficient quantity but quality as well. As a summary of the above, three phenomena appear as contradictions but parallel to each other: malnutrition, overnutrition, and hidden hunger. These three forms of nutritional problems are also referred to as the \"triple burden\" of malnutrition [57]. This triple effect contributes to the reduction of physical and cognitive human development, the loss of productivity, sensitivity to infectious and chronic diseases and aging [58].\\nMicronutrient-deficient nutrition is a global phenomenon that may affect certain social groups, such as those over the age of 65 even in the most advanced countries [60]. Reduction of the various forms of malnutrition requires better food policy and targeted nutrition-related interventions. In Africa and Asia, urban populations are growing at a high rate, which may lead to a further decrease in per capita nutrients (an average reduction of 36% in Africa, 30% in Asia) (Figure 5). A possible solution for slowing down the process might be nutrient reuse. In contrast, average per capita amount of nutrients in Europe will decrease by 10%, but a steady decline in population numbers is also expected here [61]. Obviously, these analyses are limited by certain factors as they do not take into account, for example, the size of the city or changes that have occurred in terms of land use. By 2030, urban expansion will require an additional 2% of the available global land, but local effects might be more significant in the life of individual cities, affecting reuse opportunities and making adaptive decisions [8].\\nSustainability 11 05816 g005 550Figure 5. Map of hidden hunger. (Source: Muthayya et. al. (2013) [59]).\\n3.6. Climate Change and Water\\nAccording to estimations, climate change has already reduced global crop yields of maize and wheat by 3.8% and 5.5% respectively and researchers are warning that further decline in productivity is expected as temperature changes exceed critical physiological thresholds [62]. The progressively extreme climate change increases production risk and puts an increasing burden on the subsistence of agricultural producers. Climate change also poses a threat to the food supply of both rural and urban populations. Extreme climatic events have a long-term negative impact, since exposure to risk and increasing uncertainty affect the introduction of effective economic innovations. Consequently, the number of low-risk but low-yield activities begins to increase [31]. Agricultural activity also contributes to warming the planet. Total carbon dioxide emissions from agriculture in 2010 were equal to 5.2–5.8 gigatons of CO2 equivalent annually, representing approximately 10%–12% of global anthropogenic emissions [63]. Agricultural categories with the highest level of emission are fermentation, manure, synthetic fertilizer and biomass combustion. Considering that there will be a need for further increases in agricultural production, the emission of harmful substances is also expected to increase. The main source of planned emission growth is the application of conventional agricultural techniques (as opposed to precision farming) that will result in the further, severe damage of the ecosystem, such as further water and soil pollution [64]. Some recent publications discuss the impact of climate change on yields, especially for the most important crops, such as wheat, maize, rice and soybean [65,66,67,68,69], which means that scientific processing of the topic is ongoing.\\nCurrently, 97.5% of Earth’s water resources are saltwater and only 2.5% is freshwater, 69% of which are glaciers and persistent snow, 30.7% groundwater, and 0.3% in the form of lakes and rivers [41]. There is some similarity between freshwater resources and land in terms of their availability. If we look at both factors on a global level, they are available in sufficient quantities, but the distribution is very uneven. This is also illustrated by the fact that there are huge differences between countries in the same regions, but even within countries. Demand for water is expected to increase by 100% by 2050, which can be attributed to population growth, urbanization and the effects of climate change [70]. As the urban population grows, household and industrial water consumption are expected to double. Climate change implies a greater chance of more extreme weather phenomena, because of which water consumption of crop production might increase considerably [70].\\nHumanity consumes the most water in the course of food production and global production of cereals. Due to increasing food production, water resources from the rivers and groundwater are primarily used for the irrig', 'unique_identifier': 1}\n",

Before Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of United Nations, we have heard his earlier colleagues Waldheim, Boutros Gali and Kofi Annan all call for decisive efforts towards global food security. Still today, the number of malnourished in the world stays stubbornly close to one billion people, despite the latest commitment of the world community through the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDG) to half hunger by 2015, only 6 years from now. Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations, in his recent article “The new face of hunger”, stressed that an urgent response is needed, that global food stocks are at historic lows, and that agricultural production must be boosted (Ki-moon 2008). Nothing less than a new green revolution is required to lift people out of hunger in Sub-Saharan Africa, the most vulnerable region in the world in terms of food and poverty.\\n\\nIn the 2008-report on MDG-achievements, rising food prices and increasing concerns over water scarcity put in doubt the ability to achieve future global food security under a business as usual approach: rural populations are suffering from the cumulative neglect over decades of the agricultural sector (UN 2008). This crisis has highlighted the importance of giving greater attention to developing the agricultural sector and addressing the needs of rural populations. Moreover, the report stresses the urgency of ensuring that the present course of action be accelerated and expanded. It also stresses the fact that international trade negotiations are years behind schedule and the need for corrective action.\\n\\nDespite rapid urbanization, 70% of the world’s poor live in rural areas, which makes local agriculture central to increased production and socio-economic development. Earlier analyses indicated a certain level of congruence between poverty, under-nutrition and hydro-climatic water scarcity (Rockström et al 2007). Although there is not a universal one-to-one relation, the conclusion, supported by the Comprehensive Assessment on Water Management in Agriculture (CA 2007), is that the world’s savannah zones (the semi-arid tropical regions, generally defined as drylands) constitute a global hot-spot in terms of great water challenges, high levels of poverty and malnourishment. These facts call for special attention to be paid to the agricultural production potential of the semiarid tropics. Also, the increasing river depletion in irrigated regions has contributed to focusing new attention on rainfed agriculture and the potential of micro-agricultural water management technologies (AWM) for food security (Falkenmark and Molden 2008, CA 2007; Merrey and Sally 2008).\\n\\nWhen discussing rainfed agriculture, the analysis of freshwater availability is based on the green and blue water framework developed by Falkenmark and Rockström (2004). Blue water resources are defined as the generated runoff stored in aquifers, lakes, wetlands and reservoirs. Blue water flows are composed of the flux of surface and sub-surface runoff. Green water resources are defined as the infiltrated rainfall in the unsaturated soil layer forming soil moisture that is on its way to evaporate back to the atmosphere. Green water flow is the vapour flux from the terrestrial ecosystems to the atmosphere, which is composed of non-productive green water flow (evaporation) and productive green water flow (plant transpiration), generally combined into the evapotranspiration, ET, i.e., total green water flow.\\n\\nBan Ki-moon, in the above article, suggested that there is no reason that Africa cannot experience a “green revolution” (Ki-moon 2008). The green revolution that lifted large parts of S Asia from an agricultural crisis in the 1960s and 1970s was, however, based on irrigation, i.e. using blue water and fossil fuel driven pumps. In view of the serious environmental impacts of past irrigation, Conway (1997) stressed that a new green revolution has to be green-green, as the boosted agricultural production has to be environmentally sound. The authors of this paper—later supported by the conclusions of the CA—provided evidence to show that not even this is enough. A new food revolution, essentially doubling food productivity on agricultural land in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South and South-east Asia, will have to incorporate a green–green–green revolution, based on managing green water in rainfed agriculture (Rockström et al 2003; Merrey and Sally 2008)—in other words a triply green revolution: green for production increase, green for being green water based, and green in the sense of environmentally sound. The second water related “green” originates from evidence that the conventional strategy to provide water for food production through irrigation will be far from enough; even an optimistic analysis of the potential contribution from blue water to attain the MDGs, indicates that it will contribute less than 20% of the required additional amount (Rockström et al. 2007).\\n\\nAlthough the real problem for food, water, energy and environmental security is how to best manage these resources in combination and how to coordinate their development policies, the food security challenge of the coming decades—the ultimate constraint of future food production—has to be analysed. It is also necessary to provide evidence for strategic opportunities to obtain sustainable water resources for agricultural development. This is critical, given the fact that food production is one of the world’s largest freshwater consuming sectors, and that the process of growing biomass consumes huge volumes of water (an adequate diet consumes in the order of 1,000–1,300 m3/capita/year). In order to get an idea of the future food production problem in terms of scale, regional differences, and need for expanded food trade, it is necessary to analyse the food situation also through a freshwater lens. Therefore, in this paper we analyse water constraints and opportunities for global food production and nutritional value, both fundamental components of food security. We also take into account affordability by linking country income and the emerging need for intercountry exchange through expanded trade in food.\\n\\nIn view of the unprecedented changes in ecosystems caused by past growth in agriculture (CA 2007) and the CA recommendation to concentrate improved water management on existing agricultural land to reduce loss of ecosystem functions and services from terrestrial lands, this paper analyses the potential of improved agricultural production on current croplands (including permanent pasture). It assesses, for the target year 2050, how far improved land and water management on current cropland would go towards global food security, the possible water deficiencies that would remain in water scarce regions aiming at food self-sufficiency, how to meet that water deficit, and the water surplus beyond food water requirements in regions that are better water-endowed, as well as the cropland expansion required in regions where purchasing power is too low to cover the deficit by food imports. We also estimate the proportion of this expansion pressure that will remain unresolved due to absence of accessible virgin land.\\n\\nThe paper thereby presents an integrated socio-ecological analysis of the global food challenge which links the potential to increase food production, focusing on land and water resources through a green-blue analysis, with the social demand for food and the economic capacity for its purchase.\\n\\nMethods\\nThe data underlying this study were generated by the well-established LPJml dynamic global vegetation and water balance model (Gerten et al. 2004), incorporating both population growth and climate change under the economy-oriented SRES A2 emission scenario, involving slow fertility decline. In that scenario, the increasing water shortage over the next few decades is due primarily to increasing population (Rockström et al. 2008).\\n\\nAll calculations in this analysis address the situation projected for 2050 as compared to the situation in 2000, and were made per country for two population scenarios: in addition to the rapid growth scenario just mentioned, taken from the SRES A2 model of the IPCC 4th Assessment (IPCC 2007), calculations are also made for the slower growth scenario of the UN medium population prediction.\\n\\nTo estimate water needs for food per country, dietary water requirements per capita were multiplied by the future population in each country. To produce a food supply, corresponding to the average supply in developing countries as foreseen by FAO (2003) for 2030, would require an average production of 3,000 kcal/capita/day. Assuming that 20% of this is animal protein, an estimated 1,300 m3/capita/year of freshwater would be needed (Rockström et al. 2007); however, with future improvements in water productivity (WP) this food water requirement could probably be reduced to approximately 1,000 m3/capita/year in 2050, thus resulting in lower future water requirements for food production. In the discussion, we will return to the possibilities of also reducing the amount of food wasted “from field to fork”.\\n\\nData on total water availability per country on current croplands (green and blue water) was estimated by Rockström et al. (2008). By comparing water availability with water requirements for food before and after improvements in WP, each country either had a deficit or a surplus of water. All country specific deficits were summed to form a global total. The surpluses were treated analogously.\\n\\nThe water deficits could be met in different ways, first of all by expanding irrigation. The combination of serious streamflow depletion in irrigated regions and environmental flow requirements (Smakhtin et al. 2004) will, however, limit such expansion possibilities. We simply assumed that an additional 15% of the available blue water resource could be used (consumptive water use as evapotranspiration, ET) on irrigated lands in all countries with an irrigation expansion potential according to the FAO (FAOSTAT 2003). However, irrigation expansion was not allowed to exceed the level where a country is classified as chronically water short (<1,000 m3/year of available blue water per capita). Nor was it allowed to exceed the irrigation potential converted to water units, assuming an average of 10,000 m3 consumptive water use per hectare of irrigation area expansion. This resulted in an estimation of additional blue water availability for irrigation, which was allocated towards either reducing the deficit or added to the surplus, depending on the situation in each country.\\n\\nWater consumed on (non-permanent) grazing lands contributes to the amount of water available to meet food water requirements. Two thirds of the total water requirement for food production is used for animal based food items, and around 25% of this comes from grazing globally (Rockström et al. 2007). Based on these figures, an estimate of the water consumed on grazing lands in each country for grazing meat production was made, which in turn was compared with the total green and blue water availability on grazing lands (Rockström et al. 2008), and the lowest value of the two was selected to represent consumptive water use on grazing land for food production. It was assumed that only 50% of the total water availability on permanent grazing lands could be used sustainably in order to safe-guard the generation of other ecosystem services as well. The consumptive water use on grazing lands was subsequently allocated towards reducing the deficit or increasing the surplus of water, depending on the local situation.\\n\\nSummarising the impacts of improvements in WP, irrigation expansion and water contributions from grazing lands, generates either a deficit or a surplus of water in relation to food water requirements in each country. This deficit or surplus can be met either by trade or by horizontal expansion, i.e., by converting other terrestrial ecosystems to crop land. To analyse the potential for trade, each country was classified according to their gross national income (GNI) in 2005 (World Bank 2005) in three different classes: low, middle and high income countries (World Bank 2008). Based on cereal import and GNI data, it was assumed that there is a positive relationship between import potential and GNI (FAOStat 2003; World Bank statistics 2005). Thereafter, countries were categorized according to their hydro-climatic (deficit or surplus water resources) and socio-economic (trade or expansion) factors.\\n\\nIt was assumed that the low income countries facing difficulties in meeting water requirements, will not be able to rely on trade in the future, and will thus have to expand agriculture horizontally. The expansion is expected to be done in two steps: first into present grazing lands, by allocating the total remaining unallocated green and blue water availability on grazing lands towards food production (the share that has not already been appropriated for grazing in meat production), and then secondly by expanding into other lands. This latter expansion was translated into land area requirements based on figures from Rockström et al. (2008). An estimate was also made of potential water saving by reducing losses in the food chain, from field to consumption.\\n\\nResults\\nWater deficit countries\\nIn a first step, the available green water resource on current cropland area is estimated at country level. We focus the analysis on the potential to meet food water requirements on current crop land in order to assess the possibility of avoiding cropland expansion at the expense of further ecosystem degradation. When the available green water resource is too small to meet national food water requirements, blue water may be added to the cropland by irrigation. As pointed out in Methods, we have limited the additional irrigation potential to a 15% increase. This is in order to account for the limited opportunities to increase blue water withdrawals from rivers, lakes and aquifers, without unacceptable decline of aquatic ecosystem functions and services.\\n\\nConventionally, water scarcity analyses are based on comparing only blue water availability with future water for food demands. These analyses generally result in very high estimates of the proportion of people and number of countries subject to water scarcity, as they assume that blue water is the only freshwater resource contributing to food production. The reality is very different, with an estimated 5,000 km3/year of consumptive water use originating from green water in rainfed agriculture, and “only” approximately 2,000 km3/year from blue water consumption in irrigated agriculture. These “blue” water analyses obviously exaggerate the global water problem, and at the same time under-estimates the potential to produce food in regions that are blue water scarce (but that may be rich in green water resources—such as in savannah regions of the world). As pointed out earlier by the authors (Falkenmark and Rockström 2004), such analyses are therefore flawed, and require a broadened green-blue analysis. Such an analysis is shown in Fig. 1, which illustrates in green the number of countries in 2050 facing freshwater (green + blue) surpluses (>1,300 m3/cap/year in water for food availability over current agricultural land) and in orange/red countries facing freshwater deficits (<1,300 m3/cap/year). This map reveals a broad zone of water deficit countries all the way from Morocco in the west to India in the east (countries which are normally also assessed as water stressed in blue-water analyses). Countries close to deficit are highlighted in yellow where there is a green plus blue availability of only 1,700 m3/cap/year—a limit frequently used in blue water scarcity analyses (cf. correlation between food trade and blue water shortage, Yang et al. 2003). In this perspective China and a few sub-Saharan countries also emerge as approaching a critical situation.\\n\\nFig. 1\\nfigure 1\\nCountries colour coded according to water availability for food self-sufficiency. Those with <1,300 m3/capita/year are in deficit. See text for details. From Rockström et al. 2008\\n\\nFull size image\\nCountry-level water deficiencies and surpluses\\nThe cumulative country-based food water requirements by 2050 amounts to approximately 14,200 km3/year for the SRES-A2 population projection and to 11,900 km3/year for the UN medium projection. The total green water availability by 2050 on current croplands was estimated at 6,260 km3/year, to which was added a blue water irrigation contribution of an estimated 1,820 km3/year. This gives a total water availability (blue plus green) of 8,085 km3/year. The difference between the cumulative requirements of 14,200 or 11,900 km3/year and the total green plus blue availability of 8,085 km3/year results in a global water deficit by 2050 of 6,130 or 3,800 km3/year.\\n\\nSumming up water availability, country by country, gives higher values as surpluses and deficits between countries no longer compensate each other. This results in a country-based water deficit in 2050 of 7,500 or 5,510 km3/year and a surplus of 1,380 or 1,710 km3/year.\\n\\nThis analysis shows that concerns for future food production constraints are clearly well founded even when taking a broader green-blue water approach, although such analysis reduces the water deficit as compared to a “blue water only” analysis. The next question is: what options are there to meet these massive water deficits? We will start by analysing the potential contributions from\\n\\nwater productivity improvements\\n\\nirrigation expansion\\n\\ncontribution from grazing on permanent pasture lands\\n\\nWater productivity improvements and irrigation expansion\\nImproving water productivity for food production greatly reduces the deficit by about 2,000–3,000 km3/year, while increasing the surplus in water rich countries by about 450–550 km3/year, depending on population scenario (Table 1). Irrigation expansion further reduces the deficit by 400–600 km3/year. In relation to improvements in water productivity, the figure is small, which is due to the fact that in many countries experiencing a total water deficit for the production of food, the blue water availability is already limiting and irrigation expansion is thus not feasible. Irrigation expansion in surplus countries added some 1,100–1,300 km3/year. This vast amount includes an exceptionally large increase in a few countries with large rivers, such as Brazil.\\n\\nTable 1 Country based estimates of water deficits and surpluses for food production in 2050\\nFull size table\\nGrazing fodder contribution\\nAll animal protein does not originate from cattle fed on feed from croplands. A portion of animal protein is produced from grazed fodder. We estimate that water consumed on non-permanent grazing lands for meat production may result in a reduction of 700–900 km3/year in water requirements for food production in water deficit countries, while increasing the surplus of water availability in water rich countries by 400–500 km3/year. These are rather conservative estimates on the contribution of water from grazing lands, due to the uncertainty related to upholding the generation of ecosystem services and maintaining resilience in these ecosystems. However, the overall improvement in water productivity indirectly assumes that livestock water productivity of grazing meat production is also improved.\\n\\nFood trade to compensate the remaining net water deficit\\nA remaining net deficit of some 2,200–3,300 km3/year (Table 1) in water short countries could theoretically be met by food imports from water rich countries, since the surplus in the latter category of 3,400–4,000 km3/year exceeds the deficit. However, the question is will poor countries be able to afford the required imports of food? The classification of countries into those with low, medium and high incomes reveals that more than half of the deficit is located in low income countries, while the majority of the surplus is found in medium income countries (Table 2). Even when assuming the less pessimistic UN medium projection of population growth and a feasible improvement of water productivity, there will remain a water deficit of some 2,200 km3/year in water short countries, making them dependent on either food import or, alternatively, on cropland expansion. With the assumption made regarding purchasing power—that countries with an GNI below 1,000 US$/capita/year will not have enough purchasing power to import their food—it will be difficult for these countries to avoid a cropland expansion into other land of the order of some 300 Mha. This expansion can be compared with earlier assessments. The senior authors in a study of 92 developing countries arrived at the somewhat larger figure of 450 Mha, part of which would be covered if food import continued at the present level (Rockström et al. 2007).\\n\\nTable 2 Country level water deficits and surpluses for food self-sufficiency (km3/year) and populations involved in millions of people (Mp): SRES A2 and UN medium population scenarios\\nFull size table\\nIn 2050 it is estimated that of the order of one third of the world’s population will live in each of the three regions: those that export, those that import and those that have to expand their croplands. This means that an estimated 3.8–4.2 billion people will live in regions which cannot produce enough food on current croplands, and where the import potential may be limited by weak national level wealth (as seen from the income situation 2005).\\n\\nGlobally, the water deficit countries are distributed mainly in the tropical zone, while the countries experiencing a surplus of water are located in the temperate region (Fig. 2). Countries which might be forced to expand agriculture horizontally at the expense of other ecosystems are found in Africa and S Asia, predominantly in the Savannah zone.\\n\\nFig. 2\\nfigure 2\\nFood importing and exporting countries from a water availability perspective in 2050, including low-income, water short countries which most likely will have to rely on horizontal expansion of agriculture\\n\\nFull size image\\nCropland expansion—the remaining option\\nParts of the horizontal expansion in the low income countries with a water deficit could be met by utilizing the total water availability on current grazing lands specifically for food production. Countries with large grazing lands will be able to contribute considerable amounts of water if used for crop production. The contributions are especially large (beyond 20 km3/year) in Brazil, Philippines, Zaire, US and Mexico. This entails converting grazing lands to crop land, assuming a higher level of food output per unit land (e.g., converting grazing lands generating in the order of 1–2 tons of grazing dry matter per hectare, to grain yields in the order of 2–3 tons per ha). This will result in higher water consumption per unit area though, potentially reducing blue water generation and water availability for other ecological functions and biodiversity.\\n\\nWe have also tried to analyse how much of the cropland expansion that will remain unresolved (Table 3). The remaining deficit, after considering the option of converting grazing lands to crop land, is 1,000–1,300 km3/year. This corresponds to 200–300 Mha of virgin lands that would have to be converted to agricultural lands in order to meet food water requirements.\\n\\nTable 3 Cropland expansion required by 2050\\nFull size table\\nThis expansion can be compared with earlier assessments. In a recent analysis of 92 developing countries, we arrived at the somewhat larger estimate of expansion requirement of 450 Mha, out of which a part would be covered if food imports were continued at the present level (Rockström et al 2007).\\n\\nThe general picture which emerges is that most of the developing countries in Africa and Asia will be dependent on either large-scale food imports, or in case of the lowest income category of these countries, on horizontal expansion of their croplands. In Africa, the latter group includes Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Malawi, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Togo and Uganda; and in Asia, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, N Korea, Pakistan and Yemen. No attention however, has been paid to whether horizontal cropland expansion beyond pastures will be possible.\\n\\nGrazing land can only cover less than one third of the needed cropland expansion, most of which will have to incorporate other land, i.e. grasslands and forests. Most of this expansion will take place in Africa, where there is large potential but a set of Asian countries also belong to this group. The largest expansion needs may be expected in India (72 Mha), Pakistan (27 Mha) and Bangladesh (23 Mha). In this region, the potential, however, is very low—most arable land is already in use. This leads to the conclusion that these countries are approaching the end of the road unless income growth in the meantime allows them to import the food required. They could therefore constitute a fourth category of country with a population of altogether 2.4 billion, unable to secure food supply at the required calorie level. Also Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia belong to this fourth particularly vulnerable group where income rise will be especially critical for hunger eradication. The “overpopulation” of these countries in the sense that the population cannot be fed if other lands are not accessible for cropland expansion amounts to some 650 millions.\\n\\nDiscussion\\nIn this paper we analyse the world food challenge from a freshwater perspective. We combine this with an additional boundary condition for agricultural production in the future, namely to secure ecological resilience in agricultural landscapes, particularly biological diversity, by emphasizing the need to avoid continued expansion of cropland beyond grazing land.\\n\\nAs a first step, the analysis shows that the world will not, by 2050, have exceeded its carrying capacity—despite escalated food demand—as seen from a water-constrained food production perspective. The net water deficit is estimated to be 2,200 km3/year in countries facing water scarcity (3,270 in the A2 population scenario), but there will be a net surplus of an estimated 3,960 km3/year (3,440 in the A2 population scenario) to cover it in water rich countries.\\n\\nWater deficit implications\\nThe group of water deficit countries that will be relying on import to feed their populations by 2050 encompasses the chronically water short countries in N Africa, W, S and E Asia. Also belonging to this group are industrial countries such as Japan and a set of European countries that are overpopulated in relation to their cropland areas, including Italy and Germany. Food exporting countries will be located in N America, C America, the former Soviet region, southern African countries and some European countries with plenty of cropland area and surplus freshwater resources.\\n\\nThe result of this analysis is sometimes counter-intuitive. Namibia and Botswana, both extremely water short countries, have water availability—mainly as green water—beyond what will be needed to be food-self sufficient. This is the result of taking a green-blue water perspective and indicates the potential of increasing food production even further by adopting green water management practices, such as conservation tillage, mulch farming, water harvesting and soil and water conservation practices. As shown from agricultural trials, yield levels of maize can in fact be more than doubled in Botswana, by adopting such practices (SIWI 2001).\\n\\nUncertainties\\nHowever, there are many uncertainties both within the analysis as such and the social-ecological driving forces not considered here. The study is model-based, using best available data and is, as a consequence, no better than the limitations following from, on the one hand, data uncertainties and, on the other, the model itself. It has therefore to be seen as mainly indicative only. One consequence is the uncertainty of blue water availability in arid climate zones where the model’s neglect of natural blue water evaporation tends to exaggerate this availability (Gerten et al. 2004).\\n\\nIn reality, also many other constraints exist. We address water impacts induced by climate change using one scenario. There are though huge uncertainties regarding water resource implications of climate change over the coming 50 years. Furthermore, we do not address, in an explicit way, constraints related to climate variability on the farmers’ fields, i.e., droughts, dry spells, and floods. In the same way, we do not in any explicit way address constraints related to soils. However, we do address both these factors (water variability, soil and crop related constraints) through our water productivity analysis (see below).\\n\\nImportantly, the analysis is static with regards to assumptions on economic growth in the future. Obviously, it is a pessimistic assumption that the countries today classified as unable to substitute own food production with large-scale imports of food, will remain in this predicament also in 2050. A weakness in this analysis is that we assume the current level of income distribution among the countries in the world to remain the same as today in our 2050 scenario. Obviously, the countries that we estimate will be forced to expand agricultural land (they have neither the water resources on current agricultural land, nor the purchasing power to substitute production for imports) may follow a better economic growth trajectory in the future than in the past. The dynamics of regional economic growth may change the wealth distribution in the world, and thereby shift the flows of food on the Planet. However, food trade today accounts for only a small part of food provision (only 15% of staple food consumption is traded and this is imported to a significant degree by rich, arid countries). Most developing countries continue to prioritize food ', 'unique_identifier': 2}\n",

Effective management of water for crop production in water scarce areas requires efficient approaches. Increasing crop water productivity (WP) and drought tolerance by genetic improvement and physiological regulation may be the means to achieve efficient and effective use of water. But only high water productivity values carry little or no interest if they are not associated with high or acceptable yields. Such association of high (or moderate) productivity values with high (or moderate) yields has important implications on the effective use of water. In this paper we discussed the factors affecting water productivity, and the possible techniques to improve water productivity. A single approach would not be able to tackle the forthcoming challenge of producing more food and fiber with limited or even reduced available water. Combining biological water-saving measures with engineering solutions (water saving irrigation method, deficit irrigation, proper deficit sequencing, modernization of irrigation system, etc.), and agronomic and soil manipulation (seed priming, seedling age manipulation, direct- or wet-seeded rice, proper crop choice, integrating agriculture and aquaculture, increasing soil fertility, addition of organic matter, tillage and soil mulching, etc.) may solve the problem to a certain extent. New scientific information is needed to improve the economic gains of WP because the future improvements in WP seem to be limited by economic rather than a lack of technological means.\\n\\nPrevious article in issueNext article in issue\\nKeywords\\nWater scarcityDeficit sequencingAssimilate partitioningSeed primingSeedling age manipulationWater productivityCrop production\\n1. Introduction\\nToday's world population of 6000 million is expected to reach about 8100 million by 2030, an increase of 35%. The growing population will result in considerable additional demand for food. Simultaneously, water demand from non-agricultural sectors will keep growing in both developed and developing countries. About 40% of the land in the world is under arid and semi-arid climatic conditions (Gamo, 1999). Efficient use of rainwater and optimization of crop water productivity (WP) are important in such conditions.\\n\\nAn FAO analysis (FAO, 2003) of 93 developing countries expects increase of agricultural production over the period 1998–2030 by 49% in rain fed and by 81% in irrigated regions. Therefore, much of the additional food production is expected to come from irrigated land, three quarters of which are located in developing countries. In developing countries, the irrigated area in 1998 has nearly doubled than that in 1962. FAO estimates that the irrigated area in the selected 93 developing countries will only grow by 23% over the 1998–2030 periods. However, the effective harvested irrigated area (considering the increase in cropping intensity) is expected to increase by 34%. This means that more area needs to be brought under irrigation to produce more crops with the present available water resources.\\n\\nIn the dry areas, water, not land, is the most limiting resource for improving agricultural production. Maximization of yield per unit of water (water productivity), and not yield per unit of land (land productivity), is therefore a better strategy for dry farming systems. Under such conditions, more efficient water management techniques must be adopted. Water deficiency and low availability of nutrient often limit crop growth and production potential in agro-ecosystems because most crops are sensitive to water and nutrient deficits during different critical stages. On the other hand, excessive use of water can increase the production cost and pollute the environment (enhancing fertilizer leaching). So enhancement of water productivity (also termed as water use efficiency) in agriculture is very important. It is widely believed that an increase in agricultural water productivity is the key approach to mitigate water shortage and to reduce environmental problems.\\n\\nThis paper therefore discussed the factors that may affect actual water productivity in irrigated and dry-land agriculture and highlighted the measures or possible ways to improve water productivity.\\n\\n2. Concepts and scale considerations of water productivity\\n‘Water productivity’ may carry different meanings to different people, and may differ between but also within groups of water users (Kijne et al., 2003, Tuong et al., 2005, Zoebl, 2006, Playan and Mateos, 2006, Dugan et al., 2006, Wesseling and Feddes, 2006). It can be defined with respect to different water-using production sectors (e.g. crop production, fishery, forestry, domestic and industrial use) (Igbadun et al., 2006) as the amount of output produced per unit of water involved in the production, or the value added to water in a given circumstance. To a hydrologist, it means the ratio of the volume of water used productively, i.e., transpired and in some cases also evaporated, from the area under study, to the volume of water potentially available for that purpose. In fisheries, it might mean the ratio of fish produced to the volume of water used. To an economist, it might mean the monetary value of output divided by that of the necessary water input. To an irrigation engineer, it might mean the ratio of the amount or the value of crops produced in a farm (or catchment) to the supplied water. Even a crop scientist can use WP in different aspects: leaf WP (leaf photosynthetic rate per transpiration rate), whole plant WP (the ratio of aboveground biomass or dry matter per unit area to water use), yield WP (crop grain per unit area to transpiration) (Hong-Xing et al., 2007). In essence, WP represents the output of a given activity to the water input. Where there is inter-cropping or multiple culture (crop + fish), monetary return per unit of water input is the best option.\\n\\nIn agriculture, we are interested to produce more with less water because water is a limiting factor in many parts of the world. Water is an economic good, because we have to pay for it, and in many cases we also have to pay enormous environmental costs.\\n\\nWater productivity is a useful indicator for quantifying the impact of irrigation scheduling decisions with regard to water management. It is also a basis for virtual water through the trade of food both at the international and intra-national level (Liu et al., 2007).\\n\\nIn crop production system, water productivity (WP) is used to define the relationship between crop produced and the amount of water involved in crop production, expressed as crop production per unit volume of water. Crop production may be expressed in terms of total dry-matter yield or seed (or grain) yield (kg) or, when dealing with different crops, yield may be transformed into monetary units (i.e. US $). More options are available to define the volume of water. Different water productivity indicators result from different options:\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n(3)\\nIf the effectiveness of water use in a single crop is described, Eqs. (1) or (2) is a good indicator. If regions are compared, or the effectiveness of water use in multiple cultures or under limiting water condition (without limiting land) (Ali et al., 2007) is studied, Eq. (3) is more appropriate.\\n\\nFor discussion and interpretation, Eq. (1) has been considered in this paper which has further distinguished in irrigation water productivity (IWP) and water productivity (EWP):\\n(4)\\n(5)\\nIn case of crop production, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) is used by the plant as the energy in the photosynthesis process to convert CO2 into biomass using the water transpired by the plant. Obviously, evaporation from soil or water surfaces in between plants is definitely not a function of crop production. Thus, actually yield is a function of crop transpiration. Since independent measurement of evaporation and transpiration is hard and requires specific equipment and expertise, evapotranspiration (ET) is normally used instead of transpiration.\\n\\n3. Factors affecting WP\\nThe factors which affect or influence crop yield (numerator of the productivity equation), and water applied or need to be applied (denominator of the same equation), obviously influence the water productivity. The factors are:\\n\\n3.1. Crop cultivar type\\nPlants unavoidably lose a large quantity of water when they open their stomata for CO2 uptake in an unsaturated air. Vapor diffuses out from the sub-stomatal cavity into the air while CO2 goes in the opposite way. Mathematical modeling of these two opposing diffusion processes has shown that WP is largely a function of the CO2 and vapor concentration gradients between the inside and outside of the leaf (Jones, 1992). These two opposing fluxes are regulated by stomata. Therefore, the stomatal behavior will determine the WP of a particular species or cultivar. It is well known that C4 plants have higher WP than C3 plants. Within C3 plants, many reports have shown that genotypes can be selected for higher WP according to their carbon isotope discrimination, a function of the CO2 concentration gradient between the inside and outside of the leaf (e.g. Craufurd et al., 1991, Ehdaie et al., 1991).\\n\\n3.2. Applied water\\nIn agriculture, many ways of conserving water have been investigated and techniques such as partial irrigation, deficit irrigation or drip irrigation have shown that WP can be enhanced (Ali et al., 1997, Ali et al., 2007, Jalota et al., 2006, Zhang et al., 2004, Oweis et al., 2000, Oweis et al., 1998, Talukder et al., 1987, Talukder et al., 1999, Oweis, 1997). In general, these techniques are a trade-off: a lower yield for a higher WP. Then the question arises if it is possible to increase WP without a significant yield reduction. There are many examples where grain yield, a large proportion of the total biomass, shows a negative parabolic relationship with the amount of irrigation. This suggests that when water supply is sufficient, excessive vegetative growth may lead to less root activity, unhealthy canopy structure and a lower harvest index or harvest ratio (ratio of seed yield to straw yield). That means that high biomass production, supported by high water supply, will not lead to high WP if defined as the grain production per unit amount of water irrigated. Therefore, the goal is to increase WP of grain yield by limiting water supply to increase harvest index or harvest ratio. Recent research has shown that in some irrigated situations, grain yield can be improved while reducing the amount of water applied to the crop (Yang et al., 2000, Yang et al., 2001, Yang et al., 2002), mainly via improved harvest index which has been shown as a key component to improve WP (Ehdaie and Waines, 1993).\\n\\nUnder water deficit condition, photosynthesis responds variably under different patterns and rates of drought. During gradual soil drying condition, crops exhibit higher photosynthetic rate than under fast soil drying condition. In the former, osmotic adjustment increases to a certain extent while in the latter it remains constant. Osmotic adjustment allows for maintenance of photosynthesis and growth by stomatal and photosynthetic adaptation (Turner, 1986).\\n\\nWater deficit or drought stress during cereal grain development reduces the duration of grain filling. If the rate of grain filling is not adjusted upward, final grain weight is reduced. Increased grain growth rate under drought stress depends on the supply of assimilates. An alternative source of assimilates are pre-anthesis stem reserves in the form of sugars, starch or fructose, depending on the species. These reserves are readily utilized for grain filling and their availability may become a critical factor in sustaining grain filling and grain yield under drought stress.\\n\\n3.3. Remobilization of pre-stored carbon, the variable fraction in grain filling\\nGrain filling is the final stage of growth in cereals where fertilized ovaries develop into caryopses. At this stage, about 40–50% of total biomass is deposited into the grains. Delayed whole plant senescence, leading to poorly filled grains and unused carbohydrate in straws, is a new problem increasingly recognized in rice and wheat production in recent years (Zhang et al., 1998). Slow grain filling may often be associated with delayed whole plant senescence. Monocarpic plants such as rice and wheat need the initiation of the whole plant senescence so that stored carbohydrates in stems and leaf sheaths can be remobilized and transferred to developing grains (Zhang and Yang, 2004). Normally when these crops are grown in high-input system, pre-stored carbohydrates contributes 25–33% to the final weight of grain.\\n\\n3.4. Soil factor\\nEvaporative loss of water from the soil surface plays a significant role on plant growth during germination and seedling establishment, and also during other growth periods. Soil texture and organic matter content determine the water storage and release properties. Rapid drying of soil does not provide opportunity for osmotic regulation and adjustment, and thus affects yield and water productivity. Nutritional status of the young crop, especially nitrogen, can markedly affect the rate of development of leaf area and hence evaporation losses from the soil. Organic matter in soil interacts with other nutrients and microbial activities.\\n\\n3.5. Agronomic factor\\nAgronomic factors which can affect WP are timeliness of sowing, evenness of establishment, use of herbicides, and the role of previous crop. Water productivity depends not only on how the crop is managed during its life, but also on how it is fitted into the management of a farm, both in space and time (Ali et al., 2005). By better tuning both the vegetative and floriferous development of a crop, optimal timing of harvest can be ensured; and thus, tactical advantage of variable weather can be taken by sowing the next crop at the right time, and facilitating good establishment. Any husbandry technique that facilitates rapid development and enables the crop to cover soil surface, shade out weeds, and reduce wind speed may, in most circumstances, increase crop competitiveness and WP (Cooper and Gregory, 1987). Practices that particularly contribute to these factors are early sowing, selection of varieties with early growth (under cool condition), adequate fertilization, adequate plant population and close spacing (Gregory, 1991, Harris et al., 1991). Within the concept of improved WP, water transpired by crops should be increased relative to evaporation from the soil surface. Soil and stubble management may influence the water balance of the soil by affecting infiltration and water storage in the soil, and evaporation losses from the soil surface. These combined effects can also substantially affect the amount of water available to a crop. Runoff during intense rainfall can be greatly reduced by a good mulch cover. Mulch cover and organic matter impact on plant response in terms of increased plant growth or yield, and offer opportunities to improve water productivity.\\n\\nRapid development of ground cover relies on good seedling establishment. Crusting of the surface of soils with poor structure, uneven sowing depth, and poor quality seed can all lead to large gaps in plant cover. Leaf growth of seedlings is strongly affected by temperature of both air and soil. So, sowing winter-growing crops early, when soil and air are still warm, leads to good canopy cover during late autumn and winter with less evaporative losses from the soil surface.\\n\\n3.6. Economic factors\\nEconomic factors may influence the optimum level of WP. Sometimes large additional costs are involved in increasing WP, for example, the investment in sprinkler, drip or hose pipe irrigation systems. These systems include the fixed and operational costs of changing the irrigation system. The returns may include water saved plus the increased crop production (if any). Lining of irrigation channel also involves a considerable amount of fixed cost, which may not be bearable by the farmers, specially in third world countries.\\n\\nThe adaptability of any cropping pattern depends on its profitability. The farmers respond to market rules searching for the highest return per unit of land or water, depending on the relative scarcity of both resources.\\n\\n4. Techniques to improve WP\\nThe term ‘increasing or improving water productivity’ implies how we can most effectively improve the outcome or yield of a crop with the water currently in use. The answer lies in three main pathways (Passioura, 2006): (i) transpire most of the supplied water (minimization of unwanted loss), (ii) exchange transpired water for CO2 more effectively in producing biomass, and (iii) convert most of the biomass into grain or other form of harvestable product.\\n\\nMany technologies to improve WP and the management of scarce water resources are available. Among the most promising and efficient proven techniques are: (i) limited supplemental irrigation for optimizing the use of the limited water and (ii) water harvesting for improved farm income in drier environment. Improving crop water productivity, however, requires exploiting not only water management but also other inputs such as improved cultivars, fertility management and cultural practices which influence yield.\\n\\n4.1. Deficit irrigation\\nLimited irrigation or deficit irrigation, if applied during critical crop growth stages, results in substantial improvement in yield and water productivity. There are different ways to manage deficit irrigation. The irrigator can reduce the irrigation depth, refill only part of the root zone, reduce the irrigation frequency by increasing the interval between successive irrigations, refill a fraction of the soil water capacity of the root zone, wetting furrows alternately or placing them further apart.\\n\\nResearch at the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) (Zhang and Oweis, 1999) has shown that application of only 50% of full supplemental irrigation (SI) requirements causes a yield reduction of only 10–15%. Assuming that under limited water resource only 50% of the full irrigation required by the farm would be available (i.e., 4440 m3 for a 4 ha field), Zhang and Oweis (1999) compared the deficit irrigation with other options. They showed that a farmer with 4 ha would, on average, produce 33% more grain if deficit irrigation was applied over the whole area compared to full irrigation over part of the area. The deficit irrigation increased the benefit with more than 50% compared with that of farmers’ usual practice of over-irrigation.\\n\\nThe association of high WP values with high yields has important implications on the crop management for achieving efficient use of water resources in water scarce areas (Oweis et al., 1998). The nature of yield versus irrigation water (IR) or ET, and irrigation water productivity (IWP) or WP versus IR or ET (Fig. 1, Fig. 2) curves clarify the importance of attaining relatively higher yields with higher water productivity. Attaining higher yields with increased WP is only economical when the increased gains in crop yield are not offset by increased costs of other inputs. Policies for maximizing yield should be considered carefully before being applied under water scarce conditions. Guidelines for recommending irrigation schedules under normal water availability (Allen et al., 1998) may need to be revised when applied in water scarce areas.\\n\\n\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 1. Trend of irrigation water versus yield, and irrigation water versus irrigation water productivity (IWP) (after Ali, 2006).\\n\\n\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 2. Trend of evapotranspiration (ET) versus yield, and ET versus water productivity (WP) (after Ali, 2006).\\n\\nIn rice cultivation, instead of maintaining 3–5 cm standing water in the field, application of irrigation after 3–4 days of disappearance of ponded water (irrigation is applied until 5 cm of water is ponded, permit to disappear the ponded water, wait 3–4 days from the day of disappearance, and then field is irrigated again with 5 cm of water) (also termed as alternate wetting (ponding) and drying (to field capacity)) leads to 20–30% water saving without significant yield reduction (Sandhu et al., 1980, Pandey et al., 1989, Sarkar et al., 2002). Such practices certainly increase IWP. Deficit irrigation facilitates in using applied and stored (within root zone) water more efficiently, and increases WP (Ali et al., 2007).\\n\\n4.2. Proper sequencing of water deficit\\nOptimal sequencing of water deficit reduces the detrimental effect on yield, and hence increases WP (Ali et al., 2004, Ali et al., 2007, Liang et al., 2002, Singh, 1981). Liang et al. (2002) demonstrated that the drying-rewatering alternation (alternate deficit) had a significant compensatory effect that could reduce transpiration and keep wheat growing, and significantly increased WP. Ali et al. (2007) obtained highest WP and IWP in alternate deficit treatments (reasonable yield of 3.4 t/ha with 2 irrigation; in contrast to 3.8 t/ha in well irrigated treatments) where deficits were imposed initially at jointing-shooting and then at flowering-soft dough stages of the growth period. Singh (1981) found that without prior ET deficit in the vegetative stage, wheat yields were sensitive to water deficit during the critical booting/heading period but they were relatively insensitive when the plants were conditioned to some 15% moisture stress in the vegetative stage. Thus, the experimental findings revealed that a certain amount of water deficit should be spread out over the whole growth period with alternate wetting and drying. When plants are subjected gradually to water stress, hardening processes take place which make plants less sensitive to renewed water stress by osmotic adjustment of the leaves, by influencing leaf morphology and change in the elastic modulus of leaf cells. Osmotic adjustment allows for the maintenance of photosynthesis and growth by stomatal and photosynthetic adjustment (Turner, 2004).\\n\\n4.3. Surge irrigation management in vertisol\\nSurge irrigation, the application of irrigation water in a series of pulses, rather than the conventional continuous flow system of furrow irrigation, has been proposed as a measure of improving the WP of surface irrigation methods (Stringham, 1988). The principle behind the technique is that, non-continuous application achieves optimum moisture conditions in vertisols with less soil aggregate breakdown, thereby facilitating infiltration into the soil profile. Mintesinot et al. (2007) compared traditional irrigation management (without scheduling) and surge/intermittent irrigation (with scheduling) on a vertisol in Ethiopia using maize as an indicator crop. They found that surge irrigation resulted in a yield of 2.3 times that of traditional irrigation, and the WP and income using surge management were 2.7 and 2.8 times that of traditional management. Horst et al. (2007) concluded that surge flow on alternate furrows was the best technique for water saving and increased WP in cotton.\\n\\n4.4. Increasing soil fertility\\nIn many dry-area soils having inherent low fertility, judicious use of fertilizer is particularly important. Liu et al. (1998) indicated that maximum yield and the highest WP could be achieved under the optimum fertilizer input in the semi-arid field conditions of the hilly loess area in Ningxia, China. They found that increased soil fertility was positively correlated with grain yield and WP of spring wheat, with a correlation coefficient of 0.96 and 0.86, respectively. The fertilizer improved the extension of the root system. The ameliorated root system was able to improve crop water use and nutrient absorption and hence, crop yield and WP were increased. Their study highlighted the effects of improved nutrition on the efficient use of limited water in dry land wheat production. Deng et al. (2003) demonstrated that the contribution of nutrients can improve WP and biological water saving.\\n\\nIn some soil, nitrogen up to 100 kg N per ha is effective, after which no benefits were obtained. This rate of N greatly improves WP. It is also important that there is adequate available phosphorus (P) in the soil so that response to N and applied irrigation is not constrained (Ryan, 2000). Hatfield et al. (2001) showed that the addition of N and P have an indirect effect on water use through the physiological efficiency of the plant.\\n\\n4.5. Improving assimilate partitioning to grain (by increasing harvest index and harvest ratio)\\nIn most crops (especially in cereals), we are interested to produce higher grain yield, but not the straw yield. Harvest index has been shown as a variable factor in crop production, especially in cases where the whole plant senescence (rice and wheat) is unfavorably delayed. Such delayed senescence can delay the remobilization of pre-stored carbon reserves in the straw and results in lower harvest index. Controlled soil drying can enhance the whole plant senescence and, therefore, improves the remobilization of pre-stored carbon reserve. Gains from the improved harvest index may outweigh any possible biomass loss due to shortened photosynthetic period in grain filling. The early senescence induced by water deficit does not necessarily reduce grain yield even when plants are grown under normal N conditions (Yang et al., 2001).\\n\\nZhang et al. (1998) found in field grown wheat that a soil drying during the grain filling period enhance early senescence. They found that while the grain filling was shortened by 10 days (from 41 to 31 days) in unwatered (during this period) plots, a faster rate of grain-filling and enhanced mobilization of stored carbohydrate minimized the effect on yield. Zhang and Yang (2004) showed that WP may be enhanced through an improved harvest index (HI). Ali (2006) found the highest HI, harvest ratio and IWP with alternate deficit treatment, having water shortage during the grain filling stage.\\n\\n4.6. Manipulation of seedling age\\nIn transplanted rice, seedlings of 25–45 days old are normally used. Recent research results showed that 55–65 days old seedlings can be used for the Boro (Kharif) season (BINA, 2005). Higher fertile tiller/hill, filled grain, and 1000 seed weight contribute to higher grain yield in such case. The older seedling (55–65 days) could reduce crop duration up to 15 days. That means that total crop duration in the field (from transplanting to maturity) can be reduced by 30 days (15 days late transplanting +15 days early maturing), which obviously reduces the crop water requirement, and increases water productivity. Ali et al. (1992) obtained the highest yield with 60 days old seedling for the Aman (monsoon) season. Singh and Sharma (1993), and Paul (1994) observed insignificant yield difference for 30–60 days old seedling of monsoon rice.\\n\\n4.7. Wet-seeded or direct-seeded rice\\nThe wet-seeded or direct-seeded technique is an alternative to the transplanting method of rice crop establishment. This technique increases crop yield and water productivity (BRRI, 1996, Tabbal et al., 2000, Mazid et al., 2000).\\n\\n4.8. Priming or soaking of seed\\nThe technique of seed priming (i.e. soaking seeds in water for a specific period (usually overnight), then surface dried and then sown has been shown to improve plant stands and provide benefits in terms of earlier maturity and increased seed yield for a range of crops (wheat, maize, lentil, chickpea, etc.) in rainfed as well as irrigated crops grown on normal soils (Ali, 2004, Rashid et al., 2002, Rao and Phillips, 1993, Ponnuswamy and Karivaratharaju, 1993). This technique reduces the pre- or post-sowing irrigation needs, saves water and increases the water productivity. Kahlon et al. (1992) observed that soaking wheat for 24 or 48 h in water or pre-germinating seed sowing increased grain yield with 10.3, 16.3 and 21.2%, respectively, compared to untreated seed sowing.\\n\\n4.9. Application of organic matter, farmyard manure and biofertilizer\\nNitrogen management is one of the major factors to attain higher crop productivity (which in turn increase WP) in dry-land farming, particularly under limited water supply, where the use of higher dose of inorganic fertilizer is restricted. Under such condition, organic sources of nitrogenous fertilizer such as farmyard manure and bio-fertilizer are more appropriate (Sushila and Giri, 2000, Azad et al., 1998). A legume-based cropping system can enhance the fertility status through addition of atmospheric nitrogen.\\n\\nIncreasing the organic matter (OM) of soil has long been recognized as an effective way of improving their physical and chemical conditions, and water-holding capacity. Increase of OM content of fine-textured soil does not increase the available water-storage capacity as much as it does for sandy soils; but the benefits result from improved structure, which decreases crusting and surface sealing, permits greater infiltration, and increases root proliferation throughout the soil profile. The OM also results in more efficient water use, releases water slowly, facilitating proper crop growth and thus increases yield and water productivity (Kumar and Wadood, 1995, Mbagwu, 1992, Piccolo et al., 1996, Mapa et al., 1994, Leinweber et al., 1993).\\n\\n4.10. Tillage and sub-soiling\\nIncreasing water storage within the soil profile is necessary to increase plant available soil water. Tillage roughens the soil surface and breaks any soil crust. This leads to increased water storage by increased infiltration. Musick et al. (1994) found that wheat yield was positively and linearly related to soil water stored at planting and this relationship was more significant than that to seasonal water use.\\n\\nActive deep roots help to reduce drainage losses and abstract soil water. But in most cases, the sub-soils are not suitable for root extension or inhibit root extension due to a hard layer (often called plough pan). Sub-soiling or deep tillage facilitate root expansion and soil moisture abstraction. Normally, the roots do access sub-soil at the mid- or late-season, after the anthesis, when the products of the photosynthesis go almost entirely towards the grain filling (with little respiratory or other losses). Thus, a minor gain in photosynthetic activity at this stage contributes to an accelerated rate of grain yield.\\n\\n4.11. Other management factors\\nAmong the management factors for more productive farming systems are the use of improved or suitable crop rotation, sowing dates, crop density, mulching, weed control, pests and disease control, water conservation measures (Pala and Studer, 1999), raised bed planting and the role of previous crops. Chahal et al. (2007) observed that with the shifting of transplanting dates of rice at Punjab, India, from higher (mid May) to lower (end of June onwards) evaporative demand, there was an increase in grain yield while there was a reduction in ET and irrigation water applied. As a consequence, crop WP was enhanced.\\n\\nMulching with crop residues during the summer fallow can increase soil water retention (Feng, 1999). Sauer et al. (1996) found that the presence of crop residue on the surface reduced soil water evaporation by 34–50%. Straw mulching can be easily implemented by local farmers and can be extended on regional scale because the low cost straw is easily accessible and does not contaminate the soil. The use of raised bed planting can improve WP (Wang et al., 2004). Oweis and Hachum (2006) demonstrated that substantial and sustainable improvement in WP can only be achieved through integrated farm resource management.\\n\\n4.12. Water harvesting\\nWater harvesting may be defined as the process of concentrating precipitation through runoff and storing it for beneficial use. Water harvesting in agriculture is based on the principle of depriving part of the land of its share of rainwater (which is usually small and non-productive) and adding it to the share of another part. Where substantial amount of rainfall occurs over a few months and the other months of the year are dry, the excess water can be saved and used for dry season farming. This technique brings the amount of water available to the target area closer to the crop water requirements, so the economical agricultural production can be achieved and the water productivi\", 'unique_identifier': 8}\n",

Most of this increase will be met by the products of irrigated agriculture. At the same time, the water input per unit irrigated area will have to be reduced in response to water scarcity and environmental concerns. Water productivity is projected to increase through gains in crop yield and reductions in irrigation water. In order to meet these projections, irrigation systems will have to be modernized and optimised. Water productivity can be defined in a number of ways, although it always represents the output of a given activity (in economic terms, if possible) divided by some expression of water input. Five expressions for this indicator were identified, using different approaches to water input. A hydrological analysis of water productivity poses a number of questions on the choice of the water input expression. In fact, when adopting a basin-wide perspective, irrigation return flows often can not be considered as net water losses. A number of irrigation modernization and optimization measures are discussed in the paper. Particular attention was paid to the improvement of irrigation management, which shows much better economic return than the improvement of the irrigation structures. The hydrological effects of these improvements may be deceiving, since they will be accompanied by larger crop evapotranspiration and even increased cropping intensity. As a consequence, less water will be available for alternative uses.\\n\\nPrevious article in issueNext article in issue\\nKeywords\\nIrrigationModernizationOptimizationWater productivity\\n1. Introduction\\nToday's world population of 6000 million is expected to reach about 8100 million by 2030, an increase of 35%. The growing population will result in considerable additional demand of food. Simultaneously, the water demand from non-agricultural sectors will keep growing in both developed and developing countries. A recent FAO analysis (Anonymous, 2003) of 93 developing countries expects agricultural production to increase over the period 1998–2030 by 49% in rain fed systems and by 81% in irrigated systems. Therefore, much of the additional food production is expected to come from irrigated land, three quarters of which is located in developing countries. The irrigated area in developing countries in 1998 nearly doubled that of 1962. There are many reasons to believe that such rapid rate of expansion will not continue in the next decades. FAO estimates that the irrigated area in the selected 93 developing countries will only grow by 23% over the 1998–2030 period. However, the effective harvested irrigated area (considering the increase in cropping intensity) is expected to increase by 34%.\\n\\nThe question is whether there will be enough freshwater to satisfy the growing needs of agricultural and non-agricultural users. FAO expects that the withdrawal of irrigation water in the 93 countries of its study will grow during the period 1998–2030 by only about 14%, a small increase compared to the projected increase in the irrigated area. Crop water consumption per unit of area is expected to decrease by 3%, and gross crop water use by 16%. FAO explains most of this difference by an expected improvement in irrigation efficiency, that should result in a reduction in the water withdrawals per unit of irrigated area. Another part of this reduction will be due to changes in cropping patterns for some countries, such as China, where a substantial shift from rice (high-water demanding crop) to wheat (low-water demanding crop) is expected.\\n\\nUnderlying these projected figures is a notable increase in water productivity. The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) recently performed a study focusing on water productivity based on assumptions slightly different to those of FAO (Cai and Rosegrant, 2003). This study concluded that the average water productivity of rice will increase in the period 1995–2025 from 0.39 to 0.53 kg m−3 in developing countries and from 0.47 to 0.57 kg m−3 in developed countries. According to IFPRI, the average water productivity of all other cereals during the same period will increase from 0.56 to 0.94 kg m−3 in developing countries and from 1.00 to 1.32 kg m−3 in developed countries. Both the increase of crop yield (1% per year during 1995–2020) and the reduction of gross crop water use through improvements in basin efficiency (from 56% to 61%) will contribute to the increase of water productivity projected by IFPRI. The major expected contribution will come from the increase of crop yield. If, due to increasing environmental concern, water withdrawal is reduced with respect to the baseline scenario and higher basin efficiency is attained, then an additional 10% increase in water productivity is expected. Therefore, the goal to meet the projected water productivity needed to feed the growing population will be challenging breeders, agronomists and irrigation specialists in the upcoming years. The FAO model is based on the assumption that 2.5% of the existing irrigated area is rehabilitated or substituted by new irrigation systems each year, an activity that would commit a considerable investment in irrigation hardware and technology.\\n\\nThe aim of this paper is to discuss how the modernization and optimization of irrigation systems can contribute to the increase of water productivity in a context of global water scarcity. Attention will be paid to the role of irrigated agriculture in the satisfaction of the growing food demand.\\n\\n2. Addressing water scarcity\\nModernization and optimization of irrigation systems have often been promoted in public and private agendas as tools to improve irrigation efficiency, producing more agricultural goods with less water input. However, this represents just one approach to the solution of water problems. Allan, 1997, Allan, 1999 analysed the available alternatives to overcome water scarcity in a given society:\\n1.\\nUsing more virtual water\\n\\nThis alternative consists on importing products requiring large amounts of water in their production. All water-stressed countries already resort to virtual water to some extent. For instance, cereals and wheat flour are commonly imported commodities in dry regions. Middle Eastern and Northern African countries have had a seven fold increase in these imports between 1960 and 1992 (Allan, 1997). Imports by the end of the considered period amounted to 40 Mt, roughly equivalent to 40,000 hm3 of virtual water. This is an impressive figure, particularly when compared to the estimated 340,000 hm3 of regional renewable water resources (Abu-Zeid and Hamdy, 2002). In the period 1995–99, the virtual water balance of Australia showed a net export of 146,000 hm3 of virtual water, while Spain was a net importer, with 83,000 hm3 (Hoekstra and Hung, 2003).\\n\\n2.\\nImprove the economic efficiency of water\\n\\nSocieties reassign water uses to obtain maximum return per unit of water. This alternative comprises changes between groups of water uses (usually from agricultural to industrial and urban uses), and within each group. In the agricultural sector, farmers respond to market rules (among other issues) searching for the highest return per unit land or per unit water, depending on the relative scarcity of both resources.\\n\\n3.\\nImprove the technical efficiency\\n\\nThe strategy is to perform the same activities, but using less water. Technical efficiency has implications in all water related disciplines, including agronomy and plant breeding. In the irrigation field this is accomplished by increasing irrigation efficiency. In order to obtain this goal, there are two different procedures: improving the water structures, and improving water management.\\n\\n\\nConsidering these three alternatives (which are used simultaneously in most regions of the world) the preferred order is coincident with the order of presentation. However, regional decision makers prefer technical efficiency overall. According to Allan (1999), the reasons for choosing technical efficiency arise from the following facts: (a) it is an uncompromising choice; (b) it catalyses some economic sectors, such as construction; and (c) it does not produce explicit “losers”. In fact, all users touched by public investments will obtain some kind of gain, while the rest will remain the same. The compound balance will always be positive (thus avoiding zero-sum games).\\n\\nThese reasons seem important, but in fact all of them are negative and unsupportive of decision makers. However, there must be something positive about choosing technical efficiency. The following is a list of additional (positive) reasons in favour of technical efficiency in the field of irrigation. Most of these reasons are not related to water use, and fall in the categories of rural development and environmental protection, two appreciated externalities of the agricultural sector.\\n•\\nThe modernization of irrigation systems improves living conditions in the rural world. This effort would be a recognition of the “multifunctionality” of agriculture, a concept recently adopted by the European Union. There is more to irrigated agriculture than just the production of food and fibre. Irrigation keeps water linked to the rural areas, and stabilizes rural population in desert areas. It adds to the “communitarian value of water”. This theory is based on the existence of a strong link between water and the cultural values in rural areas.\\n\\n•\\nProper technical management improves the environment, since it effectively reduces the salt and nutrient leaching from irrigated areas (Rhoades and Suarez, 1977, Tedeschi et al., 2001, Cavero et al., 2003).\\n\\n•\\nThe modernization of the irrigation systems adds technology to agricultural production: rural employment becomes more attractive and competitive.\\n\\n\\nThis discussion leads to a prominent role of technical efficiency (irrigation modernization and optimization) in overcoming water scarcity. In order to evaluate its effect for a given society, a discussion of water productivity is required.\\n\\n3. Concepts of water productivity and scale considerations\\nWater productivity can be expressed as agricultural production per unit volume of water. The numerator may be expressed in terms of crop yield (kg ha−1). Alternatively, crop yield may be transformed into monetary units (i.e., € ha−1). The latter will be particularly convenient when comparing different crops or different types of water use. A number of options are available to define the volume of water per unit of area (m3 ha−1) in the denominator. Different water productivity indicators (€ m−3) result from choosing different options:\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n(3)\\n(4)\\n(5)\\n\\nThe value of the calculated water productivity increases in the sequence WP1 to WP5. Except in WP1, the denominators in the definitions of WP refer to diversion or consumption of irrigation water. In the irrigation context this is more convenient than considering total (rainfall plus irrigation) water.\\n\\nSome of the concepts of WP can be interpreted through different forms of technical efficiency: WP3 is related to the irrigation consumptive use coefficient (Burt et al., 1997) (ICUC, the volume of irrigation water consumptively used divided by the volume of irrigation water applied); WP4 to the irrigation efficiency (Burt et al., 1997) (IE, the volume of irrigation water beneficially used divided by the volume of irrigation water applied); and WP5 to the relative irrigation supply (Molden et al., 1998) (RIS, water diversion divided by irrigation requirements or crop evapotranspiration minus effective rainfall). In both ICUC and IE, Burt et al. (1997) subtract in the denominator the change of storage of irrigation water. In order to simplify, here we assume that the change in storage is negligible when dealing with the whole irrigation season.\\n\\nThe pertinence of one or another concept of WP depends on the hydrological domain. Although concepts WP4 and WP5 are valid at any scale, they are more meaningful at the field level since they are related to agronomic aspects of transforming evapotranspirated or leached water into crop yield. If the water that is used but not consumed (evapotranspirated) in an irrigation unit of the domain cannot be reused within the domain, then WP2 is pertinent (otherwise it is not comparable across scales). If the water used but not consumed can be reused downstream in the same domain, then WP3 is more appropriate.\\n\\nThe reutilisation of water depends on the hydrologic arrangement of the irrigation units. The water delivered to an irrigation unit may come from a canal common to several units, or it may be return flow from upstream units. When all the irrigation units receive the water directly from a common canal, those units are said to be in parallel. When an irrigation unit supplies all the water required by another unit located downstream, this downstream unit is said to be in series with the former. Irrigation units may be partially in series and partially in parallel or in complex arrangements. The ICUC of the whole water system will be the ICUC of the irrigation units if they are in parallel (the number of reuses is zero), it will increase with the number of reuses if the units are in series, and it will also increase with the number of units if they are partially in series and partially in parallel, but at a rate smaller than in the perfect series system. An improvement through modernization of the irrigation units’ ICUC will be translated into the same improvement for the whole system if the units are in parallel. However, if they are in series or partially in series, the increase of the whole system ICUC due to the increase of the irrigation units’ ICUC will be smaller as the number of units in series increases (Mateos et al., 2000).\\n\\nThis analysis extended to river basins is complemented by the concept of “closure” (Seckler et al., 2003). A river basin is said to be open when it has outflows of usable water in the dry season; it is said to be closing when it has no discharges of usable water in the dry season; and it is said to be completely closed when it has no discharges of usable water even in the wet season. Therefore, in closed basins (and more and more basins around the world are facing closure) additional water needs cannot be met through gains in WP1 or WP2 (addressing the productivity of used water), but must be met through gains in WP3, WP4 or WP5 (addressing the productivity of consumed water).\\n\\nWater planners often disregard these scale considerations and expect to transfer improvements in on-farm irrigation efficiency into additional water supply for other districts or to develop new irrigation projects. In many irrigation projects, excess irrigation water is the subject of downstream water rights (Willardson et al., 1994). In such cases irrigation modernization will not result in a net water gain. Moreover, any increase in crop water evapotranspiration will reduce the return flows and therefore interfere with downstream water uses.\\n\\nThese principles have led to the formulation of a water resources paradigm illustrated by Perry (1999) with a series of examples. Two of them are summarized below:\\n•\\nIn a Middle Eastern Country, structural investments improved irrigation efficiency from 40–50% to 60–70%. The purpose was to save water in order to expand the irrigated area. The results were unexpected: crop yield substantially increased in the area (due to improvements in distribution uniformity and irrigation scheduling). This yield increase was due to an increase in crop evapotranspiration. Therefore, there was no water surplus for irrigation expansion. However, the project did increase water productivity (WP2), since more agricultural output was produced with the same water stock.\\n\\n•\\nIn the United States a city offered to pay for the lining of a number of neighbouring irrigation canals to save water for domestic and industrial use. The conveyance and surface irrigation efficiency were presumed to be low. A detailed study showed that at the basin level 80–90% of the water was consumed by irrigation. Therefore, potential water “savings” were minimal. A complex cascade water reuse system was responsible for this high global performance. Similar results should be expected in large irrigation projects developed around riparian areas.\\n\\n\\nBoth examples underline frequent misconceptions in irrigation water use, and show how the prospects for water “saving” are bound to fail in most practical situations. Only in cases were water reuse is impossible (particularly when irrigation is performed by the coast) any increase in irrigation efficiency will lead to a net increase in the available water resources.\\n\\nThe water resources paradigm can only be applied to nested hydrological systems. If a subsystem is considered including for instance a reservoir and an irrigation project within a basin, any increase in the project irrigation efficiency will lead to a net increase in the reservoir stock. The term “water conservation” has often been used to refer to this apparent water gain. Water conservation does not enlarge water resources within the basin, but can effectively solve the problems of particular users or areas.\\n\\n4. Modernization actions and water productivity\\nThe concept of irrigation modernization has evolved over the last two decades. Originally it was restricted to the introduction of new physical structures and equipment. Now modernization is understood as a fundamental transformation of the management of irrigation water resources aiming to improve the utilization of resources and the service provided to the farmers. The transformation combines changes in rules and institutional structures, water delivery services, farmers irrigation scheduling, technical and managerial upgrading and advisory and training services, all in addition to the introduction of modern equipment, structures and technologies. Specific objectives of modernization include: increasing water productivity, increasing the cost effectiveness of funds, increasing the reliability and flexibility of irrigation deliveries, accepting the demand of other users, and meeting environmental requirements.\\n\\nIn this paper, we focus the discussion on the technical aspects of modernization, i.e., water management, systems operation, and upgrading of structures and equipment. The management and operation of the system is not independent of its design. In fact, new voices (Horst, 1998) are claiming that the root of deficient management is improper design of the systems. Nevertheless, the improvement of irrigation management has long been neglected by public planners, and has received very little attention. The advantages of improving water management can be summarized as:\\n•\\nCost effective, since its economic return (conserved water/investment) is often orders of magnitude larger than that obtained from improving the structures.\\n\\n•\\nUser appreciated, since it is a “bottom-up” process, in which users perceive management issues as their own. The goal is to obtain a process of slow, endogenous changes.\\n\\n\\nReferring to irrigation water, two levels can be identified: the farmer and the irrigation district. A discussion of modernization and optimization activities at both levels follows.\\n\\n4.1. The irrigation district\\nThe function of the conveyance and distribution systems and services should be providing sufficient water in a timely manner so that it can be used efficiently for crop production. Reliability, flexibility and efficiency are then keywords for a modernization plan. The reliability of an irrigation service is the degree to which the irrigation system and its water deliveries conform to the expectations of the users. The farmer may schedule irrigations and integrate other practices such as fertilization and pest control only if the irrigation delivery can be predicted. A reliable service allows efficient irrigation management within the constrains of the system. Moreover, if the irrigation delivery is flexible, the farmer can adapt the irrigation schedules to optimum cropping strategies and tactics that can be adjusted as the crop progresses. Therefore, both reliability and flexibility lead to higher irrigation efficiency and crop yield. Inflexible delivery (i.e., fixed-rotation delivery schedules or irrigation season restricted to a certain period in the year) limits the type of crops that can be grown and constrains agronomic tactics.\\n\\nAn illustration of this argument is given by Plusquellec (2002) referring to the use of groundwater in India. Crop yields obtained with groundwater irrigation are one-third to one-half larger than crop yields obtained with other sources of water. The difference is due to the greater water supply control obtained with groundwater. Irrigation scheduling can be adjusted to meet the crop water requirements. Thus, the use of fertilizers, pesticides and high yielding varieties is more intense, leading altogether to higher yields. A corollary is that the reliability and flexibility of the groundwater supply has resulted in increased water productivity in India and in many other areas of the world.\\n\\nThe improvement of irrigation structures via construction works has been the traditional way to improve irrigation efficiency. Many political instances have adopted ambitious plans to improve irrigation structures with objectives such as improving the competitiveness of local irrigated agriculture, rural development, environmental protection and increasing the available water resources (an impossible objective in closed basins, as previously discussed).\\n\\nAs an example, in Spain, the National Irrigation Plan (“Plan Nacional de Regadíos”, PNR) finances construction works affecting approximately 1.4 M ha out of the 4.0 M ha currently irrigated (Anonymous, 1998). The plan should be completed by 2008, although it is recognized that further actions will be required beyond this date. The typical PNR activity involves upgrading the collective irrigation structures of an irrigation district, often including part of the on-farm irrigation equipment. Districts using open channel conveyance networks and on-farm surface irrigation systems are currently adhering to the PNR in order to change to collective pressurized distribution networks and on-farm sprinkle/trickle irrigation systems. This financing scheme implies that in the following fifty years farmers will pay to the district some 250–300 € ha−1 y−1 to cover investment repayment, plus water diversion and operational costs. Farmers rely on the discussed yield increase and the reduction of irrigation labour (due to the automation of the new irrigation systems) to pay the investment back. Farmers’ response to the PNR so far is very positive, particularly in strongly rural areas with poor irrigation structures.\\n\\nIn many cases, however, technical efficiency and thus WP may be improved up to a certain degree through simple changes in management. As an example of district water management, the case of the Bardenas V irrigation district of north eastern Spain is presented (Lecina et al., 2005). This district operates 15,000 ha of mostly surface irrigation. Water allocation is performed by flexible arranged rotation from the Bardenas canal. Surface irrigation evaluation and simulation revealed that the current irrigation time in the district was 2.8 h ha−1, while the optimum irrigation time was much shorter: 1.7 h ha−1. If the irrigation time was reduced to its optimum value, the application efficiency would jump from the current value of 44% to a very adequate value of 70%. This difference of 26 points can be obtained via management improvement alone. A set of hydrological data from two irrigation seasons served to confirm this finding. Fig. 1 presents data from the 2000 and 2001 irrigation seasons. While in 2000 irrigation water was virtually unlimited, in 2001 there was a water shortage that induced farmers and district managers to conserve water. According to farmers’ interviews, these water conservation practices did not result in significant yield losses. In 2001 the global irrigation efficiency was almost 20 points higher than in 2000, revealing that there are real grounds for water conservation in the district from the management perspective. Since the crops, their yield and their evapotranspiration did not change substantially between both years, the increase in efficiency did not result in a significant increase in the productivity of consumed water (indexes WP3, WP4 and WP5), but increased significantly WP1 and WP2.\\n\\n\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 1. Hydrological analysis of the Bardenas V irrigation district of North Eastern Spain. Results are presented for the 2000 and 2001 irrigation seasons, representing normal and drought conditions, respectively. Adapted and reprinted from Lecina et al. (2005), with permission from Elsevier.\\n\\nTwo interesting approaches in district water management are the Irrigation Maintenance and Operations Learning Process (Skogerboe and Merkley, 1996) and the Management Improvement Program (MIP), a “coordinated and sustained effort to improve water management in an organization” (Dedrick et al., 2000). These efforts were set up in recognition that if district performance is poor it will not be enough to improve its water structures. The MIP process incorporates: a thorough understanding of the performance of irrigated agriculture in an area (diagnosis analysis); involvement by key decision makers in a joint decision process (management planning); and implementation of the planned changes by responsible operational managers (performance improvement).\\n\\n4.2. On-farm irrigation\\nIn the frame of modernized irrigation systems, technical on-farm irrigation management implies selecting the appropriate irrigation method and strategy according to the water availability, to the characteristics of the climate, soil and crop, to the economic and social circumstances, and to the constraints of the distribution system. It also requires the actual application of the scheduled water, its even distribution over the field, and the storage in the root zone of as much of the applied water as possible. The inherent and management-induced non-uniformity of the irrigation systems implies that some water deficit and/or percolation must occur even with the best irrigation schedule. Thus, there is a trade-off between uniformity, water deficit and percolation, that is illustrated in Fig. 2 assuming that the statistical distribution of the infiltrated water follows a normal distribution, and defining the deficit coefficient as the fraction of the root zone that is not filled with irrigation. It can be deduced from the abacus in Fig. 2 that the lower the distribution uniformity the lower the application efficiency required to not surpass a target deficit coefficient.\\n\\n\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 2. Relationship between deficit coefficient, application efficiency and distribution uniformity (DU) assuming normal distribution of the infiltrated applied water.\\n\\nOne extended irrigation practice is to apply the water necessary to bring the soil to field capacity. This practice avoids crop water deficit by assuring maximum crop evapotranspiration. But deficit irrigation can be economically desirable depending on the cost of the applied water, the price of the agricultural product and the yield response to water deficit. Regulated deficit irrigation, or the imposition of water deficit at only certain crop development stages, may reduce crop evapotranspiration with minimum or none reduction in yield. Therefore, regulated deficit irrigation may improve all forms of WP, from WP1 to WP5. Fereres et al. (2003) foresee potential in the use of regulated deficit irrigation in tree crops (where fruit rather than biomass is the marketable product and fruit quality is important) for reducing water use and consumption while maintaining or even improving grower profit.\\n\\nClemmens and Dedrick (1994) reported that all irrigation methods can attain approximately the same levels of efficiency. In spite of this fact, differences among irrigation systems appear in many areas as a consequence of design, management and maintenance. In north-eastern Spain traditional surface irrigation systems often show on-farm efficiencies close to 50% (Playán et al., 2000, Lecina et al., 2005), while properly designed and managed pressurized systems can attain 90% efficiency (Dechmi et al., 2003a, Dechmi et al., 2003b). As a consequence, changing the irrigation system (from surface to sprinkler) in field crops such as maize results in the following effects: (1) A sharp reduction in irrigation water demand (roughly, from 12,000 to 7000 m3 ha−1); (2) A relevant increase in crop yield (typically from 10,000 to 12,000 kg ha−1), resulting from improved irrigation uniformity, the control of the irrigation depth, and a flexible irrigation scheduling; and (3) an increase in crop evapotranspiration (typically from 5000 to 6000 m3 ha−1). These changes result in a significant increase in WP2.\\n\\nOn-farm irrigation management can also result in increases in WP5. Mateos et al. (1991) compared the water productivity of drip and furrow-irrigated cotton. An analysis of the original data adapted to the WP terminology presented in this paper permitted to conclude that, under full irrigation, WP5 was not significantly different for both irrigation systems. However, under deficit irrigation, WP5 was notably greater for drip irrigation than for furrow irrigation. As expected, WP2 was higher for drip irrigation than for furrow irrigation, both under full and deficit irrigation, and WP2 was always lower than WP5 (Table 1).\\n\\nTable 1. Water productivity of drip and furrow-irrigated cotton at two levels of water supply\\n\\nIrrigation supply\\tIrrigation method\\tWP2 (kg m−3)\\tWP5 (kg m−3)\\nFull\\tDrip\\t0.79\\t0.88\\nFurrow\\t0.52\\t0.90\\n\\nDeficit\\tDrip\\t1.05\\t1.15\\nFurrow\\t0.65\\t1.03\\nWP2 is yield divided by applied water and WP5 is yield divided by evapotranspiration of irrigation water.\\n\\n\\nPerhaps the greatest challenge is not developing new irrigation technology, but finding ways to reduce the large differences in technical efficiency, yield and water productivity that can be found among and within irrigated systems. Fig. 3 presents in abscise the relative irrigation supply (RIS, defined as the ratio between the annual water application and the annual irrigation water requirements for maximum yield) and its variation (horizontal bars) crop by crop in the Genil-Cabra irrigation district (Southern Spain) (Lorite et al., 2004). The Genil-Cabra district manages a modern well-operated pressurized-pipe network working on-demand. Despite these features, the RIS of the farms in the whole system has a remarkable standard deviation. Since the irrigation system does not impose any water supply restriction, the variation is due to other internal and external factors.\\n\\n\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 3. Relation between Relative Irrigation Supply (RIS) and WP2 in the Genil–Cabra irrigation district of Southern Spain. Values are averages for four irrigation seasons, and the bars depict twice the standard deviation. Adapted from Fig. 5 in Lorite et al. (2004), with kind permission of Springer Science and Business Media.\\n\\nThe first factor determining farmers’ decisions is the crop. The RIS of the different crops fell into two different groups: on one hand, four crops, cotton, garlic, sugar beet and maize, had average RIS values from 0.73 to 0.91; by contrast, winter wheat, sunflower and olive had much lower average RIS values, from 0.28 to 0.39. The first group represents the traditionally irrigated crops, while the crops in the second group have been primarily rain fed in the area until recently. Economic (subsidies and crop value) and agronomic (root diseases in the case of olive) reasons explain the attitude of the farmers in relation to the different crops, but the variation within each type of crop can be due only to variations of on-farm irrigation management.\\n\\nLorite et al. (2004) used a water balance and crop response model to estimate the variations in WP2 due to the variations in RIS.

Efficient use of the available irrigation water is therefore of important concern. Even though intensive research in the areas of crop physiology, irrigation engineering, agronomy and agricultural economics has developed several ways to improve the efficiency of irrigation water, a multidisciplinary approach is often regarded as the best future path to achieve further enhancements in meeting the forthcoming challenge of producing more and safety foods. Failure of irrigation production has profound effects on the welfare of all those employed in it and also their customers. Indeed, the scale of the industry is such that world food prices will be influenced by the overall performance of the irrigation farmers, but low food prices are essential to the welfare of the poorest people. The contribution of irrigation and water management to increased food production must come through both expansion of irrigation and improved management of existing water supplies. This review presents the past, current and future panorama of irrigation as a viable tool in ensuring food security on the globe. Considering past trends, this review empathizes that future irrigation technologies should be focused on providing the leadership and capacity to capture, develop and promote new irrigation practices and management systems to optimize production.\\n\\nKEYWORDS: Crop water efficiencyfood securityirrigationmodernizationoptimization\\nPrevious article\\nNext article\\nIntroduction\\nIrrigation is considered a prominent tool for ensuring food security and market-oriented production in the world (Alexandratos & Bruinsma Citation2012; IWMI Citation2013). The practice of flood-based farming existed in different parts of the world since ancient times but modernization of traditional system, especially by governments and nongovernmental organizations have become widespread over the last decade. Several projections of irrigation water demand and supply by 2025 and 2030 have been made and according to FAO forecasts (FAO Citation2012b), the share of irrigation in world crop production is expected to increase in the next decades. In developing countries in particular, the area equipped for irrigation is expected to have expanded by 20% (40 million ha) by 2030. This suggests that 20% of total land with irrigation potential but not yet operational will be brought under irrigation, and that 60% of all land with irrigation potential (402 million ha) will be in use by 2030. The net increase in irrigated land (40 million ha, 0.6% per year) projected to 2030 is less than half the increase over the preceding 36 years (99 million ha, 1.9% per year). The focus of irrigation development is consequently expected to be concentrated on the group of developing countries where demographic growth is strong (FAO Citation2011).\\n\\nIn Africa, large parts of the region have only limited freshwater resources. Even where water resources are definitely known to be substantial, other conditions may not be conducive to irrigation development and to permit reliable planning (IWMI Citation2013). In some areas, flood irrigation is being supplemented by other water harvesting structures such as ponds that make complementary irrigation and growing high-value crops possible (Prinz Citation2002). These problems do not entirely explain the historical failure to develop the full irrigation potential of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Many of the factors that drove irrigation development in the past (poverty alleviation, population growth and changing food preferences) continue to be felt (Rosegrant et al. Citation2002; Rahmato Citation2008; do Rosario Citation2012; Oates et al. Citation2015), but they need to be balanced with new needs for water in cities and industry (Molle & Berkoff Citation2006; GoM Citation2010; Mosca Citation2011). The most expensive irrigation schemes are found in SSA, where irrigation systems are usually smaller and developing land and water resources is costly. Construction cost estimates from the World Bank, based on analysis of ‘all possible projects' within each of several countries in SSA, are somewhat lower than the FAO estimates. The weighted average of irrigation costs across projects in Sudan was US$2850 per hectare; in Botswana, US$5900; in Kenya, US$5600; in Zambia, US$2000; and in Zimbabwe, US$9500 (Olivares Citation1990). Both the World Bank and FAO estimates cited above include only the direct cost for irrigation. However, the average cost of irrigation systems in SSA increases to US$18,300 if the typically high indirect costs of social infrastructure, including roads, houses, electric grids and public service facilities are included (Jones Citation1995). Increasing competition from the higher valued industrial and domestic sector results in a decrease in the amount of overall water allocated to irrigation. Irrigation construction costs have been even higher than in Asia due to numerous physical and technical constraints. The average investment cost for medium- and large-scale irrigation with full water control is estimated at US$8300 per hectare in 1992 dollars (FAO Citation2003). Slowdown in irrigation development is projected and this could reflect lower growth rate of food demand, combined with the increasing scarcity of suitable areas for irrigation and of water resources in some countries, as well as the rising cost of irrigation investment. According to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment Report (MA Citation2005), such issues are closely linked to having negative impact on the ecosystem, human health and also in meeting future food demand.\\n\\nIn recent decades, revolutionary developments have taken place in the science and art of irrigation (Dessalegn & Merrey Citation2015). A more comprehensive understanding has evolved regarding the soil–crop–water regime as affected by climatic, physiological and soil factors. These conceptual developments have led to technical innovations in water control that have made possible the maintenance of near-optimal moisture and nutrient conditions throughout the growing season (Setiyono et al. Citation2010). Despite all the new advances and promising possibilities, wasteful practices still persist in many irrigated areas. The outcome of some of the efforts is disappointing, particularly those related to modernization of the traditional schemes. In some places especially, sub-Sahara Africa, inefficiency is perpetuated by fixed, institutionally imposed standards that foster unmeasured and typically excessive applications of water (FAO Citation2011). Such inflexible regimes offer farmers no incentive to improve water management and even discourage them from taking independent initiatives to do so. Sijali (Citation2001) as well as Oates et al. (Citation2015) highlighted that some of the new irrigation systems developed in the industrialized countries are too complex, energy-intensive, dependent on expensive imported equipment and large in scale to be directly applicable to the low-capital, low-technology circumstances of the less-industrialized countries, where farming is often practiced on a small scale and the relative costs of labor and capital are very different. Hence, ready-made modern technology often fails when arbitrarily introduced into developing countries. Elaborate and expensive systems (such as large center-pivot booms and even drip-irrigation assemblies complete with automated pumps, filters, pressure regulators, metering valves and fertilizer injectors), imported and installed in the grand hope of achieving instant modernization, typically fail for lack of expert maintenance and spare parts. Such installations can quickly become white elephants – idle monuments to hasty ‘progress' relying on ill-adapted technology.\\n\\nNevertheless, in the face of increasing competition from the higher valued industrial and domestic sector results in a decrease in the amount of overall water allocated to irrigation, the global emerging pattern of development and adoption of low-cost, micro-irrigation technologies is likely to continue and even increase in the coming years (Grimm & Richter Citation2006). Also, there will be an increasing interest in affordable technologies of all types (Polak et al. Citation1997; Keller & Keller Citation2003), well adapted to private investments (Stillhardt et al. Citation2003; Keller & Keller Citation2005; Keller et al. Citation2005). Past and recent technological advances provide great potential in using irrigated agriculture for meeting future global food security threat (Freibauer et al. Citation2011). It is therefore imperative to critically assess how these irrigation water management systems have been incorporated into farming over the previous decades to effectively boost yield in the face of emerging needs for water in cities and industry (Molle & Berkoff Citation2006; GoM Citation2010; Mosca Citation2011). It is in the light of these challenges aforementioned that this review presents the past, current and future panorama of irrigation as a viable tool in ensuring global food security.\\n\\nIrrigation and food security\\nIrrigation and rain-fed agriculture are complementary and not mutually exclusive. Irrigation can assist in agricultural diversification, enhance food self-sufficiency, increase rural incomes generate foreign exchange and provide employment opportunities when and where water is a constraint (Hanjra et al. Citation2009). The World Food Summit of 1996 (FAO Citation2011) defined food security as existing ‘when all people at all times have access to sufficient, safe, nutritious food to maintain a healthy and active life’ (p. 1). Issues related to food supply, distribution and the overall aim of meeting the nutritional needs of all members of the household show that food security is clearly linked to its availability and safety. However, contributions to food security are more pronounced in group-based irrigation under National Irrigation Board (NIB) schemes. A typical example can be found in Kenya where under the NIB, rice has been used as the main crop, accounting for 90% of rice produced in the Kenya (Kimani & Otieno Citation1992). In arid and semi-arid lands, smallholder irrigation schemes have been used to supplement food.\\n\\nAccording to FAO (Citation2000), smallholder irrigation development has shown throughout the developing world that it can be used as a key drought mitigation measure and as a vehicle for the long-term agricultural and macroeconomic development of a country. Successful smallholder irrigation schemes can result in increased productivity, improved income and nutrition, employment creation and food security. However, socioeconomic evaluation of smallholder irrigation systems (FAO Citation2011) is very essential and also to help policy-makers in formulating sound policies for further irrigation development. Numerous empirical studies across the world have shown that irrigation has positive impact on food security and poverty (Dillon Citation2007; Mangisoni Citation2008; Omilola Citation2009; Anwar et al. Citation2013). With this in mind, many developing countries affected by droughts and floods promote irrigation interventions to reduce poverty and to promote food security.\\n\\nGlobal food projections indicate that food prices in the next three decades will likely be stable or decline, but progress in reducing malnutrition in developing countries will be slow (FAO Citation2012b). According to FAO (Citation2012b), statistics small shortfalls in crop productivity growth would lead to rising food prices and worsening malnutrition. Increased food production from irrigation is essential, and will require the expansion of irrigated area and water supplies, and improved efficiency of the use of existing water supplies. Neither of these growth factors will prove easy, and both will require complex institutional and policy reforms. Failure to meet food production needs through efficient expansion and strengthening of irrigated agriculture would increase pressure on land resources and hasten the process of environmental degradation. Irrigation and water development strategies have been hampered by a lack of understanding of the links between water scarcity, food production, food security and environmental sustainability. Research to improve this understanding would have high payoffs.\\n\\nIrrigation trends: history to now\\nGovernments have been the key investor of irrigation in many parts of the world for many thousands of years. They were the main investors in large-scale irrigation development in colonial India, Central Asia, the Western USA and emerging Australia in the late nineteenth century (Molle et al. Citation2009; Shah Citation2011). Starting in the 1970s, researchers began studying these institutional arrangements intensively, expecting they would offer lessons for improved management of large public irrigation schemes (Ostrom et al. Citation1993). During the twentieth century, there was a rapid expansion of investment in irrigation in China, particularly in the interwar and postwar periods and with Development Banks lending money for irrigation peaked between 1977 and 1979, and declined steadily thereafter (Rosegrant et al. Citation2002). Communities have collectively invested in small-scale irrigation over centuries throughout Asia, and management arrangements that have evolved over many years continue to be in use till today. However, these arrangements have proved difficult to apply in the context of large state-owned irrigation systems.\\n\\nIn India, surface irrigation systems supplied by canals and tanks currently account for less than 25 million ha of irrigated area, while groundwater irrigation supplied by owned and rented pumps and gensets (diesel/oil generators in combination with electrically driven pumps) accounts for more than 65 million ha of irrigated area. Shah et al. (Citation2009) noted that in the extreme, the cost of supplemental irrigation with gensets can reach 100 times the cost of gravity supply. According to Mukherji (Citation2007), Indian farmers invest in groundwater irrigation to maximize their income, as crop revenues are substantially greater with groundwater irrigation. A remarkable feature since the early 1980s has been the widespread emergence of private groundwater exploitation, which has become the dominant form of irrigation in India and makes major contributions in China, Pakistan, Thailand and many other countries, as the sole source and in providing a greater conjunctive use for surface irrigation systems. These major changes in irrigation provision are relatively recent, as shown in Table 1 between the situations before and after 1990.\\n\\nTable 1. Evolution of public irrigation since the 1960s.\\nDownload CSVDisplay Table\\nAccording to Alexandratos and Bruinsma (Citation2012), increasing donor dissatisfaction with the cost–beneﬁt performance of irrigation was partly responsible for a retreat from financing major infrastructural projects. The authors also noted that rising environmental concerns and international lobbying against large dams also played a role in this matter. At the same time, public policy in Western countries swung away from public development of subsidized water resource projects, which spilled over to developing countries, leading to a search for more self-sustaining models of irrigation development and management. Concurrent with the burgeoning private investment in groundwater, there has been increasing preoccupation with devolution of management, ownership and financial responsibility for irrigation systems to farmers (Turral Citation1995). In the European Union (EU), agricultural water demands considerably vary depending on climatic conditions and the relevance of irrigation in agriculture. For most Mediterranean countries, it is the major user of water resources (for irrigated farming and the livestock sector) (OECD Citation2006), having significant impacts on water quantity and water quality. The total area equipped for irrigation (total irrigable area) in EU-27 in the year 2003 accounts for 16 million ha on a total of 182 million ha of agricultural land (Eurostat Citation2000, Citation2003). The publication also noted that the majority of irrigated areas are concentrated in the Mediterranean region and France, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain account for 12 million ha corresponding to 75% of the total area equipped for irrigation in EU-27. In Central and Northern European countries, agricultural water abstractions account for less than 1% of total abstractions (e.g. Belgium 0.1%, Germany 0.5% and the Netherlands 0.8%). In these regions, temporary irrigation is generally used to improve production in dry summers, especially when the dry period occurs at a sensitive crop growth stage. In southern Europe, however, irrigation is an essential element of agricultural production and agricultural abstractions account for more than 60% of total abstractions (e.g. Spain 64%, Greece 88% and Portugal 80%) (OECD Citation2006).\\n\\nRecent periods have seen a dramatically rising cropping intensity, often in association with groundwater use. However, the rising level of development has resulted in many river and groundwater basins becoming fully allocated, or even over allocated, mostly to support agriculture. As populations continue to grow and economies develop, there is rising pressure to allocate, or more challengingly to reallocate, irrigation water to competing higher priority uses (Molle & Berkoff Citation2006), such as urban and rural domestic water supply and sanitation, industry and hydropower. With temperature increasing and precipitation fluctuating, water availability and crop production will decrease in the future. It is therefore important to find more efficient ways of irrigating the land and cut down on irrigation water use wastes. We can optimize the use of the little land available to us and use it more efficiently to meet the rising global population needs. Improving water productivity (WP) and keeping stable relations with global food suppliers will be very vital for food security.\\n\\nCrop response to water\\nThe utilization of techniques to management evapotranspiration (ET) as a major driving force in crop yields could be a major step in increasing production in the future (FAO Citation2012a). Potential crop yields typically increase linearly with the amount of water that is used by the crop (Figure 1). Water stress during critical time periods can result in lower than potential yields (Sam-Amoah et al. Citation2013). Crops, such as corn, respond with more yields for every cubic centimeter of water that the crop consumes as compared to winter wheat or soybeans. However, crops such as corn require more water for development or maintenance before any yield is produced (Schneekloth & Andales Citation2009) as indicated by where the yield-ET line intersects the X-axis. Grassini et al. (Citation2009) confirmed that corn requires approximately 10\\u2005in. of ET to produce the first increment of yield as compared to 4.5 and 7.5\\u2005in. of ET for wheat and soybeans (Figure 1). These crops also require less ET for maximum production. Irrigation is important to increasing ET and grain yields. Irrigation is used to supplement rainfall in periods when ET is greater than precipitation. However, not all of the water applied by irrigation is used for ET. Inefficiencies in applications by the system result in losses. As ET is maximized, more losses occur since the soil is nearer to field capacity and more prone to losses such as deep percolation (Figure 2).\\n\\nFigure 1. Yield versus ET (adapted from Grassini et al. Citation2009 and Schneekloth & Andales Citation2009).\\n\\nFigure 1. Yield versus ET (adapted from Grassini et al.

Yields versus irrigation (adapted from Schneekloth & Andales Citation2009).\\nDisplay full size\\nDeficit/limited irrigation\\nDeficit/limited irrigation is normally as a result of restricted supply of water so that full ET demands are met. Limited irrigation managements are practices that incorporate crop rotations, water management during the vegetative growth stages and farming practices to minimize water stress during the critical crop growth stages. According to Nelson (Citation2011) and Scott and Shah (Citation2004), the reasons for limited water supplies include reduced/low capacity of irrigation well and restrictions on pumping groundwater in regions where there is minimum groundwater. According to Zhang and Owesis (Citation1999), the application of only 50% of full supplemental irrigation requirement causes a yield reduction of only 10–15%. Assuming that under limited water resource, only 50% of full irrigation required by the farm would be available (i.e. 4440\\u2005m3 for a 4\\u2005ha field), the authors compared the limited irrigation with other options and showed that a farmer with 4\\u2005ha would, on average, produce 33% more grain if limited irrigation was applied over the whole area compared to full irrigation over part of the area. The limited irrigation increased the benefit with more than 50% compared with that of farmers’ usual practice of over-irrigation. When farmers cannot apply water to meet the ET of the crop, they must realize that with typical management practices, yields and returns from the irrigated crop will be reduced as compared to a fully irrigated crop. To properly manage the water for the greatest return, farmers must have an understanding of how crops respond to water, how crop rotations can enhance irrigation management, and how changes in agronomic practices can influence water needs. According to Sam-Amoah et al. (Citation2013), insufficient water may also lead to high soil moisture tension, plant stress and reduced crop yields.\\n\\nFull irrigation management has the greatest return per acre when water (capacity or allocation) is not limiting (Lamm Citation1989). However, when system capacities or allocations are limiting, reducing irrigated acres and full irrigation management of a single crop is generally not the optimum choice. A farmer must determine what the difference in economic returns when increasing irrigated acres of a low water use crop at lower than optimum water levels as compared to reducing irrigated acres of a high water use crop such as corn (Schneekloth & Andales Citation2009). Crops such as soybean and wheat have greater net returns at lower amounts of irrigation as compared to corn. Schneekloth et al. (Citation1995) confirmed that net returns were greater when a 3-year rotation of corn–soybean–wheat was irrigated with a 6 acre-inch/acre/year allocation as compared to a continuous corn growth. This was due to the increase in corn grain yields following wheat and the inclusion of lower water use crops such as soybean and wheat which had yields that were closer to fully irrigated grain yields as compared to corn. They also found that the variability in net returns was also reduced with a three-year rotation as compared to continuous corn. This was partly due to less variability in grain yields with the three-year rotation as compared to continuous corn. Schneekloth et al. (Citation2001) found that cropping rotations switched to include lower water use crops such as soybean or wheat as the amount of water that could be pumped was reduced. As the amount of allocation is reduced, irrigation of corn is reduced to slightly less than that of optimum with little reduction in grain yield and net return.\\n\\nImpact of water stress\\nCrops respond to water stress differently at several growth stages. According to Al-kaisi and Broner (Citation2014), many grain crops have little yield response to water stress during the vegetative growth stage and during late reproductive or grain fill growth stages. However, they emphasized that crops are sensitive to water stress during the reproductive growth stages, and yields will be impacted during this time period. When farmers have limited water supplies, but have control over when they can irrigate, limiting water during the growth stages that are the least sensitive to water stress while saving water for the critical growth stages can be a valuable strategy to maximize yield return from water. Figure 3 shows the yield susceptibility of corn through the growing season. Early water stress has less impact on grain yield as compared to the tassel to silk period. Water stress reduces transpiration as compared to a non-stressed crop. Stressing a crop during the time periods when water use is lower limits the total impact of water use reductions as compared to water stress during growth stages that have higher potential transpiration rates.\\n\\nFigure 3. Yields susceptibility (adapted from Sudar et al. Citation1981).\\n\\nFigure 3. Yields susceptibility (adapted from Sudar et al. Citation1981).\\nDisplay full size\\nIrrigation water quality versus crop yield\\nBoth irrigation water quality and proper irrigation management are critical to successful crop production. The quality of the irrigation water may affect both crop yields and soil physical conditions, even if all other conditions and cultural practices are optimal (Malash et al. Citation2005; Bauder et al. Citation2007). In addition, different crops require different irrigation water qualities. Therefore, testing the irrigation water prior to selecting the site and the crops to be grown are critical. The quality of some water sources may significantly change with time or during certain periods (such as in dry/rainy seasons), which implies that having more than one sample taken, in different time periods could be a much preferred option.\\n\\nThe parameters which determine the irrigation water quality are divided to three categories: chemical, physical and biological. In our review, the chemical properties of the irrigation water are discussed. The chemical characteristics of irrigation water refer to the content of salts in the water as well as to parameters derived from the composition of salts in the water; parameters such as electrical conductivity/total dissolved solids (EC/TDS), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) alkalinity and hardness (Hesterberg et al. Citation2014). Nearly all waters contain dissolved salts and trace elements, many of which result from the natural weathering of the earth's surface. In addition, drainage waters from irrigated lands and effluent from city sewage and industrial waste water can impact water quality. In most irrigation situations, the primary water quality concern is salinity levels, since salts can affect both the soil structure and crop yield. Excess of Na+ ions in soil may be also toxic to certain types of crops (Tiwari & Manzoor Citation1988; Nata et al. Citation2009; Ogunfowokan et al. Citation2009, Citation2013). However, a number of trace elements are found in water which can limit its use for irrigation (Chang & Page Citation2000; Yu-kui et al. Citation2009; Hesterberg et al. Citation2014).\\n\\nSalinity\\nOut of the main problems related to irrigation water quality is the water salinity (Bauder et al. Citation2007). The authors defined water salinity as related to the quantity of salts dissolved in the water without specific reference to the type of salts present in the water. High level of salts in the irrigation water reduces water availability to the crop (because of osmotic pressure) and causes yield reduction. Above a certain threshold, reduction in crop yield is proportional to the increase in the salinity level. Different crops vary in their tolerance to salinity and, therefore, have different thresholds and yield reduction rates. The most common parameters used for determining the irrigation water quality, in relation with its salinity, are EC and TDS (Table 2).\\n\\nTable 2. Salinity hazard of electrical conductivity/total dissolved solids.\\nDownload CSVDisplay Table\\nAccording to Guy (Citation2013), in case the irrigation water, salinity exceeds the threshold for the crop, yield reduction occurs. The following equation from Maas and Grattan (Citation1999) is used to estimate the yield potential, based on the irrigation water salinity.\\n\\n\\nwhere a is the EC threshold that the crop can tolerate, b is the percent loss in relative yield per unit increase in salinity and ECe is the electrical conductivity of the saturated soil paste, which is measured in the laboratory. ECe is proportional to the electrical conductivity of the irrigation water, depending on the percentage of irrigation water leached below the root zone.\\n\\nSodium hazard and irrigation water infiltration\\nIrrigation water containing large amounts of sodium is of special concern due to sodium's effects on the soil and poses a sodium hazard (Silva Citation2004; Siamak & Srikantaswamy Citation2008). Sodium hazard is usually expressed in terms of the SAR. SAR is calculated from the ratio of sodium to calcium and magnesium.\\n\\n\\nThe latter two ions are important since they tend to nullify the effects of sodium in the mixture. For waters containing significant amounts of bicarbonate, the adjusted sodium adsorption ratio (SARadj) is sometimes used. Continued use of water having a high SAR leads to a breakdown in the physical structure of the soil and water infiltration problems. Soil tends to seal and to become hard and compact when dry. Ironically, higher salinity reduces the negative effect of sodium on soil structure.\\n\\nCrop water efficiency versus climate change\\nIn recent years, global agriculture has been met with the new challenge of increasing food production for the growing population under increasing scarce water resources (Bouman Citation2007). This could be achieved by improving crop water efficiency (CWE; Kijne et al. Citation2003) and the sooner the mitigation activities begin, the lower the likely impacts. Adaptation will be needed to protect livelihoods and food security in many developing countries that are expected to be the most vulnerable, even under moderate climate change (Tubiello Citation2012). This indicates that the overall challenge of climate policy will be to find the efficient mix of mitigation and adaptation solutions that limit the overall impacts of climate change. This includes recognizing that many mutually re-enforcing synergies exist between specific mitigation and adaptation solutions that can lead to more efficient allocation of ‘climate response' resources. Importantly, many of these synergies exist in the forestry and agriculture sectors and are of great relevance to rural livelihoods in developing countries.\\n\\nClimate change could impact on rainfall and run-off and the availability of water for irrigation in many regions and countries in the world (IPCC Citation2010). A decline in rainfall along with an increase in temperature will increase crop water requirement due to high ET while less rainfall will increase crop net irrigation water requirements. As a result, the already existing water scarcity problem will exacerbate in many regions and countries, and affect food production. The hardest hit will be the areas with intense water scarcity and food security issues, such as the arid countries of SSA and parts of South Asia, which are already prone to malnutrition, poverty and even episodes of hunger (Brown & Lall Citation2006; Brown & Funk Citation2008; Funk et al. Citation2008). Climate change is expected to intensify problems of water scarcity and irrigation requirements in the Mediterranean region (Goubanova & Li Citation2006; IPCC Citation2007; Rodriguez Diaz et al. Citation2007). The main policy objectives in relation to water use and water stress at the EU level set out in the 6th Environment Action Programme (Citation1600/Citation2002/EC) and the Water Framework Directive (Citation2000/Citation60/EC) aim at ensuring a sustainable use of water resources. Accurately estimating irrigation demands (and other water uses as well) is therefore a key requirement for more precise water management (Maton et al. Citation2005). A number of countries in SSA already experience considerable water stress as a result of insu\", 'unique_identifier': 10}\n",

This system\\ncombined with participatory methods has achieved\\nsubstantial improvement in water use efficiency and\\nsugarcane yields for the benefit of small-scale growers.\\nThe system consists of a sugarcane simulation model, an\\non-line weather database and a communication network\\nwhich automatically provides farmers with near real-time\\nfield-specific irrigation advice and yield estimates using\\ncell phone text messages (SMS). More extensive\\ninformation is provided to the advisory support structure\\nby FAX and internet. The system has been adopted by\\nlarge number of small holders as well as commercial\\ngrowers.\\nIn South Africa and Australia, a simple mechanical\\ndevice called a ‘Wetting Front Detector (WFD)’, which\\nshows the irrigator as how deep the water has penetrated\\ninto the soil was introduced to help better irrigation\\nscheduling. The WFD also captures and stores a soil\\nwater sample after irrigation which can be used to improve\\nsalt and fertilizer management. The WFD provides\\ninformation about the depth of water penetration in the\\nsoil profile and helps them to make a decision about the\\ntiming and duration of the next irrigation, thereby\\nimproving on-farm water application efficiency leading\\nto water savings. To help irrigators, an interactive\\nvisualization tool ‘The Fullstop Game’ is provided on a\\nspecially developed website< www.fullstop.com.au>.\\nsince last irrigation and the visualization game shows\\nthem how deep the wetting front should penetrate down\\ninto the soil for drip and sprinkler irrigation.\\nIn China a new irrigation approach called Controlled\\nAlternate Partial Root-zone Irrigation (CAPRI) also called\\npartial root-zone drying (PRD) was applied to improve\\ncrop water use efficiency without significant yield\\nreduction. PRD involves alternate drying and wetting of\\nsubsections of the plant root zone by exploring the plant\\nphysiological and biochemical responses. It involves part\\nof the root system being exposed to drying soil while the\\nremaining part is irrigated normally. The wetted and dried\\nsides of the root system are alternated with a frequency\\naccording to soil drying rate and crop water requirement.\\nIn general, the CAPRI reduced the irrigation water\\nrequirement up to 50% without reduction of crop yield.\\nControlled Drainage: Controlled drainage helps in saving\\nfreshwater by providing part of the consumptive use\\nthrough capillary rise from shallow water tables. The\\nobjective of controlled drainage is to reduce subsurface\\ndrainage intensity during specific period of time by\\ntemporarily raising the level of the drain outlet. Capillary\\nrise from the raised water table contributes in moisture\\nsupply to the root zone. Experimental works in Egypt\\nshowed that up to 40% of the total water requirement\\ncould be saved through controlled drainage. In the case\\nof paddy rice, the water savings could exceed 50%.\\nUse of Poor Quality Waters: Use of partially treated or\\nuntreated sewage water irrigation for growing vegetables,\\nfodder for livestock and paddy is a common established\\npractice in peri-urban areas of most developing countries.\\nInternational Water Management Institute (IWMI) has\\nestimated about 20 million ha under ‘wastewater irrigation’\\nworldwide.

These are briefly mentioned as\\nfollows;\\nVirtual Water Trade: When a country imports a tonne\\nof wheat or maize, it is in effect, also importing \"virtual\\nwater\", i.e. the water required to produce that crop.\\nTrade in virtual water generates water savings for\\nimporting countries. Global water saving as a result of\\ninternational trade of agricultural products has been\\nestimated at about 350 billion m /year [6]. To maintain 3\\nfood security or food self-sufficiency, many countries\\nin the arid and semi arid regions have over-exploited their\\nrenewable water resources. Trade can help mitigate\\nwater scarcity if water-short countries can afford to\\nimport food from water-abundant countries. But political\\nand economic factors are stronger drivers and barriers\\nthan water. Many countries view the development of\\nwater resources as a more secure option to achieving\\nfood security and livelihood of its population. Large water\\nexporting countries may influence the policies of recipient\\ncountries. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop a\\nset of principles/rules governing virtual water trade\\notherwise conflict may prevail over cooperation [7].\\nReducing Wastage along the Food Chain: A study by\\nSIWI [8] has shown that by minimizing losses and\\nwastage along the food chain, the need for an additional\\nfood production – and therefore water – can be curtailed.\\nA large part of food produced at the field level is lost\\nor wasted before it arrives on our plate. In developing\\ncountries, a lot of produce perishes right on the farm,\\nin storage, during transport. Finally, substantial losses\\noccur during consumption and to a lesser extent during\\nretail, from discarded perishable products, product\\ndeterioration and the food that gets thrown into the\\ngarbage bin. According to the repot as much as 30% of\\nthe food produced is thrown away that is equivalent to\\nan estimated 40 BCM of water, enough to meet the needs\\nof 500 million people. A combination of policy measures\\nincluding investment support in post-harvest\\ntechnologies, the role of food processing industry and\\nsupermarkets as well as strategic efforts to visualize and\\neducate the public about how to practically contribute\\nto the reduction of food wastage is necessary.\\nof irrigation technologies on wide scale could be\\ntechnical, economic and social/ institutional. Technical\\nissues include - mismatch between the prevailing\\ntechnology and local needs, poor or lack of after sales\\nservices for maintenance and repairs, irregular or non\\navailability of energy and limited research and\\ndevelopment efforts in bridging the technology gaps.\\nEconomic issues are – high cost of technology, low\\ninvestment capacity of farmers, lack of investment\\nsupport, lack of access to market, low returns on\\ninvestment in agriculture.

To better understand irrigation scheduling’s main processes and principles, its four most common methods of operation—(1) evapotranspiration and water balance (ET-WB), (2) soil moisture (Θ) status, (3) plant water status, and (4) models—along with their pros and cons are introduced and compared. Irrigation applications, including software, programs, and associated controllers are introduced. Given that some of these methods focus on Θ or plant responses to soil moisture, the determination of target soil moisture levels, along with estimates (either calculated or measured) of current soil moisture status are key to both scheduling irrigations, and the precise replenishment of soil moisture to target levels. Accordingly, factors in the soil-crop-atmosphere system affecting soil moisture must be considered in the scheduling process. As all four types of IS methods focus on soil water content, which serves as a bridge between irrigation management and crop water requirements for growth, future scheduling methods should focus on the management of soil moisture based on an advanced understanding of its effects on crop growth either by the integration of existing IS methods or the development of new models, using intelligent algorithms. Using these approaches, more practical, accurate, and easily adaptable IS applications should be developed for real-time farming operations. Weather station networks and online data access should be enhanced to better serve these IS applications.\\nIntroduction\\nThe roughly \\n ha of arable lands currently (2015) cultivated in the world represent about 11% of the Earth’s total land surface (World Bank Group 2019). This percentage is predicted to reach 13% by 2050 (Alexandratos and Bruinsma 2012). Of these arable lands, roughly 17% are subject to any form of irrigation management. However, this relatively small fraction of land equipped for irrigation may contribute as much as 30%–40% of the world’s gross agricultural output (Walker 1989). Driven by rising urban and industrial competition for limited water resources (Fernández and Cuevas 2010; Walker 1989), high agricultural water consumption (40%–80%) (Bazzani 2005; FAO 2001), and water wastage (Walker 1989), the global water scarcity crisis is worsening. Faced with limited arable and irrigated lands, and limited water resources, future agriculture must nonetheless try to feed an increasing population. This places greater stress on irrigation management to improve water use efficiency (WUE) and productivity (FAO 2001).\\nThe water scarcity also poses new challenges on urban water utilities, where the need for landscape irrigation will continue to grow with increasing populations (Davis et al. 2009; Mayer et al. 1999). It was reported that 72% of study participants applied less than 70% of the theoretical irrigation requirement (TIR) to landscape, with about 27% applying only about 10% of TIR; in contrast, about 13% applied excess irrigation (exceeding 130% of TIR), and some even applied more than 300% of TIR (DeOreo et al. 2016). For such landscape irrigation, a well-devised schedule benefited both plant quality and water savings, as an estimated 20%–50% water savings was achieved when using mild to aggressive landscape conservation practices (DeOreo et al. 2016).\\nThe importance of water in plants arises from its role in supporting photosynthesis, regulating temperature via evaporative cooling, maintaining structure through cell turgor pressure (i.e., in maintaining leaf orientation), and transporting nutrients into and throughout the plant, thereby supporting its growth. While irrigation guarantees crop growth in regions where rainfall is insufficient to support crop growth and yield, it must be scheduled properly, lest crops suffer water stress at a critical growth stage, or excess water applied that leads to ponding, waterlogging, runoff and/or deep seepage, thereby leaching applied nutrients and polluting water bodies. Though in regions where soil salinity is of a concern, excessive water is required to be applied to leach the salts down in the soil profile. Over the last few decades, a number of methods for scheduling and quantifying the required depth of individual irrigation applications have been proposed. The present paper reviews a number of irrigation scheduling (IS) methods effectively employed in determining appropriate irrigation timing and depth for crop growth; however, reports on these methods seldom consider their economic impacts, government policies, or water supply constraints. Some methods, do, however, aim to schedule irrigations to achieve optimum water productivity and net economic returns. Irrigation for salt leaching is not within the scope of the present paper; however, irrigation schedules developed through the IS methods presented here, can serve as the basis for salt leaching irrigation decisions. For example, using methods discussed in the present paper, Hoffman et al. (1990) employing the leaching requirement \\n, considering the salinity of the irrigation water and the crop salt tolerance threshold, and setting the depth of water infiltrated to (\\n) times the soil water deficit were able to develop an effective irrigation for salt leaching regime.\\nThe quantity of water applied and the timing of its application are both of significant importance in IS whether in landscape or agricultural applications (McCready and Dukes 2011; Vellidis et al. 2016b). A good irrigation schedule, achieved through well-informed IS criteria, can provide significant irrigation water savings, whether it be for landscape applications, agricultural crop yield and quality, or turf quality. Among the various IS approaches that have been proposed and developed, four types can be distinguished according to what scheduling rests upon: (1) evapotranspiration (ET) and soil water balance, (2) soil moisture (Θ) status, (3) plant water status, and (4) simulation model output. Although evapotranspiration and soil water balance (ET-WB) is a sort of modeling, this paper separated the two components with a model-based IS method in this context to address the popularity in application and inspiration of basic components during the scheduling procedure.\\nEvapotranspiration and Soil Water Balance–Based IS\\nET-WB-Based Approach\\nThe ET-WB method is a widely used IS method whereby the main consumptive element, crop evapotranspiration (\\n), is first estimated according to methods outlined in the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Irrigation and Drainage Paper 56 (Allen et al. 1998), and the daily soil water deficit then calculated on the basis of the soil water balance equation. Irrigation events are scheduled when the total water depletion exceeds the readily available water (RAW, Huffman et al. 2013)\\n(1)\\nwhere RAW is in a dimension of L, \\n is the root zone depth or that of a soil layer within the root zone (L), MAD is the management allowed depletion (i.e., a fraction of the total available water that is allowed to be depleted), \\n is volumetric Θ at field capacity (\\n), and \\n is volumetric Θ at the permanent wilting point (\\n). Values of \\n and \\n for different soil textures can be found in Huffman et al. (2013).\\nSuggested MAD values for four crop groups at nine rates of maximum daily evapotranspiration can be found in Huffman et al. (2013) as well and Doorenbos and Kassam (1979). For example, for maize (Zea mays L.), soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), suggested MAD is 0.6 when a maximum daily \\n is \\n, or 0.7 when \\n is \\n. When irrigation is triggered, Θ is generally returned to \\n (Huffman et al. 2013).\\nAs crop requirements (\\n) are estimated during the crop growth process, the ET-WB method is a fundamental and important IS approach. The estimation of \\n is the key point of the ET-WB method and can be achieved through different calculations drawing on a range of remote sensing measurements (Glenn et al. 2007; Pereira et al. 2015). However, since this paper concentrates on IS methods rather than the estimation of \\n, these studies related to the improvement of \\n (or \\n and \\n) estimation are not detailed here. Due to the fact that direct \\n measurement is costly and labor intensive (e.g., using lysimeters), it is generally estimated using the crop coefficient (\\n) multiplied by the reference evapotranspiration (\\n). The \\n can be calculated from meteorological data using the well-known FAO Penman-Monteith equation (Allen et al. 1998). The \\n is normally selected through a single crop coefficient approach, or a dual crop coefficient approach when separate crop transpiration (\\n) and soil evaporation (\\n) coefficients are considered (Allen et al. 1998). It is challenging to calibrate the \\n value using \\n and \\n measured through a site-specific field lysimeter experiment, because the \\n values obtained through this calibration may vary dramatically each day during the growing season due to various factors in the soil-plant-atmosphere system (López-Urrea et al. 2009). Therefore, \\n values used in irrigation scheduling are usually derived using a piecewise linear approach using the procedures and tables in Allen et al. (1998) as a mean \\n approach that avoids the variability of actual daily \\n.\\nThe performance of ET-based IS methods varies under different management systems. Davis et al. (2009) showed that when maintaining turfgrass quality an ET-based IS method significantly reduced irrigation water use. However, compared to traditional experience-based irrigation regimes, ET-based irrigation in some cases failed to achieve the same crop yield (Hunsaker et al. 2015) or turf quality (McCready et al. 2009) due to a lower allowance of the soil water content during the growing season. When testing the performance of satellite-based ET irrigation controllers, Devitt et al. (2008) found that 81% of ET-based controllers (scheduled automatically according to ET data) achieved water saving when the controllers were individually programmed at each site according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.\\nThe ET-based method depends strongly on (1) the accuracy of the estimated \\n, (2) building a better crop coefficient (\\n) curve over the growing season using a single or dual crop coefficient or site-specific calibration approach, (3) evaluating soil properties to determine the soil’s water holding capacity, and (4) measuring site-specific rainfall (Davis and Dukes 2010). Improving the accuracy of estimating all these parameters is the main challenge of ET-WB-based approach, and therefore to minimize the accumulative error of soil water deficit estimation. Another challenge of this approach is spatial and temporal variability for a large-scale \\n estimate. Gowda et al. (2008) found that although daily \\n was accurately estimated based on remote sensing data, the spatial and temporal resolution of this data may limit its use for mapping spatial \\n distribution for irrigation scheduling purposes, especially at the field-scale level of 10–200 ha. However, ET-WB-based IS showed advantages in some cases due to its feasibility. When a scientific (versus experience-based) IS scheduling method is first implemented over a growing season, the ET-WB method is relatively easy to implement and is proven effective when field weather data and FAO suggested \\n curves for the crop are available. The ET-WB method remains feasible even if soil properties are unknown, assuming the accumulated daily soil water deficit calculated by \\n estimates is quenched in a timely manner. For instance, irrigations can be triggered at a fixed interval (e.g., every 3 days or twice a week) to quench the soil water deficit calculated by \\n estimates (Grabow et al. 2013; Davis et al. 2009). However, recharging the soil to \\n may increase the risk of percolation if a precipitation event occurs in days immediately following the irrigation event. Thanks to easy access to field weather data, this method is applicable to fields all over the world, and various ET-based irrigation software and control systems have been developed to facilitate scheduling.\\nET-WB-Based IS Applications\\nSome computer applications, including software and decision support systems (DSSs), have been developed to implement ET-WB-based IS and to liberate farmers from laborious calculations and the need to understand the science of the method. Among these, the SmartIrrigation apps (Migliaccio et al. 2013, 2016) will be highlighted. These applications are related strictly to irrigation scheduling, namely irrigation timing and quantity determination, without considering economic and government regulatory factors (Yang et al. 2017).\\nSmartIrrigation apps are interactive ET-based IS tools that operate on smartphone platforms. Several apps have been developed for different plants, such as citrus, turf, strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duchesne), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), avocado (Persea americana Mill.), and vegetables, and is still under development for other crops, like blueberry (Vaccinium sect. Cyanococcus) and soybean. These apps are available on the website (Smart Irrigation Apps Group 2019). SmartIrrigation apps were first released in 2013 by Migliaccio et al. (2013) for citrus, turf, and strawberry, and further crop apps were later developed. SmartIrrigation apps were developed based on an \\n and water balance model, using meteorological data, soil parameters, crop phenology, crop coefficients, and irrigation applications to estimate root zone water deficit (see “ET-WB-Based Approach” section). The apps notify users when irrigation is needed and the amount of water to irrigate. Vellidis et al. (2014, 2015, 2016a) described the development of the SmartIrrigation Cotton app, along with the calibration, validation, and field evaluation of the model integrated in the app. The Cotton app was reported to be able to predict soil water content reasonably well and to save water when compared to other IS methods (e.g., Checkbook and CWSI methods, discussed in section “Crop Water Stress Index Method”). However, in a wet year, it failed to achieve higher yields and WUE than the simply rainfed treatment (Vellidis et al. 2016b). Migliaccio et al. (2016) in introducing the development of SmartIrrigation apps for different crops, pointed out their limitations: these apps are currently only useful in Florida and Georgia and only for those crops grown in fields in proximity to meteorological stations. Considering spatial variation in rainfall, and the finite set of weather stations, it is spatially limited in making accurate schedules.\\nBesides the SmartIrrigation apps, several IS applications have been successfully applied. Using a dual crop coefficient approach to estimate \\n, Rosa et al. (2012a, b) developed and tested the SIMDualKc software to simplify the computation and quickly provide \\n information for irrigation scheduling. Employing a short-term water balance that can be adjusted according to measured Θ trends, the Washington Irrigation Scheduling Expert software (WISE; Leib et al. 2001), allows easy access to \\n values from Washington State’s sixty Public Agriculture Weather System stations. Thysen and Detlefsen (2006) described an internet implementation of a previous stand-alone PC-based irrigation decision-making program based essentially on an \\n and water balance method. Chauhan et al. (2013) introduced a web-based DSS, AQUAMAN, to assist Australian peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) growers to schedule irrigation based on the ET-WB method introduced in FAO-56. Bartlett et al. (2015) developed a smartphone app to extend the usage of the Water Irrigation Scheduling for Efficient Application system, an ET-WB-based IS tool developed by Colorado State University. Perea et al. (2017) developed a multiplatform application (IrriFresa) for precision irrigation scheduling in strawberries, consisting of a PC and a mobile module, based on \\n simulated by the Hydrus 2D model. This application offers farmers daily/weekly information about irrigation amount and timing. Car et al. (2012) developed a system, IrriSatSMS, using mobile phone text messages to provide farmers with irrigation scheduling advice based on water balance calculation.\\nSome ET-based controllers are also widely employed in landscape irrigation systems (Dukes 2012), providing both irrigation decisions and control signals to the system. Devitt et al. (2008) evaluated the water saving potential of an ET-based satellite irrigation controller. In another study, three brands of commercial ET controllers (Toro Intelli-sense, ETwater Smart Controller 100 and Weathermatic SL1600) were evaluated and shown to provide, on average, a 43% water saving compared to the time-based irrigation approach without a rain sensor (Davis et al. 2009). Only half of the theoretical irrigation requirement was applied by the three brands of ET controllers (Davis and Dukes 2010).\\nSoil-Moisture-Based IS\\nIrrigation Timing and Amount\\nThe Θ-based IS methods compare monitored Θ (inferred from sensor measurements) to Θ-based thresholds to trigger irrigation (timing). The monitored Θ is commonly measured by time domain transmission sensors or reflectometry probes, neutron probes, capacitance sensors, granular matrix sensors, etc. (Hedley and Yule 2009; Migliaccio et al. 2010; Thompson et al. 2007b). Related to Θ, soil water tension or soil matric potential (\\n), measured by tensiometers, is another parameter used to quantify soil water available for plant use.\\nIn an effort to benefit crop growth, yield, and quality, Θ-based IS methods focus mainly on determining when irrigation should be applied to maintain root zone Θ within an appropriate range (Viani 2016). Various methods have been proposed to determine irrigation timing based on a lower limit or threshold of Θ, \\n (Haley and Dukes 2012; Zotarelli et al. 2010), e.g., \\n; or when soil tension, \\n, reaches a set threshold (Hoppula and Salo 2007; Migliaccio et al. 2010; Thompson et al. 2007b), e.g., \\n. The threshold value varies according to soil properties and crops, and is determined either through field experiments, where crop responses to different levels of water stress under various irrigation treatments are investigated (Hoppula and Salo 2007; Migliaccio et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2017), or drawn from existing studies (Haley and Dukes 2012). Therefore, these thresholds are optimized for specific locations and crop species due to their responses to crop growth, yield, and quality, etc. Thompson et al. (2007b) proposed an alternative to determine threshold values of \\n, using an indicator of plant water stress, the leaf water potential (\\n). A linear regression was established between \\n and \\n for conditions ranging from well-watered to nonwatered, and the point where the relationship broke from a linear relationship was chosen as the \\n threshold. Thompson et al. (2007a) also proposed an in situ approach for determining the lower limit in \\n-based irrigation management, by monitoring reductions in Θ as a reflection of crop water uptake.\\nBesides the use of Θ or \\n thresholds, the available soil water content threshold (\\n) has also been employed in Θ-based IS approach, to which the actual available soil water content (AWC, %) is compared:\\n \\n(2)\\nwhere \\n is the actual (measured) volumetric soil water content (\\n). The value of \\n was determined graphically as the value of AWC where \\n of unwatered plants started to diverge from that of fully irrigated plants using a linear relationship (Thompson et al. 2007b). Basically, the \\n is equivalent to the Θ threshold, \\n, under a soil of specific moisture capacity and soil depth (Fig. 1):\\n \\n(3)\\n\\nFig. 1. Similarity and differences in defining the soil moisture content threshold (\\n) between ET-based methods and AWC threshold methods. AW = available water; AWC = available soil water content; \\n = available soil water content threshold; MAD = management allowed depletion; RAW = readily available water; \\n = actual volumetric soil water content; \\n = volumetric soil moisture at field capacity; \\n = volumetric soil moisture at permanent wilting point; and \\n = soil moisture threshold.\\nOPEN IN VIEWER\\nHowever, the use of fixed \\n values has proved unreliable for irrigation scheduling, given uncertainties arising from the definition of rooting depth, measurements of \\n and \\n, as well as sensor calibration and sensor accuracy (Thompson et al. 2007b). Accordingly, the adoption of a dynamic rooting depth along with dynamic \\n and \\n values across the rooting depth (Gu et al. 2017a; Liu et al. 2017) can probably improve irrigation performance.\\nUnder Θ-based irrigation scheduling, the most common way to determine the necessary depth of irrigation is to apply a threshold-based quantity (Migliaccio et al. 2010; Zotarelli et al. 2010), or a fixed quantity irrigation at each event using an existing timer/controller (Haley and Dukes 2012). The threshold-based method interrupts irrigation when the threshold condition no longer exists, i.e., when \\n drops below the threshold value (e.g., \\n), where the sensor measuring the soil water status acts as a switch to turn on and off the irrigation events (Migliaccio et al. 2010). Similar to an ET-WB-based approach, the irrigation depth determined by Θ-based methods can also represent the quantity of water needed to refill the soil profile to \\n (Wang et al. 2017), i.e., irrigation ceases when \\n reaches \\n (Haley and Dukes 2012; Hoppula and Salo 2007). However, without considering leaching requirements for soil salinity control, recharging the soil up to a value lower than \\n is recommended to avoid percolation and to increase the WUE. When applying irrigation up to the soil’s \\n, soil properties need to be appropriately estimated. Among the irrigation amount determination methods, applying a fixed amount of irrigation is effective in alleviating water stress, at the risk of, however, leading to either deep percolation or insufficient irrigation, resulting in water and nutrient loss or impaired crop growth.\\nStirzaker et al. (2017) proposed a novel irrigation timing and depth determination method whereby irrigation was triggered and aborted according to the activation/nonactivation of wetting front detectors installed at soil depths of 300 and 600 mm. However, the installation density of detectors was too coarse to provide acceptable results on all occasions, thereby limiting its applicability. By localizing the wetting front using soil impedance measurements (Gnecchi et al. 2015), wetting-front-detector-controlled irrigation scheduling might be improved.\\nThe Θ-based method has the advantage of allowing variable rate irrigation scheduling due to its capacity to measure spatial and temporal Θ variability in the field. Accordingly, the spatial differences in irrigation quantity required for different blocks of the field can be considered. As an alternative to using a sensor array (Vellidis et al. 2008, 2013), Hedley et al. (2013) investigated the use of an electromagnetic mapping technique to map the soil water status and soil properties including AWC and \\n (Hedley and Yule 2009), which were used to determine the triggering threshold (\\n or \\n). In contrast to the low spatial resolution of Θ measurements using traditional sensors, electromagnetic mapping techniques have the potential to achieve a high spatial resolution in both Θ and soil properties, and therefore serve to map \\n to a higher resolution and schedule a more accurate variable rate irrigation (Hedley and Yule 2009). The major weakness of an Θ-based IS approach resides in the inaccuracy of Θ measurements using sensors (Evett et al. 2011). Practically, Θ sensors are used to track soil water trends and then coupled with other IS approaches.\\nRelationships between Θ-Based and ET-WB-Based Approaches\\nBoth ET-WB-based and Θ-based methods apply soil water balance equations to schedule irrigation, though different current soil water estimations and triggering thresholds are employed. Under the ET-WB-based IS method the lower limit of Θ (triggering threshold) is defined using MAD, while Θ-based approaches use \\n. However, when \\n, the \\n defined in Eq. (3) is equivalent to the lowest limit defined in Eq. (1) (Fig. 1). With regard to determining the level of \\n, the difference between the Θ-based method and the ET-WB-based method resides in the former using site-specific field experiments to assess the threshold (Thompson et al. 2007a, b), whereas the ET-WB-based method uses a default value drawn from FAO-56 (Allen et al. 1998). For the current Θ status, the ET-WB-based method employs an estimated deficit to \\n, which is calculated through \\n estimation and a water balance equation; whereas the Θ-based method employs Θ sensor measurements. The adoption of different current Θ estimations and triggering thresholds in irrigation timing is summarized in Table 1. With these different combinations of current Θ estimates and triggering thresholds, different irrigation timing methods have been applied in practice. For example, using a soil water balance equation to predict current \\n, irrigation was triggered when the calculated \\n dropped below a preset threshold (Haley and Dukes 2012), making it easier to conduct irrigation scheduling as Θ sensors and soil \\n properties were not necessary in this case. However, under the effect of capillary rise from a shallow water table and/or lateral flow, soil-water-balance-predicted Θ may underestimate \\n (Hedley and Yule 2009). Hedley and Yule (2009) applied an MAD value of 0.55 to define \\n, such that irrigation was triggered when \\n reached this threshold (Table 1). Evett et al. (2011) investigated whether Θ sensors were sufficiently accurate to conduct IS using a MAD-defined threshold and found that they all required soil-specific calibration except conventional time domain reflectometry probes.\\nTable 1.

Limited to three crops—peanuts (Arachis hypogaea L.), corn, and cotton—Irrigator Pro has been evaluated and applied for the implementation of variable rate irrigation (VRI) (Bauer et al. 2008; Lamb et al. 2015; Stone et al. 2015; Vellidis et al. 2013). The system seeks to maintain soil temperatures and Θ within their optimum ranges according to principles described on the website of the USDA-ARS National Peanut Research Laboratory (USDA-ARS, National Peanut Research Laboratory 2019a, b). Employing a largely Θ-based method, Irrigator Pro triggers irrigation in one or more of these situations:\\n1.\\t\\ndry soil, namely when \\n drops below zero, where the \\n is calculated as the difference between \\n—estimated by Θ probe readings—and a baseline Θ (e.g., set to when soil \\n equals to 40 kPa);\\n2.\\t\\nheat stress, when the maximum soil temperature since the last watering event (rain or irrigation) reaches the allowed maximum; and/or\\n3.\\t\\nwhen a specific crop growth stage is reached, irrigation is applied until the \\n reaches its maximum for the field’s soil type.\\nWhen soil moisture probe readings are not available, the \\n can alternatively be calculated using a checkbook method based on rainfall, irrigation, and expected water use. Though Irrigator Pro provides no specific recommendations for the quantity of irrigation to be applied, it is able to predict the timing when irrigation is needed through a criteria that the \\n drops below 0.0 in the next 7 days.\\nBased on a Θ-based scheduling method Gutiérrez et al. (2014), Nemali and van Iersel (2006) developed soil moisture sensor (SMS) controllers to maintain a certain Θ. For such systems, the installation of a wireless sensor network is usually necessary for field-scale irrigation management (Haule and Michael 2014; Vellidis et al. 2008). The performance of several brands of SMS controllers available on the market (e.g., Acclima, Rain Bird, Irrometer, Water Watcher, etc.) relies on their accuracy in measuring volumetric Θ (Cardenas-Lailhacar and Dukes 2010). The evaluation of well-programed ET controllers and SMS controllers showed a reduction in water application compared to time-based treatments in which irrigation was set at a fixed time interval (McCready and Dukes 2011; McCready et al. 2009).\\nPlant-Based IS\\nInstead of using the Θ threshold to schedule irrigation in Θ-based IS methods, plant-based IS methods use plant-water-status-related indices. Plant-based IS methods are based on the relationship between crop water stress and soil water deficit. Accordingly, they can be used to define the optimum Θ level for crop growth. As the sensitivity to water deficit varies among different plant species, plant tissues, and crop phenological stages, a wide range of plant-based stress measurements have been proposed as being germane to irrigation scheduling. Reviewing plant-based measurements for irrigation scheduling, Jones (2004) found two principal categories:\\n1.\\t\\nplant-water-status-based—direct measurements of leaf/xylem/stem water potential and indirect measurements of leaf thickness, stem and fruit diameter variation, and turgor pressure (Padilla-Díaz et al. 2016); and\\n2.\\t\\nthose based on plant physiology—measurements of sap flow, xylem cavitation, stomatal conductance, and thermal sensing.\\nAn efficient plant-based irrigation program depends on whether whatever measurement is made is sensitive enough to properly assess the water deficit for the specific plant/crop (Jones 2004). For example, plants with strong endogenous control systems maintain a stable leaf water status over a wide range of evaporative demand or soil water supplies; therefore, one cannot use plant water status as the index for irrigation scheduling. These include cowpea [Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.], corn, and poplar (Populus L.). Since leaf/xylem/stem water potential are not well adapted for automation of irrigation scheduling due to difficulties in real-time measurement, stem diameter variation (SDV), sap flow and canopy temperature sensing are more often applied in automatic irrigation systems. While SDV and sap flow are mostly used for commercial orchard plants, e.g., grapevine (Vitis L.), apple (Malus domestica Borkh.), pear (Pyrus communis auct. iber.), and olive (Olea europaea L.) trees (Steppe et al. 2008; Fernández et al. 2008), thermal sensing technique are more commonly used for herbaceous crops and trees, e.g., soybean, cotton, grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] (O’Shaughnessy and Evett 2010; O’Shaughnessy et al. 2011, 2012), corn (Evett et al. 1996; DeJonge et al. 2015), bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.)', 'unique_identifier': 22}\n",

Howell*\\nABSTRACT\\nFuture demands on the world’s limited water resources and the demands to adequately feed\\nand clothe an expanding population require that irrigation efficiency and crop productivity from\\nirrigated lands improve. Irrigation scheduling is an important element in improving water use\\nefficiency. Several new plant and soil water sensor technologies have direct implications for\\nimproving irrigation management. Irrigation scheduling research priorities are recommended to\\nfocus on evapotranspiration (ET) estimation methods, on improved understanding of spatial\\nvariation of ET and irrigation applications, on identifying the water balance components in typical\\nirrigated agriculture, on integrating various sensing technologies into irrigation scheduling models\\nand controls, on new and improved sensor technology, and on integrating water quality constraints\\ninto irrigation scheduling and control. Technology transfer of irrigation scheduling information to\\nproducers needs to consider producers’ behavior and their actual on-farm needs.\\nKeywords: Drainage, Evaporation, Irrigation control/automation, Plant water status, Models,\\nRunoff, Soil water, Transpiration \\nINTRODUCTION\\nIrrigation scheduling was defined by Jensen (1981) as “a planning and decision-making\\nactivity that the farm manager or operator of an irrigated farm is involved in before and during\\nmost of the growing season for each crop that is grown.” This basic definition remains the typical\\nview of irrigation scheduling today. He further indicated four types of data needed for irrigation\\ndecision making:\\n1) “current level and expected change in available soil water for each field over the\\nnext 5 to 10 days;\\nPage 2\\nInformation\\nRetrivial\\nIrrigation\\nManagement\\nImplemention\\nPlan\\nData\\nIntegration\\nFIELD\\nPLOT\\nFARM\\nFigure 1. Irrigation Management Cycle.\\n2) current estimates of the probable latest date of the next irrigation on each field to\\navoid adverse effects of plant water stress; and the earliest date that the next\\nirrigation can be given to permit efficient irrigation with existing system;\\n3) the amount of water that should be applied to each field, if the irrigator is able to\\ncontrol or measure that amount, which will achieve high irrigation efficiency and\\nthe targeted soil water level; and\\n4) some indication of the adverse effects of irrigating a few days early or late, of\\napplying too little or too much water, or perhaps terminating the irrigations for the\\nseason.”\\nOther information or data needed to supplement the above are water costs, water supply capacity,\\nsoil salinity levels, agronomic or field management schedules, etc. A perusal of ASAE irrigation\\nscheduling and evapotranspiration conference proceedings from 1966 through this one\\ndemonstrates both the breadth of technology adapted to irrigation scheduling and the emphasis on\\nunderstanding the many interrelationships and complexities affecting crop water. But most\\nemphasis has been placed on field soil water status and earliest and latest irrigation dates (items #1\\nand #2) and sometimes the adverse effects of early or postponed irrigation are considered (item\\n#4). However, the efficient irrigation depth to apply (item #3) is often not considered to be an\\nirrigation scheduling decision but rather part of irrigation system design and operation. Neglect of\\nthe importance of this irrigation amount window (range in the efficient application amounts or item\\n#3) can lead to problems or failures in irrigation scheduling and control systems.\\nSince the early use of computers in modern scientific irrigation management (Jensen, 1969;\\nJensen et al., 1970 & 1971) and now with the myriad of ways available to measure many differing\\nsoil-water-plant-atmosphere parameters (Hanks and Brown, 1987; and Phene et al., 1990), most\\nof us have not fully utilized all the elements of this possible information to guide our irrigation\\ndecision making nor have many individuals developed the expertise and competency with this\\ndiverse range of instrumentation. Often, reliance is placed on only one system (such as a soil\\nwater balance model, soil water tension, soil water content, leaf water potential, canopy\\ntemperature, etc.) with little feedback on the range of other state variables in the soil-water-crop_x0002_atmosphere continuum. Irrigation scheduling, as outlined above, requires an extensive\\ninformation gathering system, data integration scheme, and a means to successfully implement the\\nirrigation management plan (Fig. 1). Irrigation scheduling itself is simply determining when and\\nhow much water to apply to meet a specified management objective. Yet the implementation of\\nirrigation scheduling information into an\\noperational irrigation plan is far more entailed\\nthan the above statement because many\\noutside factors (labor, harvesting, crop\\nculture, system maintenance, etc.) must be\\nconsidered as well.\\nI want to focus this paper on the state\\nof the on-farm irrigation scheduling\\nknowledge and where we have come in the\\npast 25 years or so, and then to discuss the\\nimpact that irrigation scheduling can have on\\nirrigation water use. Then, I will emphasize\\nsome areas to consider for future research and\\ntechnology transfer of irrigation scheduling\\ninformation. \\nPage 3\\nSTATE OF KNOWLEDGE\\nAlthough much information on irrigation scheduling has been published in the past 25\\nyears, few new fundamental theories to enhance our understanding of water management have\\nbeen presented. In fact, the diversity of information types and quality now available may lead to\\ngreater confusion rather than greater understanding unless advanced training or diverse experience\\nenables one to discern minor, but important, differences in data. But in 1996, especially where I\\nwork — the Texas High Plains — water conservation and irrigation management have never held\\nmore promise or preeminence in common everyday lives.\\nWeather Data and Reference Evapotranspiration (ET) \\nWeather station networks, like CIMIS (Snyder, 1983) in California and many others\\nincluding new ones like the Oklahoma Mesonet (Brock et al., 1995) provide direct information\\nthat can be used by media outlets (print, audio, and visual) which reach a broad grower network. \\nUnfortunately, understanding and assimilating this information and formulating implementation\\nstrategies to actually use the data remain major challenges to scientists, extension specialists,\\naction agency personnel, and consultants. \\n“ETp” information [potential evapotranspiration; the ETp\\n terminology has largely been\\nreplaced by ETr\\n for reference evapotranspiration] was routinely broadcast on radio and television\\nstations and published in the newspaper several years ago in California (and I’m sure many other\\nlocal media markets). Even now in the Texas High Plains, a region with not nearly enough water\\nto make many choices about what to do with it, we have radio and television broadcasts and\\nnewspaper columns about “PET” [potential evapotranspiration] and grass lawn water use\\nestimates. ASAE spearheaded efforts a few years ago to provide grass (lawn) evapotranspiration\\n(ET) values for urban irrigation scheduling on The Weather Channel© for national broadcasts\\n(Hoffman, 1994). \\n We can install an automated weather station, collect data, and be computing ET in a\\nrelatively short time (depending mainly on equipment delivery). Twenty-five years ago, it was a\\nmajor task to compute what we call “reference ET” (ETr ) today (i.e., Kincaid and Heermann,\\n1974). Weather station siting remains critical to acquiring high quality, representative data for\\ncomputing ET (Brown and Ley, 1993; Allen and Pruitt, 1986), and data verification methods and\\nalgorithms (see Allen, 1996; Meek and Hatfield, 1994) have improved substantially. Weather\\ninstruments must be maintained properly because erroneous data are difficult to detect even with\\ngood data screening techniques. Data measurement bias (either high or low) due to instrument\\ncalibrations are more difficult to detect and are more serious than random errors.\\nDespite almost 15 years of fairly robust and simple automated weather station use, little\\nhas been accomplished to standardize measurements, station siting, programming, data processing,\\nor data quality checking (Ley et al., 1994) despite repeated attempts by many groups. We know\\nthat it is best to site a station far from vertical obstructions, over irrigated grass whenever\\npossible, and in an area of adequate fetch, although how much fetch is still debated (Allen, 1996).\\nWe know that solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed data\\nalong with rainfall should be reported for daily periods, and hourly data are now preferred. But\\nthis knowledge has existed for almost 50 years (Penman, 1948). Van Bavel (1966) pointed out 30\\nyears ago out that the combination equation was better suited to instantaneous data (hourly or\\nshorter periods) than for daily averaged data. \\nPage 4\\nET ' Kc\\nETr\\n(1)\\nKc\\n' (Kcb Kw\\n) % Ks\\n(2)\\nSWi\\n' SW(i & 1)\\n& (ET % DP) % (IRRn\\n% Pn\\n) (3)\\nSince the 1980s (Burman et al., 1980), the preferred terminology is “reference ET” rather\\nthan “potential ET.” ASCE Manual No. 70 (Jensen et al., 1990) provides one of the best\\nsystematic discussions of ET and presents standardized methods for computing ETr\\n for common\\nreference crops of grass and alfalfa according to Allen et al. (1989). A complete description of\\nmethods to standardize the computation of grass reference ET is given by Allen et al. (1994b). \\nHowever, the theory on which the “best and most robust” ET calculations rests — the Penman_x0002_Monteith equation (Monteith, 1965) — was published 30 years ago, and more often it is simply\\nadapted rather than rigorously evaluated. However, the Penman-Monteith equation has been\\ngenerally the most stable form of the Penman combination ET equation used around the world. \\nMajor advances have occurred in measuring, calculating, and estimating ET using various\\nmethods. ET measurement should never be confused with ET calculation however. Only\\nlysimeters and eddy correlation methods actually measure ET while the other methods ‘estimate’\\nET as a residual term. Although not the central focus of my paper, these advances in using eddy\\ncorrelation systems, Bowen ratio energy balance systems, sap flow gauges to actually measure\\nplant transpiration, and time domain reflectometry (TDR) systems along with neutron probes to\\naccurately determine the soil water balance have all, except the neutron probe, become\\ncommercially available and far more reliable in the past quarter century. These advances have had\\na major impact on quality, availability, and costs for collecting the data for irrigation scheduling\\nmodels. \\nWater Balance Modeling \\nEvapotranspiration calculated using water balance models provided the first computer\\napplications for irrigation scheduling. Although many types of irrigation scheduling models are\\navailable (see Heermann, 1985; Heermann et al., 1990; Hill, 1991; Martin et al., 1990), many\\nhave features similar to the one described by Harrington and Heermann (1981) that compute ET\\nas:\\nand where the soil water balance between two dates (I-1 and I) is defined as\\nwhere ET is in mm, Kc\\n is the crop coefficient, ETr\\n is the in mm, Kcb is the basal crop coefficient\\n(Wright, 1982), Kw\\n is a water deficit parameter (depends on SW), Ks\\n is a soil wetness coefficient\\n(depends on IRRn\\n and Pn\\n), SW is soil water in mm, DP is deep percolation in mm beneath the root\\nzone (essentially depends on SW; note DP can be negative when ground water uptake occurs),\\nIRRn\\n is net irrigation in mm (net implies gross application less any field runoff and interception by\\ncanopy or residue covers), and Pn\\n is net rainfall in mm (net implies gross received less any runoff\\nand interception by canopy or residue covers). This water balance is one dimensional, and ETr\\n is\\ngenerally computed with a Penman combination equation or a Penman-Monteith equation (Allen et\\nal., 1989). Kcb is defined by ET from a crop with a dry soil surface (one or more days after\\nirrigation or rain depending on soil type) yet fully supplied with water. SW must be computed\\nover some root zone or soil profile depth. Several methods can be used to forecast ET based\\neither on long-term climate data or extrapolations of current ET rates (Heermann et al., 1990).\\nPage 5\\nCrop growth models calculate ET using methods similar to those outlined above, but often\\ncompute soil water evaporation (E) and crop transpiration (T) separately (Ritchie, 1972) for daily\\nperiods using leaf area index (LAI) to partition ET in the T and E components. Hanks (1991)\\ndemonstrated the development of Kc\\n values based on more detailed crop water-use models. Crop\\ngrowth models simulate the crop biomass and phenological developments along with its water use\\n(Jones and Ritchie, 1991), hence they have daily LAI values available for computing daily E and\\nT. Although some rather significant differences exist in the simpler Kc\\n and the crop growth model\\napproaches to estimating ET, essentially both are based on similar fundamental methodologies. \\nOne main difference is the time scaling of Kc\\n values versus the more dynamic E and T procedures\\nin the crop growth models based on LAI. LAI in many crop growth models is based on leaf\\nexpansion rates mainly derived from thermal units based on air temperatures (Ritchie and Johnson,\\n1990). Most Kc\\n values are scaled by percent of time to full cover and then days after full cover,\\npercent of total growing season length (days), polynomial equations based on time (either per cent\\nor days), or growing degree days (GDDs). Kc\\n values based on GDD scaling remove some\\nseasonal environmental effects on crop development when compared with Kc\\n values based solely\\non time or percent of “normal” growing season length (Amos et al., 1989). Since most crop\\ngrowth models essentially utilize the GDD concept in crop development, Kc\\n values based on the\\nGDD approach become similar to crop growth model dynamics based on the individual growing\\nseason environment. Another difference between the simpler Kc\\n and crop model approach is the\\ncomputation of Kw\\n. Many crop growth models consider irrigation as a water balance input, but\\nfew models utilize “realistic” irrigation constraints (like irrigation capacity or irrigation delivery \\nschedules). In addition, many crop growth models simply consider irrigations as “extra” rainfall\\nwithout considering the unique application differences for different forms of irrigation.\\nBoth of these types of water balance models (irrigation scheduling and crop growth) are\\nwell suited for irrigation scheduling since they provide a daily accounting of water and can project\\nseveral days forward to determine the earliest date to irrigate so the “available” soil water storage\\ncan “efficiently” store the irrigation amount and the latest date that an irrigation can be applied\\nand still avoid crop-water shortages. Of course, since these models are single point water balance\\nestimates, several model sets must be run simultaneously to simulate the field conditions of the\\nleading and trailing irrigation sets (i.e. the starting and stopping points on a pivot or the first and\\nlast surface set for furrow irrigation) (Martin et al., 1990; Hill, 1991; Heermann et al., 1990). \\nThe next irrigation date forecast can consider rainfall probabilities as well as anticipate larger ET\\nrates as the crop develops. However, irrigation scheduling using either ET or crop growth models \\nin very coarse soils where the available water holding capacity in the root zone is low, and\\ntherefore irrigations must be applied frequently, are less useful than direct soil or plant\\nmeasurements. Nevertheless, even in these cases, models can show longer-term trends not\\nimmediately apparent from manually observed parameters (soil or plant water status). Equally\\nimportant to tactical decisions within a season, ET and crop growth models can be used to study\\nlonger-term situations (Hill, 1991) to fine-tune irrigation management strategies and to examine\\nalternate economic scenarios. Both ET models and crop growth models are typically one\\ndimensional so they don’t consider the two-dimensional nature of irrigation and rainfall spatial\\nvariability, which can be more easily examined directly using either soil or plant water status\\nobservations. \\nPage 6\\nSoil Water Status\\nWe can measure soil water status (content and potential) and even salinity levels at points\\nin fields using electronic sensors which can be utilized with automated data acquisition methods\\nand integrated into irrigation control systems. Soil water measurement methods have been widely\\nreviewed (see Holmes et al., 1967; Haise and Hagan, 1967; Campbell and Mulla, 1990; Campbell\\nand Campbell, 1982; Gardner, 1986; Schmugge et al., 1980; Stafford, 1988; and Phene et al.,\\n1990). Four methods dominate irrigation management — gravimetric sampling, neutron\\nscattering, electrical resistance/capacitance, and soil water pressure (tensiometers). Gravimetric\\nsampling and the “feel” method remain the soil-water-measurement methods most widely used by\\ngrowers and consultants. Neutron scattering has remained mainly a research tool but has found\\nsome use by action agencies and consultants (Gear et al., 1977) for irrigation management. \\nElectrical resistance/granular matrix type sensors have remained one of the least expensive soil\\nwater measurement technologies applicable to producer use (Eldredge et al., 1993; and Thompson\\nand Armstrong, 1987). These and other types of soil water sensors have wide application for\\nirrigation scheduling and have been used successfully in automated control systems (see Youngner\\net al., 1981; Phene et al., 1989; and Phene and Howell, 1984; for a few examples). Time domain\\nreflectometry (TDR) (Topp et al., 1980) provides a portable means to measure soil water contents\\nand bulk electrical conductivity. Topp and Davis (1985) discuss the application of TDR to\\nirrigation management and even present an idea for using TDR to control irrigation; however,\\nTDR remains expensive, making it mainly suitable for research or use by trained consultants. Soil\\nwater measurements are useful for verifying ET models and for triggering or halting irrigations,\\nbut they are not extremely useful in forecasting the near future need for irrigation. The scheduler\\nor controller must activate the irrigation based on the current soil water state, so this ‘activation\\npoint’ or control level must permit irrigation in time to avoid yield affecting water deficits. Soil\\nwater sensors are effective in triggering demand irrigations or ‘over-riding’ pre-set irrigations (i.e.\\nwhen the soil may be sufficiently wet from prior irrigations and/or recent rains).\\nSoil water measurements are necessary for feedback information on irrigation scheduling\\nbased on ET. Since practically all models are unreliable in predicting many water balance\\ncomponents (and some components may even be ignored), it is desirable that field samples or\\nmeasurements of soil water be periodically acquired to “adjust” model output for irrigation\\napplication and rainfall infiltration differences. Soil water sensor measurements made near the\\nbottom of the root zone can be useful in indicating when irrigations are resulting in excessive deep\\npercolation above salinity management requirements. \\nPlant Water Status\\nPlant water status has remained one of the more difficult parameters to measure\\nelectronically. Phene et al. (1990) describes many of the more widely used plant water status\\nmeasurements. Sap flow measurements of transpiration using both steady state heat flux\\n(Sakuratani, 1981 and Baker and van Bavel, 1987) or heat-pulse technology (Cohen et al., 1981)\\nremain a promising method for automating irrigation control based on direct physical plant\\nmeasurements. Yet, many problems such as sampling, range of instruments needed for a\\ncomplete crop season (differing stem sizes), or sensor movement from plant to plant, besides the\\nphysical problems of instrumentation, remain to make sap flow gauges mainly useful for research\\nat this time. In the 1980s, widespread optimism developed with a new technology to “remotely”\\nsense crop (or plant) temperature (Jackson et al., 1980). Infrared thermometers (IRTs) became\\nPage 7\\ncommercially available that were portable, stable in a wide range of ambient temperatures, and\\neasy to use. These devices and their use in detecting crop water deficits were widely studied in\\nthe 1980s and 1990s. Yet, precise measurement of crop temperature by itself was not useful\\nwithout supplementary environmental data rendering the technique difficult to apply from satellites\\nas originally envisioned. But simple crop temperature measurements using IRTs with some\\nreliance on environmental data for irrigation control (Wanjura et al., 1995) can be used directly in\\ncontrol methods. Measurements of plant water status often do not provide sufficient lead time to\\nschedule irrigations while avoiding yield-affecting crop water deficits and often don’t respond\\nquick enough to terminate irrigations. \\nDirect measures of plant water status can be used like soil water measurements in\\nconjunction with ET models to provide feedback data on crop water deficits. They can also be\\nparticularly useful in irrigation scheduling where salinity in the ground water may cause sudden\\ncrop water deficits despite having near ‘adequate’ root zone soil water amounts. However, crop\\nwater measurements are more useful in the drier range where crop water deficits begin to reduce \\nyield than in the wetter range where ‘over-irrigation’ cause excessive DP. They can also be useful\\nin locating parts of a field that may be suffering from water shortages caused by irrigation\\noperation or by soil differences.\\nIrrigation Control/Automation\\nAutomated control of irrigation requires the use of either soil, crop, or environmental\\nsensors to determine the need for irrigation (see Youngner et al., 1981; Phene et al., 1990;\\nZazueta and Smajstrala, 1992; Singh et al., 1995; or Wanjura et al., 1995 for some examples )\\nand then either a logic-type controller or a computer to control the irrigation sequence. The\\ncontroller may need to use various control modules to properly manage the irrigation system. \\nThese control modules might measure pressure and/or flow or other parameters at selected points\\nand control pumps, filters, chemical injectors, etc. (Duke et al., 1990). It is important for\\ncontrollers to have “fall-back” or safety shut down modes as well. Most control systems are\\ndesigned for unattended operation with periodic operator intervention. Irrigation control using soil\\nor plant water sensors suffers from sensor location and field placement limitations.\\nIrrigation management automation can reduce peak electric loads (Stetson et al., 1975) in\\naddition to just making irrigation decisions. Since in many areas power costs are the main costs\\nfor irrigation, they represent one way to impact irrigation costs directly. Duke et al. (1984),\\nBuchleiter et al. (1984), and Heermann et al. (1984) described an integrated center pivot control\\nsystem that utilized radio communication between pivots, pumps, and the controller to reduce\\nenergy and water use. The system was evaluated for three years (Buchleiter and Heermann, 1986)\\non a farm in north central Oregon with over 4,000 ha and 15 center pivots with four pumping\\nstations. It was effective in controlling irrigations, pivots, and pumps to the satisfaction of the\\nproducer. They reported that for two years of the three-year test the producer participated in a\\nload control program and received a 14% reduction in power cost and had an annual savings of\\n$1,000. \\nIMPACT OF WATER MANAGEMENT ON WATER USE\\nIrrigation management, by its very definition, must affect or control water use as it relates\\nto irrigation. However, direct comparisons of management systems are seldom without bias. One\\nof the most critical biases can occur when selecting the base for comparison. Typically, the base\\nPage 8\\nIRR\\ng\\n'\\nSW\\nps\\n& SWph % E % T & Pn\\nIRRe\\n% L (4)\\nmay be a historical one determined by the past use of water on a particular farm, field, or larger\\nscale entity (district, basin, etc.) or one that is deemed the “standard” for a concurrent (side-by_x0002_side) comparison. It remains challenging to determine influences from annual and longer term\\nclimatic influences on water use and to separate or account for them in the historical base water\\nuse. The concurrent trial method compares some “improved” water management system with\\nanother “standard” water management system which is judged to be a fair level of comparison. \\nSeldom do many studies use similar “standards” since these are locally dependent on crop and soil\\nconditions. Since the application of irrigation management technology is an “education and\\nextension” activity, it is also difficult to “isolate” the grower from knowing or seeing what the\\ntrial method may be doing. Often these observations can confuse and bias any comparisons. \\nAlthough irrigation management comparisons can be made for a wide range of systems, it is often\\ndifficult to separate management decision effects from those of actual irrigation system operation\\ndecisions that affect uniformity and application efficiency. Common irrigation scheduling\\ncomparisons involve crop yield and/or economics as well. It is important to recognize that yield is\\ninfluenced by many factors besides irrigation management. \\nSources of Water Savings\\nIrrigation scheduling can reduce irrigation water use only by reducing runoff from either\\nirrigation or rainfall, by decreasing percolation of water beneath the root zone in excess of any\\nrequired leaching for salinity management, by reducing soil water evaporation after an irrigation,\\nor by controlling soil water depletion in a manner that reduces ET during known non-sensitive\\ncrop growth stages. In some cases, irrigation scheduling may actually increase irrigation water\\nuse, while concurrently increasing crop yield by avoiding critical soil water deficits that reduce\\ncrop yield or by suppling both water and nutrients needed by the crop at a more “optimum” time\\nfor the particular crop. Essentially, these “savings” or “increases” in water use can be examined\\nin terms of the water balance presented by Eq. (3). In fact, it is more illustrative to separate ET\\ninto its components and express the seasonal irrigation requirement as follows:\\nwhere IRRg\\n is “gross” irrigation amount in mm, SWps is pre-season soil water in mm (i.e. before\\nany pre-plant irrigations), SWph is post-harvest soil water in mm, Pn\\n here is the growing season\\n‘effective’ net precipitation in mm, IRRe\\n is the mean application efficiency (fraction), and L\\nrepresents deep percolation required for salinity management in mm (i.e. L includes any DP from\\nirrigation and/or rainfall). Equation 4 illustrates areas where water savings can occur. Obviously,\\nIRRe\\n must high in order to minimize IRRg\\n; however, IRRe\\n will vary considerably from irrigation\\nto irrigation and is highly dependent on the irrigation method. Irrigation scheduling attempts to\\nmaintain SW above some “critical” level, below which yields may be decreased, and below some\\n“threshold” level, above which rainfall capture is reduced by increased runoff (maximizing\\nstorage for Pn\\n) or above which DP is increased (above that necessary for salinity management)\\nsuch that SWt $ SW $ SWc\\n where SWt\\n and SWc\\n are the “threshold” and “critical” soil water\\ndepletion levels. The allowable soil water depletion (SWt\\n- SWc\\n) is called management allowed\\ndepletion (MAD) and is a function of soil type and crop. The MAD concept requires that MAD\\nbe considerably larger than the maximum daily ET rate. In areas with coarse soils and limited\\nroot zone water holding capacity, the MAD concept is not extremely useful. The goal of\\nirrigation scheduling and irrigation management is usually to maximize T, since T is so closely\\nPage 9\\nassociated with dry matter production and thereby economic yield, subject to water supply and\\nother economic constraints. If T is maximized subject to the water supply and economic\\nconstraints, then it is likely that water use efficiency (yield per unit ET or yield per unit T) will\\nalso be near maximum too. It is common for yield per unit T (or ET) to remain nearly constant\\nfor a wide range of T; i.e. yield is nearly proportional to T (or ET). \\nIrrigation scheduling cannot achieve significant water savings by reducing T without\\nreducing yield and thereby, perhaps, reducing profit too. Irrigation scheduling effects on water\\nsavings by reducing E are less straight forward. E can be reduced by extending periods between\\nsoil wetting. However, in humid and sub-humid climates and even in many semi-arid climates\\nthis dry period length is often determined by rainfall more than irrigation interval. Since rainfall\\ncan’t be controlled and neither can it be forecast very accurately, it remains difficult to see where\\nsubstantial savings can be made in E simply by scheduling alone (application methods may be a\\nlarger factor on E). Perhaps in more arid areas with Mediterranean type climates (low summer\\nrainfall), irrigation scheduling (irrigation frequency and irrigation application depth) might affect\\nE more consistently. E can be minimized by increasing the maximum irrigation interval\\nconstrained by the maximum “efficient” application amount and by the irrigation capacity. It is\\nobvious that irrigation delivery schedules that are too frequent or rigidly constrained (e.g. fixed\\nrotations) can result in inefficient use of water. Small savings in water may be possible by\\nstaggering the irrigations in slightly uneven day periods (12-h offsets) so that the same area of the\\nfield is not irrigated at exactly the same time of day on each irrigation cycle. This is more\\ncommon with center pivots where rotations are set for a time period not evenly divisible by 24 h.\\n Any significant savings in water must come from maximizing Pn\\n while reducing DP to only\\nthat necessary for leaching. The importance of P capture and DP reduction will depend on the\\nspecific hydrology of the site. In the Great Plains, P is highly erratic and unpredictable, but P can\\nbe a substantial component of total T while DP is of less concern in many cases. So, in this\\nregion, irrigation scheduling attempts to maximize Pn\\n to achieve a high T, amount while reducing\\nIRRg\\n. In more arid climates, DP becomes the over-riding parameter because P is relatively\\nminor. In sub-humid and humid climates, both Pn\\n and DP are more important for irrigation\\nmanagement decisions. As water quality issues become increasingly important constraints, both\\nDP and runoff must be recognized and managed to avoid agro-chemical, sediment, and nutrient\\ntransport from the field to any water body (either ground water or surface water).\\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH\\nBefore anyone considers new extensive irrigation management or irrigation scheduling\\nresearch, the article by Marvin Shearer and James Vomocil (Shearer and Vomocil, 1981) should\\nbe required reading. They stated, “behavioral patterns and value judgements of growers may have\\nbeen the dominant cause for lack of sustained adoption of modern irrigation scheduling,” as they\\nsurveyed educational efforts at technology transfer in irrigation scheduling in Oregon over a 25-\\nyear period. They recommend that successful (long-term and self-sustaining) technology transfer\\nmust consider the human behavior aspects since the behavioral patterns and attitudes of people\\nwere more important than having convenient, accurate, or reliable irrigation scheduling methods. \\nWorld-wide irrigation expansion has slowed considerably (Higgins et al., 1988), and in the U.S.,\\ntrends are for decreased number of irrigated farms and irrigated area (Franklin and Narayanan,\\n1988).

The main plant-based methods for irrigation scheduling, including those based on direct or indirect measurement of plant water status and those based on plant physiological responses to drought, are outlined and evaluated. Specific plant-based methods include the use of dendrometry, fruit gauges, and other tissue water content sensors, while measurements of growth, sap flow, and stomatal conductance are also outlined. Recent advances, especially in the use of infrared thermometry and thermography for the study of stomatal conductance changes, are highlighted. The relative suitabilities of different approaches for specific crop and climatic situations are discussed, with the aim of indicating the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, and highlighting their suitability over different spatial and temporal scales.

In many ways irrigation scheduling can be regarded as a mature research field which has moved from innovative science into the realms of use, or at most the refinement, of existing practical applications. Nevertheless, in recent years there has been a wide range of proposed novel approaches to irrigation scheduling which have not yet been widely adopted; many of these are based on sensing the plant response to water deficits rather than sensing the soil moisture status directly (Jones, 1990a).\\n\\nThe increasing worldwide shortages of water and costs of irrigation are leading to an emphasis on developing methods of irrigation that minimize water use (maximize the water use efficiency). The advent of precision irrigation methods such as trickle irrigation has played a major role in reducing the water required in agricultural and horticultural crops, but has highlighted the need for new methods of accurate irrigation scheduling and control. In recent years it has become clear that maintenance of a slight plant water deficit can improve the partitioning of carbohydrate to reproductive structures such as fruit and also control excessive vegetative growth (Chalmers et al., 1981), giving rise to what has been termed by Chalmers et al. (1986) as ‘regulated deficit irrigation’ (RDI). Achievement of successful RDI depends on accurate soil moisture or plant ‘stress’ sensing, and requires an ability to irrigate ‘little and often’ on demand. A disadvantage of RDI is that it requires water status to be maintained accurately within a rather narrow tolerance; any excess application loses the advantage of the regulated deficit and can cost more in terms of water used, while any under-application can lead to severe yield or quality losses. An alternative recent innovation to achieve the same measure of growth control has been the development of partial root-zone drying (PRD), where irrigation is supplied alternately to different parts of the root system (Dry and Loveys, 1998; Stoll et al., 2000b). A potential advantage of this method is that precise irrigation control is probably less critical for success than it is for RDI, as plants can always obtain adequate water from the well-watered side of the root system and the drying side primarily provides a signal to modify growth and stomatal aperture (Stoll et al., 2000a).\\n\\nThe range of crops to which RDI and PRD methods have been applied is increasing all the time, but their greatest successes have been in high-value horticultural and fruit crops, usually those where the harvested part of the plant is its reproductive organ. Applications of such techniques to extensive arable crops are in their infancy, although there are some exciting preliminary reports (Kang et al., 2000, 2003). At present it is much less clear whether PRD or RDI would be so valuable for vegetative crops, although appropriate application can be used to restrict growth, as is required for high quality in some ornamental crop species (RS Harrison-Murray, personal communication).\\n\\nThe choice of irrigation scheduling method depends to a large degree on the objectives of the irrigator and the irrigation system available. The more sophisticated scheduling methods generally require higher-precision application systems; nevertheless even less sophisticated systems such as flood irrigation scheduling can benefit from improvements in irrigation scheduling as outlined here. The pressures to improve irrigation use efficiency and to use irrigation for precise control of vegetative growth, as in RDI, both imply a requirement for increased precision in irrigation control, maintaining the soil moisture status within fine bands to achieve specific objectives in crop management. Such objectives can only be met by precision irrigation systems such as trickle irrigation that can apply precise amounts of water at frequent intervals (often several times per day). Effective operation of such systems equally requires a sensing system that determines irrigation need in real time or at least at frequent intervals; this rules out large-scale manual monitoring programmes for such purposes and indicates a need for automated monitoring systems.\\n\\nBasics of irrigation scheduling\\nThe main methods that are used for irrigation scheduling, or that have the potential for development in the near future, are summarized in Table 1. Irrigation scheduling is conventionally based either on ‘soil water measurement’, where the soil moisture status (whether in terms of water content or water potential) is measured directly to determine the need for irrigation, or on ‘soil water balance calculations’, where the soil moisture status is estimated by calculation using a water balance approach in which the change in soil moisture (Δθ) over a period is given by the difference between the inputs (irrigation plus precipitation) and the losses (runoff plus drainage plus evapotranspiration). Soil moisture measurement techniques have been the subject of many texts and reviews (Smith and Mullins, 2000; Dane and Topp, 2002) and will not be addressed here. Similarly, the detailed methods for estimating evapotranspiration and calculation of crop water requirements for different crops and different climates, as required in the water balance calculation, have been reviewed in detail by Allen et al. (1999). Although the water balance approach is not very accurate, it has generally been found to be sufficiently robust under a wide range of conditions. Nevertheless it is subject to the serious problem that errors are cumulative over time. For this reason it is often necessary to recalibrate the calculated water balance at intervals by using actual soil measurements, or sometimes plant response measurements (as outlined below). Some of the main advantages and disadvantages of the different irrigation scheduling approaches are outlined in Table 1.\\n\\nTable 1.A summary of the main classes of irrigation scheduling approaches, indicating their main advantages and disadvantages\\nAdvantages\\nDisadvantages\\nI. Soil water measurement\\t\\t\\n(a) Soil water potential (tensiometers, psychrometers, etc.)\\tEasy to apply in practice; can be quite precise; at least water content measures indicate ‘how much’ water to apply; many commercial systems available; some sensors (especially capacitance and time domain sensors) readily automated\\tSoil heterogeneity requires many sensors (often expensive) or extensive monitoring programme (e.g. neutron probe); selecting position that is representative of the root-zone is difficult; sensors do not generally measure water status at root surface (which depends on evaporative demand)\\n(b) Soil water content (gravimetric; capacitance/TDR; neutron probe)\\t\\t\\nII.

The actual tissue water potential at any time therefore depends both on the soil moisture status and on the rate of water flow through the plant and the corresponding hydraulic flow resistances between the bulk soil and the appropriate plant tissues. The plant response to a given amount of soil moisture therefore varies as a complex function of evaporative demand. As a result it has been suggested (Jones, 1990a) that greater precision in the application of irrigation can potentially be obtained by a third approach, the use of ‘plant “stress” sensing’. For this approach irrigation scheduling decisions are based on plant responses rather than on direct measurements of soil water status; some of the possible physiological measurements and responses that can be used are discussed in the following section.\\n\\nPlant-based methods for irrigation control\\nIntroduction\\nIf soil water-based measures are to be replaced by plant-based measures it is important to consider what measures might be most appropriate for irrigation scheduling purposes. Possible measures include direct measurements of some aspect of plant water status as well as measurements of a number of plant processes that are known to respond sensitively to water deficits. One might expect that a direct measure of plant water status should be the most rigorous and hence the most useful indicator of irrigation requirement, although the question remains as to where in the plant that quantity should be measured. In practice, as has been argued strongly by Jones (1990b), most plants exercise some measure of autonomous control over their shoot or leaf water status, tending to minimize changes in shoot water status as the soil dries or as evaporative demand increases (Bates and Hall, 1981; Jones, 1983). In the long term, this control is achieved through changes in leaf area and root extension, and in the shorter term through changes in leaf angle, stomatal conductance, and hydraulic properties of the transport system. In extreme cases, plants with good endogenous control systems maintain a stable leaf water status over a wide range of evaporative demand or soil water supplies; these plants are termed ‘isohydric’ (Stocker, 1956), and include especially plants such as cowpea, maize, and poplar (Bates and Hall, 1981; Tardieu and Simonneau, 1998). This is by contrast with those species such as sunflower or barley which appear to have less effective control of leaf water status and have been termed ‘anisohydric’. In practice the distinctions between isohydric and anisohydric behaviour are often not clear-cut; even different cultivars of grapevine have been shown to have contrasting hydraulic behaviours (Schultz, 2003).\\n\\nThe choice of which plant-based measure to use depends on their relative sensitivity to water deficits. The definition of sensitivity, however, is somewhat problematic. The relative sensitivities of different physiological processes were reviewed in some detail by Hsiao (1973), who identified cell growth as being most sensitive to tissue water deficits, closely followed by wall and protein synthesis, all of which could respond to water deficits of less than 0.1 MPa (Fig. 1). Hsiao reported that stomatal closure was only rarely affected when tissue water potential fell by 0.2–0.5 MPa, with decreases of 1.0 MPa or more being required for stomatal closure in many cases. Although photosynthesis was classified as moderately sensitive by Hsiao, largely as a result of its dependence on stomatal aperture, some component processes such as electron transport are now known to be particularly insensitive (Massacci and Jones, 1990). It is now believed that Hsiao's (1973) classification is somewhat misleading, and underestimates the true sensitivity of the stomata, as it is based on observed responses to leaf water potential alone and ignores the internal root–shoot signalling that is now known to play a major part in controlling stomatal aperture (Davies and Zhang, 1991).\\n\\nFig. 1.\\nGeneralized sensitivities of plant processes to water deficits (modified with permission from Hsiao, 1973).\\nOpen in new tabDownload slide\\nGeneralized sensitivities of plant processes to water deficits (modified with permission from Hsiao, 1973).\\n\\nThe error arising from a reliance on leaf water status is readily apparent when one considers that many plants operate when optimally watered with the leaf water potential at around −2 MPa, yet the stomata may close as the soil dries by only a few tens of Pa, with little change in leaf water potential (Bates and Hall, 1981). A further consideration is that any attempt to relate stomatal aperture to leaf water potential in a long-term drought experiment can also be misleading, because with slowly developing stress the plant adapts by decreasing leaf area; as a result stomatal conductance and photosynthesis rate per unit leaf area may remain fairly stable as soil dries (Moriana and Fereres, 2002). Nevertheless, over shorter time-scales it still appears that stomata are a particularly sensitive early indicator of water deficits.\\n\\nIn principle, water status is not ideal as a measure of water deficit as it is already subject to some physiological control, and indeed, as has been outlined above, leaf water potential generally shows some homeostasis. Nevertheless, changes in water status somewhere in the plant system are assumed to be a prerequisite for any physiological adaptation or other response. All that a homeostatic system can do is to minimize, not eliminate, the changes in water status; indeed for a feedback system of stomatal control it is not theoretically possible for such a system to stably eliminate changes in shoot water status if that is the variable that actually controls the stomata (Jones, 1990b; Franks et al., 1997).\\n\\nIn general, the use of any plant-based or similar indicator for irrigation scheduling requires the definition of reference or threshold values, beyond which irrigation is necessary (Table 1). Such reference values are commonly determined for plants growing under non-limiting soil water supply (Fereres and Goldhamer, 2003), but obtaining extensive information on the behaviour of these reference values as environmental conditions change is an important stage in the development and validation of such methods. Another general limitation to plant-based methods is that they do not usually give information on ‘how much’ irrigation to apply at any time, only whether or not irrigation is needed.\\n\\nPlant water status\\nPerhaps the first approach to the use of the plant itself as an indicator of irrigation need, and one that is still frequently adopted today, was to base irrigation on visible wilting. Unfortunately, by the time wilting is apparent a substantial proportion of potential yield may already have been lost (Slatyer, 1967). More rigorous and more sensitive measures of plant water status are therefore required. Although relative water content (RWC) (Barrs, 1968) is a widely used measure of water status that does not require sophisticated equipment, it is often argued that water potential, especially of the leaves (ψleaf) is a more rigorous and more generally applicable measure of plant water status (Slatyer, 1967; Jones, 1990b). In spite of this, RWC has the advantage that it can be more closely related to cell turgor, which is the process directly driving cell expansion, than it is to the total water potential (Jones, 1990b).\\n\\nThe fact that plant water status, and especially leaf water status, is usually controlled to some extent by means of stomatal closure or other regulatory mechanisms, argues against the use of such measures, especially in strongly isohydric species. A further problem with the use of leaf water status as an indicator of irrigation need was pointed out by Jones (1990b), who noted that even though there was often homeostasis of leaf water potential between different soil moisture regimes, rapid temporal fluctuations are often observed as a function of environmental conditions (such as passing clouds). This makes the interpretation of leaf water potential as an indicator of irrigation-need doubly unsatisfactory. Nevertheless, in spite of the concerns with the use of leaf water status that have been outlined above, it has been reported that leaf water potential can, when corrected for diurnal and environmental variation, provide a sensitive index for irrigation control (Peretz et al., 1984).\\n\\nAs a partial solution to the variability of leaf water status, various workers have proposed that a more useful and more robust indicator of water status is the xylem water potential or stem water potential (SWP, measured by using a pressure chamber on leaves enclosed in darkened plastic bags for some time before measurement and allowed to equilibrate with the xylem water potential; McCutchan and Shackel, 1992). As a more stable measure of water status, others have even recommended that measurements should be made on pre-equilibrated leaves from root suckers (Jones, 1990a; Simonneau and Habib, 1991). These methods are thought to be preferable largely because they approach more closely the soil water status than does the value of leaf water potential, although as a result they therefore miss out on the potential advantages of plant-based methods.\\n\\nPerhaps an even better estimator of the soil water potential is the predawn leaf water potential (as ψleaf should largely equilibrate with ψsoil by dawn). Unfortunately this is often found to be rather insensitive to variation in soil moisture content (Garnier and Berger, 1987). Further, this is not very convenient for irrigation scheduling as routine measurements predawn are expensive to obtain, and at best can only be obtained daily. As yet another alternative, Jones (1983) suggested the indirect estimation of an effective soil water potential at the root surface of transpiring plants based on measurements of leaf water potential and stomatal conductance during the day, and argued that this should have significant advantages over predawn measurements. Such an approach has been successfully tested by Lorenzo-Minguez et al. (1985).\\n\\nNone of the above plant-based methods are well adapted for automation of irrigation scheduling or control because of the difficulties of measurement of any of the variables discussed. Although it may be possible to use automated stem or leaf psychrometers (Dixon and Tyree, 1984), these instruments are notoriously unreliable. In conclusion, it is apparent from the above discussion that the favoured way to use plant water status is actually as an indicator of soil water status; this negates many of the advantages of selecting a plant-based measure! Indeed soil water potential can be measured directly, thus avoiding the need for any plant-based measurement, although it is worth noting that this does not necessarily give a good measure of the effective water potential at the root surface during active transpiration (Jones, 1983).\\n\\nSeveral indirect methods for measuring or monitoring water status have been developed as alternatives to direct measurement. The general behaviour of a number of such methods have been compared by McBurney (1992) and Sellés and Berger (1990). In general, these indirect methods suffer from the same disadvantages as do the direct measurements of leaf water status, but in certain circumstances have been developed into commercial systems. Some of these approaches are reviewed below.\\n\\nLeaf thickness:\\nA number of instruments are available for the routine monitoring of leaf thickness, which is known to decrease as turgidity decreases. Approaches include direct measurement using linear displacement transducers (e.g. LVDTs [Burquez, 1987; Malone, 1993] or capacitance sensors [McBurney, 1992]) or through measurements of leaf ‘superficial density’ using β-ray attenuation (Jones, 1973). Unfortunately, leaf thickness is frequently even less sensitive to changes in water status than is leaf water content because, especially with younger leaves, a fraction of leaf shrinkage is often in the plane of the leaves rather than in the direction of the sensor (Jones, 1973).\\n\\nStem and fruit diameter:\\nStem and fruit diameters fluctuate diurnally in response to changes in water content, and so suffer from many of the same disadvantages as other water status measures. Nevertheless, the diurnal dynamics of changes in diameter, especially of fruits, have been used to derive rather more sensitive indicators of irrigation need, where the magnitude of daily shrinkage has been used to indicate water status, and comparisons of diameters at the same time on succeeding days give a measure of growth rate (Huguet et al., 1992; Li and Huguet, 1990; Jones, 1985). Although changes in growth rate provide a particularly sensitive measure of plant water stress, such daily measurements are not particularly useful for the control of high-frequency irrigation systems. Nevertheless, several workers have achieved promising results for low-frequency irrigation scheduling by the use of maximum daily shrinkage (MDS). For example, Fereres and Goldhamer (2003) showed that MDS was a more promising approach for automated irrigation scheduling than was the use of stem water potential for almond trees, while differences in maximum trunk diameter were also found to be particularly useful in olive (Moriana and Fereres, 2002). The use of such dendrometry or micromorphometric techniques has been developed into a number of successful commercial irrigation scheduling systems (e.g. ‘Pepista 4000’, Delta International, Montfavet, France); these are usually applied to the study of stem diameter changes. Sellés and Berger (1990) reported that variations in trunk diameter or stem water potential were more sensitive as indicators of irrigation need than was the variation in fruit diameter. This was probably a result of the poor hydraulic connection between fruit tissue and the conducting xylem. There is currently much interest in evaluating such techniques for irrigation scheduling, with a number of relevant papers presented at recent meetings (e.g. the International Society for Horticultural Science 4th International Symposium on Irrigation of Horticultural Crops, 1–5 September 2003, Davis, CA, USA [as yet unpublished], and Kang et al., 2003).\\n\\nγ-ray attenuation:\\nA related approach to the study of changes in stem water content was the use of γ-ray attenuation (Brough et al., 1986). Although this was shown to be very sensitive, safety considerations and cost have largely limited the further application of this approach.\\n\\nSap flow\\nThe development of reliable heat pulse and energy balance thermal sensors for sap-flow measurement in the stems of plants (Granier, 1987; Cohen et al., 1981; Cermak and Kucera, 1981) has opened up an alternative approach to irrigation scheduling based on measurements of sap-flow rates. Because sap-flow rates are expected to be sensitive to water deficits and especially to stomatal closure, many workers have tested the use of sap-flow measurement for irrigation scheduling and control in a diverse range of crops, including grapevine (Eastham and Gray, 1998; Ginestar et al., 1998a, b), fruit and olive trees (Ameglio et al., 1998; Fernandez et al., 2001; Giorio and Giorio, 2003; Remorini and Massai, 2003) and even greenhouse crops (Ehret et al., 2001).\\n\\nAlthough the changes in transpiration rate that sap flow indicates are largely determined by changes in stomatal aperture, transpiration is also influenced by other environmental conditions such as humidity. Therefore changes in sap flow can occur without changes in stomatal opening. Even though rates of sap flow may vary markedly between trees as a result of differences in tree size and exposure, the general patterns of change in response to both environmental conditions and to water status are similar (Eastham and Gray, 1998). Appropriate sap-flow rates to use as ‘control thresholds’ may be derived by means of regular calibration measurements, especially for larger trees. Alternatively, it is at least feasible in principle to derive an irrigation scheduling algorithm that is based on an analysis of the diurnal patterns of sap flow, with midday reductions being indicative of developing water deficits (though of course diurnal fluctuations in environmental conditions can mimic such changes). Another potential problem with sap flow for precision control is that it tends to lag behind changes in transpiration rate owing to the hydraulic capacitance of the stem and other plant tissues (Wronski et al., 1985).\\n\\nIt follows that, although sap-flow measurement is well adapted for automated recording and hence potentially automated control of irrigation systems, it can be a little difficult to determine the correct control points for any crop.\\n\\nXylem cavitation\\nIt is generally accepted (Steudle, 2001) that water in the xylem vessels of transpiring plants is under tension; as water deficits increase, this tension is thought to increase to such an extent that the water columns can fracture, or ‘cavitate’. Such cavitation events lead to the explosive formation of a bubble, initially containing water vapour. These cavitation events can be detected acoustically in the audio- (Milburn, 1979) or ultrasonic-frequencies (Tyree and Dixon, 1983), and the resulting embolisms may restrict water flow through the stem. Substantial evidence, though largely circumstantial, now indicates that the ultrasonic acoustic emissions (AEs) detected as plants become stressed do indeed indicate cavitation events and that AE rates can be used as an indicator of plant ‘stress’ (Tyree and Sperry, 1989). Nevertheless, there remain many uncertainties as it seems that at least a proportion of the AEs detected as woody tissues dry out may not be related to xylem embolisms. For example, the large numbers observed by Sandford and Grace (1985) as coniferous stems dried out were substantially in excess of the number of conducting tracheids present, thus suggesting a major contribution to observed AEs by the non-conducting fibres (Jones and Peña, 1986). Although the measurement of AEs has proved to be a powerful tool for the study of hydraulic architecture in plants, there has been little progress in adapting this measure as an indicator for irrigation scheduling. Note, however, the recent report by Yang et al. (2003), who implemented a control algorithm based on the association of AE rate with transpiration rate for the precision irrigation of tomato. It is likely that the main reasons for the lack of uptake include the fact that the relationship between the number of AEs and water status changes with successive cycles of stress, and the fact that cavitation events are mostly observed during the drying phase, not during rewetting, and so cannot provide an indicator of when irrigation has been sufficient to replenish the soil water supply.\\n\\nStomatal conductance and thermal sensing\\nAs outlined above, it appears that changes in stomatal conductance are particularly sensitive to developing water deficits in many plants and therefore potentially provide a good indicator of irrigation need in many species. It is in this area that most effort has been concentrated on the development of practical, plant-based irrigation scheduling approaches. Although stomatal conductance can be measured accurat\", 'unique_identifier': 29}\n",

Under higher pressure over natural resources, environmental concerns are increasing as well, challenging current water use decision-making processes in irrigated agriculture. Higher agricultural productivity means water should be applied more efficiently, which requires instant information on weather, soil, and plant conditions throughout the growing season. An information-based irrigation scheduling application tightened to the spatiotemporal variability of the fields is critical for enhancing the current irrigation system and making better irrigation scheduling decisions. The aim of this study is to review current irrigation scheduling methodologies based on two case studies (woody and field crops) located in semi-arid areas of Southeast Spain. We realize that optimal irrigation programming requires consistent investment in equipment, expenditure on operation and maintenance, and qualified technical and maintenance services. These technological approaches will be worthwhile in farms with low water availability, high profitability, and significant technical-economic capacity.\\nKeywords: water profitability; water scarcity; sensors; big data; information and communication technologies; irrigation scheduling\\n1. Introduction\\nA growing international population and rising living standards are increasing the demand for agricultural products. At the same time, globalization, markets liberalization, growing pressure on natural resources, and environmental concerns are heightening the need for improved agricultural productivity [1,2].\\nIn the case of irrigated agriculture, meeting this requirement involves a paradigm shift. Maximizing net profits will demand a more economic approach than simply maximizing crop yields. This is significantly complex and challenging, requiring that water be applied in a wiser, more precise, and accurate fashion because the margin for error narrows [3].\\nFrom an engineering standpoint, achieving the above depends on having more information, using enhanced irrigation systems and making better irrigation scheduling decisions. Instant information is required for a thorough understanding of weather, soil, and plant conditions throughout the growing season. Enhanced irrigation systems are needed for a uniform application of water depths tailored to the spatiotemporal variability of the fields. Better decisions are necessary to convert these capacities into profits.\\nThe scientific community and industry work to meet these needs, taking advantage of geolocated and internet-enabled devices. As a result, a wide range of technologies has been developed. Multiple sensors for weather, soil and plant measurements can supply data continuously and automatically in fixed points located within the field. Weather conditions, soil moisture and temperature, plant sap flow, trunk diameter, and leaf turgor pressure are some of the variables monitored by these sensors [4,5].\\nData can also be obtained for the whole field area. Remote and proximal sensing based on radar and spectral sensors onboard satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles, tractors and even centre-pivots and linear-moving irrigation systems allow high spatial and/or temporal resolution monitoring of soil moisture and plant water and nutrient status. Proximal electromagnetic induction sensors can also be used for mapping soil properties along with soil sampling and testing [6,7,8].\\nHigh quality equipment for water application has also been developed. If adequately selected and dimensioned modern irrigation systems can provide excellent performance under a wide range of environmental conditions. Furthermore, variable rate technology enables the application of site-specific water depths according to the spatial variability of the soil and plant conditions throughout the field [8].\\nDealing with all these data and irrigation system capabilities involves great analytical complexity. Automated irrigation controllers have been designed for this purpose. These controllers include a module that computes an optimized irrigation scheduling (and a prescription map in the case of variable rate systems) according to a predefined irrigation strategy and goal. The optimization process is based on sensor data or/and output data from simulation models. Given the complexity of the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum and the uncertainty of the available data, artificial intelligence techniques are used to search for the optimal solution. These techniques are also applied in other related processes, such as model calibration and weather and water demand forecasting [4,8,9].\\nDespite the sophistication of this cutting-edge hardware and software, their prices have become affordable for commercial use. Recent advances in sensors and information and communication technologies have slashed the cost of generating, transmitting, storing and processing large amounts of data. Consequently, the implementation of these technologies in commercial farms is considered feasible, in practice, for improving their economic and environmental footprint. Likewise, its use could improve the adaptation to climate change and to changing water demand and supply patterns, enhancing food security [10,11,12,13].\\nAs a consequence, these technologies for irrigation and agriculture are generally being considered by governments and international organizations as promising tools to achieve a sustainable intensification of agricultural production [14,15,16]. However, some studies carried out in industrialized countries conclude that their adoption is not widespread, and, on average, their economic profitability is low [17,18].\\nFarmers readily adopt technologies, such as auto-steer machinery and irrigation pivots, which require limited new training and skills. However, adoption of information-intensive technologies, such as soil or plant moisture sensors and related software, is often limited. These technologies require further investments in learning and/or hiring external services for data analysis. Changes in management practices are also often needed to accommodate data-driven decisions. Such requirements may even affect the profile of farmers, shifting from that of a land manager, who grows crops according to his/her practical experience, to farm technician, whose work should also be based on technical knowledge [18,19,20].\\nFarmers can adopt very different information technology levels to fine-tune their management practices. Each level encompasses the use of different layers of information. Assessing the value given by each information layer is essential for selecting the most suitable technological level for each farm [5,19,21].\\nThe value of information is the increase in the expected value of the outcome arising from the introduction of an additional layer of information in the decision process [22]. It depends on the quality of the data (e.g., precision, trueness and timing), its total cost (e.g., investment, operation and maintenance) and the conditions of the farm (e.g., environmental, agronomic, socio-economic, and technical). Therefore, a particular technology can provide different economic and environmental results depending on the region and farm where it is used [5,18,21].\\nSelecting and managing the most suitable technological level requires technical knowledge and skills, as well as unbiased information about the performance of the available technologies. Poor information and/or low knowledge and skills mean decisions are made in a context of uncertainty, which in turn, means cultural factors and cognitive biases may lead to the adoption of sub-optimal solutions or simply to no decisions being made. Thus, the early adopters of new technologies are usually younger farmers, with higher education levels and larger farms in terms of economic size [17,18,19,23,24].\\nFarms located in the Mediterranean countries of the EU are usually smallholdings managed by aged farmers with a low level of technical education. These features hamper the uptake of new technologies [24]. An example of this situation is Spain, where 59% of the farmers are older than 55 years and only 18% have agricultural technical training for the implementation of information and communication technologies (ICTs) on their farms. The mean economic farm size is 37,284 € in terms of standard output, which is lower than two thirds of the EU15 average (member states of the EU on 30 April 2004), although the 1% largest farms (≥0.5 M€) accounts for 32% of the national standard output [25].\\nThe Government is tackling this problem by promoting and subsidizing the modernization of irrigation infrastructures. As a result, water transport and distribution facilities, as well as on-farm irrigation systems have been modernized across 1.5 Mha since the beginning of this century [26]. However, a number of studies have suggested that irrigation management should be enhanced in order to capture the full economic and environmental value that modern infrastructure can potentially provide [27,28,29,30,31].\\nMuch research has been specifically conducted to bridge this gap [32,33,34,35,36]. Nevertheless, there are very few analyses focused on identifying the farm conditions that make the techniques developed in these studies profitable. Such analyses, along with a strengthening of extension services, training programs, and regional trials among other measures, would enhance farmers’ capabilities to select and use technologies that help them to optimize the management of their irrigation infrastructures [18,21,24].\\nIt is clear from the above overview that carrying out an optimal irrigation scheduling is essential for improving water and energy use in irrigated agriculture. Accordingly, methodologies focused on this issue and advances in new technologies and equipment to be implemented in this sector have been developed. However, in the majority of farms, these advances have not properly got off the ground due to the low technical training of farmers and the reduced profitability of agricultural products, making the investment of new technologies unaffordable. Hence, the aim of this study is to review the main factors influencing irrigation scheduling and document the impact of ICTs on these factors to identify the conditions that drive the return on investment of various irrigation scheduling methodologies. This review is supported by the analysis of several case studies located in semi-arid areas of Southeast Spain, a country with a 30% of irrigated cropland [37] and most of this area being under Mediterranean natural conditions. The review starts by describing the main factors that should be considered for optimal irrigation scheduling. Then, several case studies methodologies focused on optimal irrigation scheduling applied in both woody and field crops under semi-arid conditions are presented. In the final section, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these irrigation scheduling methodologies, based on the case studies evaluated.\\n2. Factors that Affect Optimal Irrigation Scheduling\\nIrrigation management depends on several factors, most of which are interrelated, as shown in Figure 1. Different combinations of these factors enable optimal irrigation schedules to be achieved depending on the technological level of the farms (low, intermediate, or high) as regards the technological elements used, as described below.\\nWater 12 00785 g001 550Figure 1. Interaction between irrigation scheduling factors.\\n• Crop\\nThe crop is the main driver of irrigation scheduling as irrigation is intended to satisfy the fraction of crop water requirements (WR) that cannot be satisfied with rainwater during the crop season. WR are equivalent to the amount of water evapotranspirated by the crop, ETc, which can be linked to the agro-climatic variable, reference evapotranspiration, ETo, by the crop coefficient, Kc [38]. It depends on the crop characteristics, taking into account crop height, the crop-soil surface resistance, and albedo of the crop soil surface [39].\\nRecommended Kc values for different crops can be found in the literature [38]. However, there are no available Kc values for certain crops, or the recommended values are suited to different environmental conditions [40]. Thus, different works have focused on setting specific Kc values considering on-site environmental conditions by relating the ETc with ETo using lysimeters [41,42,43,44]. Alternatively, other authors have used crop simulation models to determine specific Kc values for non-stressed and well irrigated crops (e.g., bean and cabbage crops in Germany [45]).\\nThe use of specific crop coefficients can improve irrigation programming, generating both higher yields and water use efficiency [46].\\n• Weather data\\nLocal weather determines crop irrigation requirements (IR) and consequently irrigation programming.\\nRainfall and air temperature are the basic data required to calculate IR using values of effective precipitation (Pe) and ETo estimated by low-parameter procedures like the Hargreaves equation [47]. However, many weather stations can now also record data such as humidity, solar radiation and wind speed, among others (e.g., [48]). When this information is available, physically based ETo calculation methods, such as the Penman-Monteith model [38], can be used to provide accurate estimations of ETo [49,50]. Thus, in many cases, there is either a lack of data or their quality is not guaranteed, or the weather station is located too far from the area studied [51,52]. This leads to non-accurate ETo estimations [53] which means uncertainties in the irrigation programming.\\n• Soil data\\nSoil characteristics such as soil condition, slope, texture, structure, depth, organic matter content, bulk density, salinity, acidity drainage, fertility and chemical parameters affect soil water distribution and root water absorption [54]. Standard numerical soil properties at a spatial resolution of 250 m and at a global scale can be obtained from systems such as SoilGridsTM [55]. However, soil measurements are point measurements that show spatiotemporal variability in the same field during the irrigation season. Accordingly, these authors evaluated the time and spatial variability of soil hydraulic characteristics during the cropping season, showing that soil variations during the season are important and lead to inaccurate irrigation programming. Irrigation events also affect soil hydraulic characteristics, which highlights the importance of carrying out soil hydraulic parameter analysis during the cropping season to improve irrigation programming [56].\\nIn sandy soils, with a low water retention capacity, spatiotemporal hydraulic characterization is crucial [57,58]. As an example of watering difficulties in sandy soils, in a two-season study of irrigated potato cultivated in a sandy soil in USA, soil water storage and deep drainage at several zones across the farm were evaluated [57], detecting a significant spatiotemporal variability in soil water storage and temporal differences on deep drainage. To reduce deep drainage, soil water movement models like Hydrus 2-D were used to set the optimum duration of irrigation pulses in strawberries cultivated in extremely sandy soils in Spain, for each crop development stage [58].\\n• Irrigation scheduling criteria\\nIrrigation scheduling consists of setting the timing and the amount of water to be applied to the crop [59] to either maximize the production or to maximize the benefit [59]. Over recent decades, these goals have also been linked to efficiency criteria in the use of both water and energy resources [60]. To achieve them, several “irrigation criteria” have been used to establish the irrigation scheduling: (1) A farmer’s perception/ experience of crop irrigation needs, which usually results in less-than-optimal irrigation scheduling (lack of water during some crop stages and over-irrigation in others) and hence, lower production and profits [61]; (2) Rational estimation of daily crop irrigation requirements using historical climate data that are daily updated during the irrigation season [62]; (3) Rational estimation of daily crop irrigation requirements based on both climate information and on daily soil water balance [63,64]; (4) Estimation of daily irrigation needs using soil water data collected from soil moisture sensors [65,66]; (5) Irrigation needs estimated from plant water status monitoring using sap flow sensors [5,67], trunk growth rate sensors [68], leaf water potential [69], or leaf turgor pressure sensors [70], among others.\\nThe above criteria define the daily irrigation program once the irrigation strategy is established. Several factors condition the irrigation strategy: the water allocation for the whole season (from full irrigation to different levels of deficit irrigation [71]); the type of irrigation system and its hydraulic characteristics [62,63]; or water availability at field scale, according to the management of the irrigation district (on demand irrigation in which farmers can irrigate 24 h a day or by irrigation turns [72,73]), to name a few.\\n• Water source, water rights, and water markets\\nWater sources for irrigation include groundwater from wells, surface water, rain harvesting and treated water from municipal areas [74]. The kind and quality of water source affects water availability at field scale. For example, groundwater is a more reliable water source and less vulnerable to drought compared to surface water [75]. As for using rain harvesting pond or treated water for irrigation, water availability will be affected by climatic variables, the pond storage capacity, and the legislation on that issue [76,77].\\nWater rights are required to legally establish the available water at field scale. “A water right is a legal entitlement authorizing water to be diverted from a specified source and put to beneficial, non-wasteful use” [78]. Hence, water rights affect irrigation programming.\\nTo name a few examples, in England, a license is required to abstract water for irrigation and to obtain/ renew this license, farmers must demonstrate that water is used efficiently [79]. In areas of high competition for water, such as the Mediterranean basin, the water authorities usually impose restrictions on water use that do not always make the producer aware of the efficient use of irrigation water, implementing precision irrigation based on optimal irrigation schedules [80]. In Spain, water allocations are usually assigned per crop, causing occasional disputes between water authorities and farmers, who demand more water [81].\\nIn other areas, water rights are characterized by elements such as priority date, whereby users who first acquired water rights take preference in accessing water resources over other users who obtained their rights later. Hence, during droughts periods, reductions in water allocations affect “new” farmers first [82]. Accordingly, in a study carried out in California’s Central Valley on the effects of water rights on agricultural production during drought periods, it was shown that watersheds whose farmers have more senior water rights have on average better agricultural productivity outcomes than watersheds with more junior rights [83].\\nIn some semi-arid countries, particularly during droughts, economic instruments to deal with water allocations are available. Water markets are one such instrument, enabling voluntary water exchanges between users. Australia, and to a lesser extent, Spain and California, are three representative examples of water trade [84]. In a study on the effects of droughts on water markets in the three regions indicated above, the authors highlighted that drought periods are a triggering factor for water trade between users [84].\\n• Water distribution system and irrigation system.\\nOpen channel water distribution networks usually entail higher water losses than pressurized irrigation networks [85]. Therefore, these losses must be taken into account for irrigation programming [86]. Conversely, pressurized irrigation networks show higher water use efficiency but also increased energy requirements [87]. In these kinds of networks, the operating conditions should be considered in the design of such networks. This ensures that hydrant service conditions are adequate for the proper functioning of on-field irrigation systems, applying the expected water depth and avoiding inadequate irrigation schedules that lead to inefficient use of water [88].\\nThe hydraulic features of the on-farm irrigation system must also be considered to establish the irrigation programming. These features depend on the type of system (surface, sprinkler, or trickle) and its design (layout) and hydrant operation (sectoring) [63,89].\\n• Energy source and its management\\nPressurized water distribution and application systems are generally more efficient in the use of water than open channel systems. For this reason, they have become common in recent decades [90].\\nHowever, the price to be paid for this improvement is the augmentation of energy costs, in many cases leading to increases of more than 50% in the cost of irrigation compared to previous gravity irrigation systems [85].\\nIn recent years, numerous studies have aimed to optimize the use of water and energy in irrigation systems at irrigation district scale considering the operation of the network (sectoring, control of critical points or electric tariff selection, [91,92,93]). The operation of the main hydraulic networks designed to reduce energy costs may limit the available irrigation time for farmers conditioning the irrigation schedule of their fields. For example, some irrigation districts (ID) in Spain have reduced their energy costs by choosing the lowest electric tariff: farmers can irrigate during the night from Monday to Friday and for 24 h on Saturdays, Sundays, and bank holidays [73]. Their energy costs savings are about 25% for similar water use [94].\\nHowever, optimal management of irrigation networks does not avoid the dependence of irrigation agriculture on fluctuations in energy prices. Therefore, in recent years, the reduction of electricity production costs from renewable energy sources (wind, solar photovoltaic and micro hydropower) is facilitating their incorporation into the irrigation sector [64,95,96]. Since the generation of energy depends on suitable weather conditions (sufficient wind or solar radiation for pumping), irrigation must be scheduled around the availability of renewably sourced energy [64].\\n• Management and control technologies\\nThe technological development of the last decade has had enormous repercussions in irrigation management and control. Today’s commercial sensors and irrigation controllers, ICs, provide a good value for money in an affordable price range for most farmers. In addition, the constant improvement of information and communication technologies, ICTs, facilitates the interaction between sensors, IC, and users through web platforms and applications for mobile devices [62,97].\\nICs open and close pipes remotely enabling or disabling the electro-valves associated with each irrigation sector according to the irrigation times programmed (input data). These are key devices to make irrigation easier for farmers as they can start and finish irrigation at any time, no matter day or night, during the daily period available for irrigation with daily, weekly or monthly frequency. Input data are introduced by the user, or a baseline irrigation schedule is updated periodically according to real time information on the variables that affect irrigation (e.g., soil moisture, pressure at the pumping station, irradiance) measured by sensors [64]. The IC’s operational rules may be simple (exceedance of threshold values) or optimal irrigation schedules based on soil-plant-water models and optimization procedures [34,98,99,100,101]. Thus, the IC installed on a farm conditions the irrigation programming.\\nThere currently exists a wide range of commercial sensors to monitor and control crop, soil, climatic variables and the irrigation network. Their records are stored in data loggers that, in most cases, can be remotely accessed by ICs and/or web platforms/app for mobile terminals.\\nWeb platforms funded by either public institutions or private associations to support irrigation programming have become a common tool among technical staff and farmers, many of them accessible by apps for smartphones/tablets, thanks to the exponential development of ICTs in recent years [102]. Irrigation apps allow farmers to visualize the key variables of each event, and even act on the system from almost anywhere, as telecommunication coverage has improved in rural areas. Web platforms and apps are accessible for both individual farmers and irrigators’ associations, expanding the number of potential users compared to the supervisory control and acquisition data systems, SCADA, which monitored and controlled systems from a fixed location and were restricted to associations and large farms, but which have been a key factor in the digitization of irrigated agriculture [103].\\nThe spatiotemporal variability of applied water depth should be considered to improve irrigation scheduling. Remote sensing techniques based on the use of satellite images and unmanned aerial vehicles, or geostatistical methods that require either detailed soil study and dense sampling or estimation of soil moisture content from alternative low-cost techniques (e.g., electromagnetic induction exploration techniques) are complementary tools for monitoring the real application of irrigation water. This permits the visualization of the spatial variability of soil water content, splitting the cropped area into irrigation sectors with ad hoc irrigation programs [30,104,105].\\n• Data analysis and artificial intelligence (AI)\\nThe modernization of many irrigation networks involved not only the change of hydraulic infrastructures, but also the installation of telemetry devices, initially aimed at automating billing, recording consumption at user level at certain intervals (big data collection) [103].\\nThe robustness of the current telemetry systems, most of which are based on wireless communication, facilitates database feeding with large amounts of data. It is increasingly common today for farmers’ associations to record detailed information on their users’ water consumption (hourly consumption) throughout the irrigation campaign. These massive data sets (weather, crop, soil, irrigation network operation and even markets data) require storage space (e.g., cloud storage) to be further processed by AI techniques. There are a wide variety of AI techniques, such as artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, or decision trees, that can be applied separately or combined to improve the accuracy of irrigation programming [98,102].\\nConsumption data linked to water use features at hydrant level (soil, critical periods of crop development, water allocation, etc.), agroclimatic information provided by public and/or private web platforms and, when available, the knowledge of farmer’s behaviour (related, for example, to their perception of weather conditions, national holidays and vacation periods) allow accurate predictions of irrigation scheduling at farmer scale (when, how much and for how long he/she irrigates) [106,107,108]. Accurate individual irrigation schedules aggregated at irrigation district level provide valuable information for managers to optimize the use of water and energy.\\n• Economy and farmer’s behaviour\\nThe costs of current irrigation scheduling systems (e.g., ICs, sensors, apps, web platforms, etc.) are generally falling. However, for moderate- to low-profit crops, this technology may still be cost-prohibitive if it doesn’t significantly increase farmer income [61]. However, the production of high value crops in areas with low water availability, such as greenhouse crops in Southeast Spain, is highly technological, particularly in irrigation scheduling [109].\\nMarket demands have a great influence on farmers, as the economic factor is the main driver for improving their irrigation management (including technology). Markets, especially for fresh products, demand products be obtained sustainably. Water plays a crucial role in the concept of sustainability applied to irrigated agricultural production. For growers, it is increasingly important that their products are identified as sustainable through the corresponding indicators and certifications, in order to maintain or even increase their market price. For example, the use of the Water Footprint indicator (volume of water used throughout the growing season divided by the production obtained) [110], which can be estimated by applying different methodologies (waterfootprint.org, ISO14046 standard [80,111]), encourages the use of optimal irrigation scheduling systems to make efficient use of water while maintaining production levels.\\n3. Actual Cases of Application of Optimal Irrigation Programming\\n3.1. Automatic Irrigation Scheduling in Woody Crops\\nThis study case focuses on the results obtained in the implementation of an automated irrigation protocol based on water uptake estimated from soil water content data, measured by multi-capacitance probes, on two early-maturing Prunus persica L. orchards growing in semi-arid conditions in Southeast Spain. This area is subject to Mediterranean climate where water resources are dwindling, and agriculture sector accounts for 80% of all water withdrawals. Under this scenario, most water user associations must deal with permanent water deficits through the irrigation season. The water application for high crop yield and quality must be carried out in such a way as to be efficient in relieving stress in the most sensitive phenological phases by applying deficit irrigation (DI) strategies [112]. DI requires the use of sensors for real time monitoring of the soil-plant-atmosphere system [113].\\nA controlled deficit irrigated peach tree experiment and a full-irrigated nectarine tree experiments are described in the following subsections. Both studies aim to compare irrigation scheduling based on soil water sensors with an ETc-based treatment.\\n3.1.1. Experimental Site and Plant Material\\nThe experiments were carried out at the CEBAS-CSIC experimental field station in Santomera, Murcia, Spain (38°06′31″ N, 1°02′14″ W, 110 m altitude) in two adjacent early-maturing Prunus persica (L.) Batsch tree orchards: peach trees (cv. Flordastar) were spaced 5 × 5 m, and nectarine trees (cv. Flariba) 6.5 m × 3.5 m, both trained to an open-centre canopy. The soil in the 0–0.5 m layer was stony, highly calcareous (45% calcium carbonate), with a clay loam texture (clay fraction: 41% Illite, 17% Smectite, and 30% Paligorskita). The average bulk density was 1.43 g cm−3. The soil water content at field capacity and wilting permanent point were 0.29 and 0.14 m3 m−3, respectively.\\nThe average electrical conductivity (EC25ºC) of the irrigation water was close to 1.3 dS m−1. The irrigation system (97% uniformity coefficient) consisted of a single drip line per tree row with pressure-compensated emitters (8 × 2 Lh−1 and 4 × 4 Lh−1 per tree for peach and nectarine trees, respectively) ', 'unique_identifier': 30}\n",

Introduction\\nDue to rising global population levels and the subsequent need for more food production, agriculture now consumes more than 70 percent of \\nthe world\\'s freshwater resources [1]. Poor water-use efficiency and low production are just two of the problems plaguing the traditional approach \\nto irrigation management [2]. As a result, the quantity of precipitation that can be used to irrigate crops is dynamically influenced by global \\nwarming and climate change [3]. Sustainable targeted irrigation is a critical step toward achieving food security by mitigating the \\nunpredictability of rainfall and the impact of water shortages caused by drought. To make up for water lost via evaporation, runoff, and deep \\npercolation, accurate irrigation scheduling ensures that water is applied to plants precisely when and where it is required in the correct \\nproportions[4]. Management of Irrigation Systems Saving water and the associated indirect energy consumption costs through careful \\nmonitoring and fine-tuned management will maximize efficiency and save money [5, 6]. Smart agricultural applications have achieved \\ncontrolled monitoring of agricultural processes through the integration of wireless sensor network (WSN) technologies and the Internet of\\nThings (IoT). This has resulted in a more significant comprehension of the dynamic changes in weather, soil, and crop conditions during the \\ngrowing season, thanks to the rapid successes of remote sensing. Satellites, sensors on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) [7], and mobile \\nirrigation platforms such as lateral and center pivot moving machines are among the various examples of IoT-enabled sensors or equipment \\nthat may be used to continually pool real-time data from the desired area [8]. Therefore, intelligent decisions can be achieved by employing \\nmachine learning (ML) models by leveraging the massive amounts of geospatial data that varies over time and can be gathered and stored in \\nmultiple cloud servers [9]. ML provides a robust and adaptable framework for data-driven decision-making and in-depth system knowledge. \\nTogether, big data technologies and the ability of edge cloud computing to learn without being explicitly programmed have opened up a new \\nway to make sense of and draw conclusions from the huge amounts of data that sensors collect [10]. These technologies will facilitate the \\nconversion of raw data into useful information for making choices about irrigation and taking appropriate actions in the field or greenhouse. As \\na result, it saves money, reduces fatigue, and better uses energy and irrigation water [11, 12]. Furthermore, thanks to the development of climate_x0002_and environment-based paradigms for calculating crop water needs, farmers should be able to easily monitor and visualize the different metrics \\non smartphones or other computing systems to direct their choices, intelligently or manually. In addition, survey research has indicated that \\n90% of farmers favor using mobile and online apps to better control their irrigation systems to boost agricultural output [13, 14]. This study \\naims to summarize how AI and wireless sensor networks have been put to use in the irrigation industry. The structure of this paper is as follows: \\nThe current section provides an introduction. The second section explores the classification of AI techniques in irrigation systems.

Classification of Artificial Intelligent in Irrigation Systems \\nJohn McCarthy initially used the phrase \"artificial intelligence\" in 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference, defining it as the technology and \\nengineering of creating intelligent machines or intelligent computer programs [15]. Machines can learn, comprehend, and respond appropriately \\nthanks to artificial intelligence technology, which gives them computational intelligence. ML, Fuzzy logic (FL), natural language processing \\n(NLP), swarm intelligence (SI), expert systems (ES), deep learning (DL), and computer vision (CV) are all types of artificial intelligence. \\nResearch into AI algorithms is widespread across many industries, including the agricultural sector [16, 17]. These days, artificial intelligence \\nand the IoT are among the most popular innovative technologies used in agriculture. The sensors in the IoT-based smart farming system are \\nmeant to keep tabs on soil moisture and soil nutrients. The use of AI systems to compute the optimum soil watering needs is also being \\ninvestigated [18]. Farmers may also discover answers to their questions and learn to use cutting-edge technology to boost crop yields. Because \\nof this, AI and the IoT will be the two most important technologies in the agricultural sector [15, 19]. Here, we take a look back at the AI \\nalgorithms that powered the studies presented in this research (see Fig. 1).\\nFig. 1. Artificial intelligence techniques\\n2.1. Fuzzy logic algorithm\\nIrrigation is a complicated system with inherent nonlinearities, making it challenging to formulate the mathematical equation that explains the \\nsystem. A fuzzy controller model could use rules in an \"if-then-else\" structure instead of a mathematical formula. This model would be based \\non experts\\' process knowledge [20]. By precisely estimating the quantity of irrigation and controlling the nonlinearity connected with the \\nprocess, the fuzzy logic irrigation control algorithm serves as a valuable control mechanism for assuring irrigation accuracy and enhancing \\nwater usage efficiency [21]. The designer\\'s familiarity with process (plant) dynamics is crucial to developing effective fuzzy rules and \\ndemonstrating their practicability via experimentally gathered long-term data, contributing significantly to the controller\\'s efficacy and \\nreliability [22].\\nAsaad Y. G. et. al, Journal of Techniques, Vol. 5, No. 3, 2023\\n28\\n2.2. Artificial neural network algorithm\\nArtificial neural networks (ANNs) are learning algorithms that build on how natural neural systems, such as the human brain, analyze data. The \\nbillions of neurons in the human brain constantly communicate with one another to process information [10]. ANN\\'s nonlinearity features, \\ninput-to-output mapping capability, and ability to forecast several dependent variables make its artificial neurons functionally equivalent to the \\nhuman brain\\'s biological neurons [23]. Because of their propensity to learn and adapt to the changing factors impacting irrigation, ANN-based \\ncontrollers have been employed in irrigation control systems [24]. ANN has also been used as an effective tactic for dealing with the challenge \\nof developing mathematical models from fundamental principles. Nevertheless, the completeness with which the data input describes the \\nsystem\\'s behavior is crucial to the accuracy of the ANN-based prediction model or controller. Suitable and quality sensors should be used to \\ncapture data on required parameters, and a suitable sample time should be selected [22].\\n2.3. Machine learning algorithm\\nML is a subfield of AI that enables machines to acquire new skills without being taught directly [25, 26]. ML aims to make computers carry \\nout tasks on par with human intelligence by acquiring knowledge through experience [27]. Efficient intelligence-based decision support systems \\nfor the sustainable and equitable use of water sources in precision irrigation management have been demonstrated through the successful \\napplication of ML and deep learning models. Historically, farmers have relied on their knowledge and experience to decide whether or not to \\nirrigate; however, recent advances in ML have made it possible to include forecasts of weather and soil conditions in irrigation choices. Knowing \\nthe water requirements, yield, and soil moisture content in advance allows for proactive response and improved management in irrigation \\nplanning, making prediction a crucial aspect of the process [28]. It is possible to achieve precision in irrigation activities by using ML techniques \\nto automatically extract fresh information in the form of generalized decision rules. ML approaches, including federated learning, reinforcement \\nlearning, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning, have been more prominent in the area of precision irrigation management to address \\ndifficult problems like categorization and prediction [29]. In specific scenarios, the model can take care of the feature extraction work, a \\nsignificant benefit of DL. DL models have helped many fields and businesses, and agriculture is no exception. DL models are often used in \\nagriculture to process images and sounds. Most DL algorithms are ANNs with several hidden layers between the input and output layers. The \\nuse of supervised and unsupervised learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and \\nlong short-term memories (LSTMs), can help with irrigation decision management [30, 31]. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a \\ncomputational optimization technique inspired by bird flocking and fish schooling behavior. In an irrigation system, PSO can be used to optimize \\nthe water allocation process by minimizing water waste while maximizing crop yield.\\nPSO works by creating a particle swarm that represents potential solutions to the optimization problem. The position and velocity of every \\nparticle are modified by considering the particle\\'s individual best solution and the swarm\\'s overall best solution. These updates lead the particles \\nto converge toward the optimal solution. In an irrigation system, PSO can optimize the allocation of water resources by determining the ideal \\nquantity of water to be applied to each crop, depending on weather, soil moisture, and crop growth stage. Utilizing this technology can result \\nin optimized water resource management and increased crop productivity [32].\\n2.4. Expert system algorithm\\nES are computer-based tools that use knowledge and rules to solve complex problems in a specific domain. In an irrigation system [33], an ES \\ncan provide recommendations on irrigation management based on rules and knowledge about the crop, soil, climate, and irrigation system [34]. \\nThe ES algorithm in an irrigation system typically involves the following steps [35].\\n▪ Knowledge acquisition: Gather information from experts, scientific research, and other sources to develop a knowledge base of rules and \\ninformation about the crop, soil, climate, and irrigation system.\\n▪ Rule-based reasoning: Use rules and logical reasoning to analyze the data collected from sensors and other monitoring tools and make \\nrecommendations on irrigation management.\\n▪ Inference engine: Use an inference engine to apply the rules to the data and generate recommendations based on the current state of the \\ncrop and irrigation system.\\n▪ User interface: Provide a user-friendly interface for farmers and irrigation managers to interact with the system, input data, and receive \\nrecommendations.\\n▪ Feedback: Monitor the results of the irrigation management decisions and use this information to refine the rules and knowledge base over \\ntime.\\nThe ES algorithm can help to improve irrigation management by providing accurate and timely recommendations to farmers and irrigation \\nmanagers [36]. By optimizing irrigation management, the ES can help to reduce water waste, improve crop yield, and promote sustainable \\nagriculture practices. However, it should be noted that the effectiveness of the ES may be influenced by factors such as data quality, rule \\naccuracy, and system maintenance and may need to be calibrated to local conditions [37].\\n2.5. Threshold value algorithm\\nIt is a simple, easy-to-understand algorithm that can monitor several irrigation-related factors and control the irrigation process. An SPDT \\n(single pole, double throw) switch is used to switch between modes. In one setup, the tool is set only to track watering-related data. \"Half-active \\nmode\" describes this state. In other settings, the utility monitors everything and regulates watering depending on relative humidity. \"Full Active \\nMode\" describes this state. When activated for the first time, the system checks the weather. The rain causes the machine to sleep for about half \\nan hour; otherwise, it will connect to the nearest open WiFi network [38]. The general flowchart of the threshold value algorithm is shown in \\nFig. 2.\\n2.6. IrrSchedult algorithm\\nThe irrigation scheduling algorithm IrrSchedult employs the crop water stress index (CWSI) to establish the ideal timing and quantity of water \\nrequired for a crop. The algorithm works by monitoring the crop\\'s water stress level using infrared thermometry and using this information to \\nschedule irrigation events. The IrrSchedult algorithm consists of four main steps. First: determine the crop\\'s baseline temperature using infrared \\nthermometry. Second: Measure the crop\\'s canopy temperature regularly and calculate the CWSI using the following formula: CWSI = (Tc –\\nAsaad Y. G. et. al, Journal of Techniques, Vol. 5, No. 3, 2023\\n29\\nTmin) / (Tmax – Tmin), where Tc is the canopy temperature, Tmin is the minimum temperature, and Tmax is the maximum temperature. Third: use \\nthe CWSI to determine the crop\\'s water stress level. If the CWSI exceeds a predetermined threshold, the crop is considered under water stress, \\nand irrigation is scheduled. Fourth: Calculate the amount of water to be applied based on the crop\\'s water use rate and the time until the next \\nirrigation event. Using the CWSI to schedule irrigation events, the IrrSchedult algorithm can help optimize water use, reduce water waste, and \\nimprove crop yield. However, it should be noted that the algorithm\\'s effectiveness may be influenced by factors such as soil type, weather \\nconditions, and irrigation system efficiency and may need to be calibrated to local conditions. Fig. 3 shows a diagram describing the irrigation \\nscheduling algorithm \"IrrSchedule\" [39].\\n2.7. Decision Support System algorithm\\nThe Decision Support System (DSS) algorithm can help improve irrigation management\\'s efficiency and effectiveness by providing real-time \\ninformation and recommendations to farmers and irrigation managers. By optimizing irrigation management, the DSS can help to reduce water \\nwaste, improve crop yield, and promote sustainable agriculture practices. The DSS algorithm employs basic constructs such as \"IF,\" \"ELSE,\" \\nand \"IF-ELSE\" to achieve its objective. Data from sensors is used to make decisions; it simplifies the code with increased softness, efficiency, \\nand performance [40].

Previous Works\\nWith an emphasis on research from the last four years, this portion of the review examines the most recent advancements in intelligent irrigation \\nsystems. The recent works can be organized according to the adopted algorithm for irrigation systems as follows: \\n3.1. Previous works-based ANN\\nUsing neural networks in irrigation systems allows for improved efficiency and precision in water management, leading to enhanced crop yields \\nand resource conservation, as evidenced by various recent studies and developments built upon the ANN framework. Maroufpoor et al. [41]\\nused a model to obtain the coefficient of uniformity (CU) values for the four sprinkler types: ZM22, ZK30, LUXOR, and AMBO. It is a reliable \\nindicator for measuring water loss. The proposed design comprises a high-pressure electric pump, a water tank, a main pipe, regulator valves, \\na bypass pipe, gauges, a volumetric flow meter, a spray stand, sprinklers, and sample collection containers. ANN uses a coarseness index (nozzle \\nsizes), average wind speed, and lateral spacing of the sprinkler to determine CU values. Experimental findings demonstrated that the suggested \\nstrategy lowers water loss. However, the magnitudes of the statistical indicators of the models used fluctuated significantly between the testing \\nphases. Nawandar and Satpute. \\nAccording to the authors [42], a low-cost smart irrigation system was created that utilizes the Internet of Things to enable seamless \\ncommunication and independent functioning of the devices employed in the system. The system consists of three units: An irrigation unit: \\nwhich includes a water source, a water pump, and a pipeline. The control unit: It includes a soil moisture sensor, a moisture and temperature \\nsensor, and a universal sensor pole (USP) that controls the sensors, sends data to the server, alerts the irrigation unit, and gets feedback from it. \\nMoreover, it makes the decision based on the ANN. Remote monitoring module: It includes a message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) \\nbroker that gets the sensor data sent by USP and an HTTP server for remote monitoring. The results showed that the proposed system saves \\nwater by 67% compared to traditional methods. However, the proposed system must manually enter the plant information and the soil type to \\ncreate an irrigation schedule.\\nKamyshova et al. [43] Suggested a way to improve agricultural irrigation effectiveness by integrating artificial neural networks and computer \\nvision strategies. Eight IP cameras are connected via cable to a digital video recorder (DVR), connected to a laptop with an active internet \\nconnection on a center pivot irrigation. Build a database of ideal agricultural irrigation parameters and use neural network techniques to build \\ndynamic maps of irrigation prescriptions to boost irrigation efficiency (ranging from layered artificial neural networks to pattern recognition \\nand convolutional neural networks). Statistical evidence suggests improved efficiency in the use of water for irrigation. However, their \\nimplementation and maintenance costs are so exorbitant that their use is limited. \\nVeerachamy and Ramar [44] developed the Agricultural Irrigation Recommendation and Alert System (AIRA) to aid agriculture workers. The\\ntechnology is designed to help agricultural engineers make the best irrigation choice possible by performing three primary functions. Several \\nsensors, including a soil moisture sensor, an air humidity and temperature sensor, and a wind speed and intensity sensor, are used by the system \\nto gather information from the field. Then, the gathered data undergoes processing in a hybrid classifier called k-N4\\n, which combines the k_x0002_nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithm with ANN. The suggested k-N4\\nalgorithm is used to categorize the incoming data, alarm messages are \\ncreated when water level and pressure are low, and a modified PSO algorithm based on gravity and fuzzy clustering is employed to arrive at \\nthe optimal irrigation option. In contrast, the M-RSA technique encrypts sensitive information while measuring low water levels. The findings \\nindicated that the suggested method contributes to efficient water management, better data security, and future financial gains. However, the \\nproposed system adopted soil, water, and climate data without any plantations in the field. \\n3.2. Previous works-based fuzzy control\\nIntegrating fuzzy control in irrigation systems enables intelligent and adaptive decision-making processes, resulting in optimized water \\nallocation and improved agricultural productivity, as evidenced by several recent studies and advancements built upon fuzzy control techniques.\\nLi et al. [45] developed a fuzzy inference system-based real-time irrigation decision support system (IDSS) with relevant software. The purpose \\nof the IDSS was to evaluate its effectiveness in supplying guidance for real-time irrigation planning and forecasting the timing of alfalfa \\nharvesting. There are three primary components to the IDSS structure: first, the model for alfalfa growth is responsible for determining alfalfa \\nheight and growth dependent on temperature, which has been used to forecast when to harvest alfalfa. Secondly, the soil water model, \\nresponsible for soil water (SW) and alfalfa water consumption estimates made using weather prediction information. Thirdly, the fogging \\ninference system determines the amount of irrigation using soil moisture and the difference in clover height between the expected and observed \\nvalues. After gathering the data, IDSS uses a Fuzzy inference algorithm to create the irrigation time and volume needed to real-time schedule \\nwater. According to the results, the IDSS determined the optimal time and amount of irrigation needed for the irrigation system to operate \\nefficiently. However, water savings, crop productivity, and spatial variability are not focused on in the development of IDSS.\\nMounir et al. [46] suggested a smart watering system (SWS) for small and medium-sized gardens and fields. The Android app supports it. It \\nincludes a soil moisture sensor, a light intensity sensor, and an air temperature and humidity sensor. The proposed SWS uses blockchain and \\nfuzzy logic to evaluate data and define an irrigation plan. After a decision is made by a fuzzy logic system based on the values of the input \\nvariables, SWS engages the actuators to carry out irrigation activities, turning ON/OFF the water tunnels periodically. The results of the \\nproposed system show that it is a reliable and safe tool for plant irrigation management. However, the mechanism created for watering the \\nplants needs manual intervention by the farmer.\\nJaiswal and Ballal [47] introduced an automated irrigation controller based on real-time fuzzy inference. It consists of three units: the sensor \\nnetwork, which consists of the water level sensor, the soil moisture sensor, the air temperature sensor, the humidity sensor, and the control unit, \\nbased on the fuzzy inference system. GPRS-based communication module and Weblogger built on the Laboratory Virtual Instrumentation \\nEngineering Workbench (LabVIEW) platform. The fuzzy logic control determines the percentage of valve opening based on the preset values \\nof soil moisture, humidity, the water level in the tank, and air temperature. The availability-based tariff (ABT)-based tariff system also enables \\nscheduling irrigation at a low-tariff time. The results showed that the proposed method achieves 45% water savings compared to previous \\nstudies. However, the proposed system is expensive in terms of first-time installation.\\nAsaad Y. G. et. al, Journal of Techniques, Vol. 5, No. 3, 2023\\n33\\nKrishnan et al. [48] presented an intelligent irrigation system that enables farmers to water their crops With the support of the Global System \\nfor Mobile Communication (GSM). The system provides signals of acknowledgement regarding its functions, such as soil moisture content, \\nambient temperature, and motor status regarding mains or solar energy. The fuzzy logic controller generates the motor state outputs, calculating \\ninput factors, including soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. Additionally, the device shuts down the engine to conserve energy when rain\\nis forecast. Hand immersion and Drip irrigation were contrasted with the suggested system. The comparison findings show that the suggested \\nintelligent irrigation system conserves water and energy. \\nJamroen et al. [49] Presented an intelligent fuzzy-based method for irrigation scheduling using a cheap WSN. The proposed irrigation scheduling \\nmethod considered soil moisture and the crop water stress index. In addition to the wireless transmission of sensor data, the system is based on \\ntwo sensor complexes, the first of which includes an Arduino Uno, soil moisture sensors, infrared temperature sensors, humidity sensors, \\ntemperature sensors, and light sensors. The second component is the control unit, which includes the Arduino DUE, pump drive unit, pump, \\nand thermometer. The experimental results showed the effectiveness of the proposed irrigation scheduling system concerning its accuracy and \\nefficiency in terms of water use and energy consumption. Agricultural production increased by 22.58%, water use decreased by 59.61%, and \\nelectricity use decreased by 67.35%. Although CWSI shows promise, several factors limit its practical use.\\nBenyezza et al. [50] Developed a low-cost smart network irrigation system based on zoning using the IoT to reduce water usage and energy \\nconsumption. The network comprises four regions, each equipped with a sensor node that includes an Arduino nano microcontroller, batteries, \\na soil moisture sensor, a humidity sensor, a temperature sensor, a valve, and a data transceiver unit. Through radio frequency (RF) \\ncommunications, the data collected by the network is transmitted to a Raspberry Pi server. An irrigation decision is made by a fuzzy logic \\ncontroller (FLC), which processes this data. A Human Man Interface (HMI) has been created under the Node-RED server to facilitate the \\nmonitoring and controlling of irrigation from any location and at any time through the developed system. The results indicate that the proposed \\nsystem achieved water savings of 26.41% and energy consumption reductions of 65.22%. However, it should be noted that providing an exact \\npercentage of improvement is problematic because it needs to be evaluated in various aspects.\\nIn a study by Parrazales et al. [51], a design for an FLC was proposed to enhance the watering process for rose plants. The system incorporates \\ntwo sensors that measure air humidity and temperature, with the latter and relative humidity serving as the primary control variables. The FLC \\nand membership functions were developed using the Mamdani method and a programmable gate array (FPGA) in a domestic greenhouse that \\nhoused a cluster of rose plants. The results showed that water consumption was reduced to 0.2 liters per week or up to 10.4 liters per year \\ncompared to traditional manual irrigation. However, the proposed design is a case that cannot be generalized because only one plant species \\nand specific variants were used.\\nSingh et al. [52] developed an innovative fuzzy logic irrigation control system to automatically control water pumps used in agricultural \\ngreenhouses and farms. It has an Arduino, a soil moisture sensor, an air humidity and temperature sensor, a DC pump, and solar panels, and it \\nis serially connected to a laptop. These sensors, along with the solar radiation taken from the characteristics of the solar panel, provide \\ninformation that the Simulink model uses to control the speed of the water pump, turning it on and off. The results showed that the system \\nreduced water usage, reduced costs, and reduced energy consumption. However, the irrigation process is not automated for a variety of plants \\nor soils.\\n3.3. Previous works-based ANFIS \\nThe utilization of Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) in irrigation systems offers a hybrid approach that combines the \\nadvantages of neural networks and fuzzy logic, leading to enhanced water management, increased crop yields, and sustainable agricultural \\npractices, as evidenced by numerous recent studies and advancements in ANFIS-based research. A fuzzy inference system was developed by \\nMendes et al. [53] that considers the field\\'s geographical variability and uses sparse or ill-defined information on the crop\\'s phenophase from \\nsatellite photos to determine whether to speed up or slow down the central pivot to the critical choice-making for precise watering. The program \\nadheres to the guidelines for variable rate irrigation (VR). The volume of provided water varies as soon as the speed does by management zones. \\nExperiments showed the pivot operation\\'s potential efficacy. The rotation speed control, however, does not consider the volume of the water \\nlayer that will be applied. Water demand will flu', 'unique_identifier': 36}\n",

SIS has endorsed various machine learning models. However, there has been no attempt to analyze the empirical evidence on ML models in a systematic way. Moreover, ML based SIS often face problems and raise questions that must be resolved. This article presents a systematic literature review of ML based SIS; an overview of the literature on ML is designed, revealing a premier and unbiased survey of the existing empirical research. 55 selected studies published from 2017 to 2023 and nine broadly used ML models were identified. Furthermore, four analysis aspects namely type of ML technique, estimation accuracy, model comparison, and estimation context have been outlined. The findings of this review prove the performance capability of the ML techniques endorsed within SIS. The ML techniques outperform other conventional approaches. However, the application of ML models in SIS is still limited and more effort is needed to obtain well-formed and generalizable results. To this end, and based on the outcomes obtained in this work, future guidelines have been provided to practitioners and researchers to grasp the major contributions and challenges in the state-of-the-art research.\\n\\nPrevious article in issueNext article in issue\\nKeywords\\nSmart irrigation systemMachine learningSystematic literature review\\n1. Introduction\\nThe world knows emergency problems, foremost among them being the scarcity of fresh water. Around 70 % of freshwater used in agricultural activities such irrigation and the supply nutrient for plant growth. The demand for freshwater is escalating with the increasing food demand of a fast-growing population [1]. The optimal solution for this problem is switching from traditional irrigation methods to new irrigation systems by including new technologies such internet of thing (IoT), machine learning (ML), wireless sensor network (WSN) giving birth to the term smart irrigation systems (SIS). This latter allows us to improve the irrigation decision-making and monitoring water systems to enhance crop productivity [2].\\n\\nSIS aims to prevent both under-irrigation and over-irrigation, ensuring optimal crop yields. Many types of crops have specific water requirements that vary throughout their growth stages. Also, SIS Overcomes hurdles soil erosion and crop specific irrigation problem. Efficient Irrigation guaranties a sustainable use of water, this indicates that SIS is not trivial task, instead, it composes of several complicated steps [3]. Globally, the main purpose behind smart irrigation systems is that enhance agricultural productivity at the same time reducing the environmental impact of crops.\\n\\nOne of the most used technics in SIS is Machine Learning. It addresses the question of how to build a computer system that improves automatically through experience [4,5]. ML techniques re known for (i) their capacity to independently tackle significant nonlinear challenges by utilizing datasets from various origins, and (ii) their flexibility in integrating fresh data to enhance the accuracy (Mohammed [6,7]). They are being used in the context of studying smart irrigation to provide users with better recommendations and help constructing powerful ML models.\\n\\nML techniques are integrated in many fields, they are used in irrigation field to estimate soil moisture content, to estimate the reference of evapotranspiration, to improve energy management performance and to Predict water table depth. Generally speaking with ML we can provide decision-making in irrigated agriculture by using meteorological and soil data, also we can contribute to sustainability efforts by conserving water resources. By precisely delivering water where and when it is needed, these systems reduce unnecessary irrigation, mitigate water scarcity issues, and promote efficient water management practices in agriculture. However, the ML discipline does not have a definite classification scheme for its algorithms, mostly due to the number of paradigms and the uncertainties introduced in the literature ([8,7]b; [9]). Subsequently, it becomes difficult and confusing to choose an ML algorithm that fits one's need when developing a smart irrigation computational model.\\n\\nIn order to gain a comprehensive understanding of the existing research on the utilization of machine learning (ML) in smart irrigation system, we conducted a systematic literature review (SLR). A SLR serves to identify potential research gaps in a specific problem area and offers guidance to both practitioners and researchers interested in pursuing further investigations in that field. The SLR methodology entails accessing relevant studies from electronic databases, synthesizing the findings, and presenting them in response to the defined research questions. By conducting an SLR, new perspectives emerge, aiding newcomers in comprehending the current state-of-the-art in the field.\\n\\nIt is crucial for an SLR to be replicable, meaning that all the steps taken must be clearly explained, and the results should be transparent for other researchers to evaluate. Objectivity and transparency are key factors for the success of an SLR [10]. As the name suggests, an SLR necessitates a systematic approach that encompasses all the literature published thus far. This study provides an exhaustive compilation of the existing literature regarding the use of machine learning for smart irrigation system. Additionally, we present our empirical findings and address the research questions defined within this review article. For this systematic literature review we collected all studies that integrated the important technologies used in the process of SIS. Publications between 2017 and 2023 were considered, in which the important technology is machine learning with its different approaches.\\n\\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology used in this review. Section 3 presents and discusses the review results. Section 4 provides the limitation of this work and Section 5 provides conclusions and future guidelines obtained from this systematic review.\\n\\n2. Method\\nThe systematic review planning used in this work has been inspired from the SLR process suggested by Kitchenham and Charters [10], the process is detailed in Fig. 1, the important steps of this process:\\n\\nFig. 1\\nDownload : Download high-res image (250KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 1. Systematic review process.\\n\\nResearch questions identification: we construct the research questions based on the purpose of SLR.\\n\\nSearch strategy design: we described the search strategy to find out the important studies to the research question, this step involves both identification of search terms and selection of sources to be searched in order to identify the initial list.\\n\\nStudy selection criteria: we extract the relevant studies from the initial list by using the inclusion and exclusion criteria that we will identify in the next section, for each primary study in initial list.\\n\\nData extraction: we involve the design of data extraction forms to collect the required information in order to answer the research questions\\n\\nData synthesis: we determined the proper methodologies for synthesizing the extracted data based on the types of the data and the research questions the data addressed.\\n\\nA review protocol is of critical importance for an SLR (M [11]). To ensure the rigorousness and repeatability of this SLR and to reduce researcher bias as well, we elaborately developed the review protocol by frequently holding group discussion meetings on protocol design. In the next Subsection, we will present the details of the review protocol. At the end of this section, we will analyze the threats to validity of the review protocol.\\n\\n3. Research questions\\nThe goal of this SLR is to summarize and clarify the empirical evidence obtained from the studies using the ML techniques for SIS in the literature. Toward this goal five research questions (RQs) were defined as presented in Table 1. From the selected studies we identified the ML techniques used in Smart irrigation system (RQ1), and then we analyzed the performance of the ML techniques for SIS (RQ2). This question focuses on the values of the performance measures for SIS, after that we compare the performance of ML techniques with non-ML techniques (RQ3), The aim of this question is to determine whether ML techniques are better than the statistical techniques. (RQ4) we do a comparison between different ML techniques, whose can be synthesized to determine which ML models consistently outperform other ML models. The final question (RQ5) determines the strengths and weakness of different ML techniques.\\n\\nTable 1.

Search strategy\\nThe detailed description of the search strategies utilized in this research consisted of search terms, literature resources and search process as explained below:\\n\\n4.1. Search terms\\nThe following steps were used to generate the search terms [12]:\\na)\\nDerivation of major terms from the research questions.\\n\\nb)\\nIdentification of alternative spellings and synonyms for major terms.\\n\\nc)\\nIdentification of keywords in relevant papers or books.\\n\\nd)\\nUsage of the Boolean OR to incorporate alternative spellings and synonyms.\\n\\ne)\\nUsage of the Boolean AND to link the major terms.\\n\\n\\nThe resulting search terms are described as follows: (“Smart Irrigation” OR “Precision Irrigation”) AND (“Machine Learning” OR “Artificial Intelligence”)\\n\\n4.2. Literature resources\\nThe literature resources we exploited to search for primary studies contain six electronic databases:\\nØ\\nIEEE Xplore\\n\\nØ\\nScienceDirect\\n\\nØ\\nWeb of Science\\n\\nØ\\nScopus\\n\\nØ\\nGoogle Scholar\\n\\nØ\\nACM Digital Library\\n\\n\\nThe search terms established previously were employed to search for journal papers and conference papers in the six electronic databases. The search was conducted on the first six databases covering title, abstract, and keywords. For Google Scholar, only title was searched since the full text search will return millions of irrelevant records. We limited the search to the period from 2017 to 2023, because the most relevant study of the application of ML techniques in SIS domain was launched just in the early 2017.\\n\\n4.3. search process\\nSLR necessitates a comprehensive search of all relevant sources. That's why, we defined the search process and split it into the following two phases (note that the relevant papers are those papers that verify the selection criteria defined in the next section).\\n•\\nSearch stage 1: A thorough search was launched on the six electronic database sources and the returned results (papers) were assembled as sets of prospective papers.\\n\\n•\\nSearch stage 2: The reference lists of all relevant papers were perused to detect additional relevant papers and then, if any, combine them with the ones in stage 1.\\n\\n\\nSoftware package Mendeley (https://www.mendeley.com) was used to store and manage the search results. We identified 55 relevant papers according to the search process. The detailed search process and the number of papers identified at each phase are shown in Fig. 2.\\n\\nFig. 2\\nDownload : Download high-res image (254KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 2. Search and selection process.\\n\\n5. Study selection\\nFrom the first search stage, 1071 prospective studies were realized. Since many of the candidate papers provide no information useful to address the research questions raised by this review, further filtering is needed to identify the relevant papers belong the candidate papers by using the inclusion and the exclusion criteria (defined below). This is exactly what study selection aims to do. Specifically, as illustrated in Fig. 2.\\n\\nWe defined the following inclusion and exclusion criteria, which had been refined through pilot selection. We carried out the study selection by reading the titles, abstracts, or full text of the papers.\\n\\nInclusion criteria:\\n•\\nEmpirical studies using the ML techniques for SIS.\\n\\n•\\nEmpirical studies using at least two ML models for SIS.\\n\\n•\\nEmpirical studies combining the ML and non-ML techniques.\\n\\n•\\nFor duplicate publications of the same study, only the most complete and newest one will be included.\\n\\n•\\nFor study that has both conference version and journal version, only the journal version will be included.\\n\\n\\nExclusion criteria:\\n•\\nStudies without empirical analysis or results of use of the ML techniques for SIS.\\n\\n•\\nStudies using the ML techniques in context other than SIS.\\n\\n•\\nReview studies.\\n\\n\\nTwo researchers conducted independent evaluations to test the aforementioned inclusion and exclusion criteria. Through thorough discussions, they arrived at a mutual decision. In instances of uncertainty, the complete texts of the studies were reviewed, leading to a final determination regarding their inclusion or exclusion. Furthermore, any duplicate studies by a specific author with identical results were eliminated. Ultimately, a total of 55 studies were selected by employing the aforementioned selection criteria.\\n\\n6. Data extraction and data synthesis\\nFor each of the selected studies, we completed a form to extract pertinent information. The purpose of using the data extraction form was to identify which research question was addressed by each selected study. The extracted data included details such as author names, titles, publishing information, independent variables (metrics), and the ML techniques employed. By analyzing the data extraction cards, we could determine the specific research questions that each selected study aimed to answer. These cards served as a means to gather information from the selected studies.\\n\\nTwo independent researchers collected the necessary information for each selected study using the data extraction cards. They compared their findings, and in case of any discrepancies, additional researchers were consulted to resolve any disagreements. The resulting data was then saved in an Excel file for future use during the data synthesis process.\\n\\nThe main objective of data synthesis was to combine and consolidate the findings and results from the selected studies to formulate responses and address the research questions. By aggregating studies that presented similar viewpoints and comparable results, we obtained research evidence that contributed to obtaining conclusive answers.\\n\\nDuring the synthesis process, we meticulously scrutinized and evaluated both quantitative and qualitative data. The quantitative data encompassed various performance metrics, such as AUC, prediction accuracy, while the qualitative data included the strengths and weaknesses of the ML methods and the categorization of different ML techniques. To address the research questions, we employed visualization techniques, such as line graphs, box plots, pie charts, and bar charts. Additionally, we used tables to summarize and present the results.\\n\\n7. Results and discussion\\nThis section presents the results obtained from selected studies for smart irrigation system. First, we present the overview of each selected study. Second, the answers to the review research questions are provided in each sub-section. Then we provide the discussion and interpretation of the results in the view of the facts obtained from each selected study.\\n\\n8.

The technical and application challenges are enormous since IoT platforms enable complex real-time control systems that combine the use of communication infrastructure, hardware, software, analytical techniques, and application knowledge combined into multiple layers. One of the key technical challenges is to realize the expected IoT impacts on systems, as IoT allows them to become service mashups, connecting things as services. Consequently, system development will become dynamic plug-and-play interoperable service composition, and system logic will become service orchestration. Overall, IoT allows solution flexibility to fulfill custom application needs.\\n\\nIn the context of agriculture, irrigation is a key task to guarantee adequate crop yield by avoiding under- and over-watering. Moreover, it is an important cost driver, as the energy to transport water and to operate irrigation equipment is costly – in some places, even the water itself is costly. Smart irrigation seeks to apply IoT and analytical methods to leverage precision irrigation, aiming optimal cost effectiveness to the farmer by flowing the water in the proper amount to places where and when it is needed.\\n\\nIn this article we introduce the concept of a flexible IoT-machine learning (ML) platform, wherein IoT and ML components are connected as services in an application context, allowing adaptable solutions to fulfill application needs. This approach benefits IoT professionals, as they can easily develop and deploy complex solutions involving devices, communication, data management, analytics, and application elements.\\n\\nIn particular, our work on this concept has resulted in a platform called SWAMP1 that implements our flexible IoT-ML architecture toward the smart irrigation problem. This allows highly customizable soil water management solutions, involving flexible connectivity among data, physical models, and ML algorithms oriented to solve application key tasks, such as water need estimation and irrigation planning and operation. We call this concept flexible data-driven soil water management, which in practice allows suitable solutions to a great variety of soil, plant, and regional weather characteristics. This approach benefits the farmer, as a highly customizable smart irrigation solution may reduce water and energy usage and mitigate crop yield risks as it keeps soil water content at healthy levels for plants.\\n\\nIn the remainder of this article, we compare our approach to other practical IoT research projects, provide details on our flexible platform applied to precision irrigation, describe our flexible ML approach to address precision irrigation tasks, highlight the potential impacts of our approach to IoT professionals and farmers, and summarize our main contributions.\\n\\nRelated Work\\nIn recent years, different academic and commercial initiatives have emerged, aiming to incorporate IoT and ML into the agriculture. IoF2020 (www.iof2020.eu)2 and Dragon (www.data-dragon.eu) are two projects funded by the European Union for developing IoT platforms for agrifood. IoF2020 is organized into five sectors that adopt different solutions: arable crops, dairy, vegetables, fruits, and meat. Arable crops use sensors to monitor production and intelligent analysis of images to assess crop development. GPS data from cattle neck collars or livestock movements monitor dairy chain, and ML is used for early lameness detection. IoT devices track the production chain of vegetables, fruits, and meat. Dragon aims to integrate IoT data with phenomics, genomics, and metagenomics data associated with ML methods to increase production.\\n\\nOther recent academic studies include a platform for precision agriculture and experimentation in turmeric cultivation [1]. The platform provides a graphical interface for connecting sensors and actuators and uses analytical methods to analyze the delay of messages. Another study uses thermal images generated by drones and transmitted throughout a cloud-fog system to identify non-uniform irrigation zones [2].\\n\\nCommercial companies are also putting some of these ideas into the market. Examples include Agrosmart (www.agrosmart.com.br) in Brazil, Agricolus (www.agricolus.com) in Italy, and Cropmetrics (www.cropmetrics.com) in the United States. Among other technologies, they use soil sensors, weather stations, and weather forecasts for irrigation advising. However, their underlying approaches for water need estimation and irrigation optimization and operation are not available.\\n\\nDespite the richness of recent approaches adopting IoT in the agri-food chain, they do not yet fully explore: (a) the architectural aspects to hold flexible solutions involving IoT and ML components and (b) the potential of the collected data for a more accurate analysis of water needs. In this article, we advocate that data-intensive methods provided by ML algorithms, in combination with IoT technologies and weather-soil-atmosphere simulations, can provide a considerable impact in precision irrigation and its solution deployment.\\n\\nA Flexible IoT-ML Platform for Smart Irrigation\\nThe success of next generation systems for precision irrigation based on IoT technologies coupled with intelligent ML data processing techniques depends on the ability of the solution to adapt to different contexts found in farms. A flexible IoT-ML platform must allow different deployment configurations of hardware, software, and communication technologies, customized to deal with the requirements and constraints of different settings, countries, climate, soils, and crops. Here we advocate that an IoT-ML infrastructure for providing smart irrigation services be defined by two complementary dimensions, namely core components and deployment locations. Core components are a set of software, hardware, and communication technologies, such as soil moisture sensor probes, long-range WAN (LoRaWAN) [3], Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) [4], LoRa Server (www.loraserver.io), FIWARE [5], and SEPA [6], as well as specific services for water need estimation and irrigation planning and operation.\\n\\nOn the other hand, deployment locations define where core components can be placed, and how they communicate with each other. This generates distinctive configuration scenarios for different deployments. Locations follow an IoT computing continuum, composed of things (sensors and actuators), mist (field nodes such as radio gateways), fog (farm on-premise computing infrastructure), cloud (data storage and processing), and terminal (a smartphone, tablet, or laptop where the end user interacts with the application). The five instances of this continuum define the end-to-end information path starting with data collected by sensors up to commands executed by actuators. The five instances might not necessarily be present in all scenarios. Rather, depending on farm characteristics, requirements, and constraints, fog or cloud may not be present. This feature provides additional flexibility to the IoT-ML platform, as the differences are understood, and the platform adapts to the farm and not the opposite.\\n\\nFigure 1 depicts the IoT infrastructure for providing smart irrigation services, composed of core components and deployment locations. In smart agriculture, each farm has particular objectives and characteristics, so different deployment configurations may be used, representing instances of the same platform. Figure 1 presents a simpler version of the deployment of the IoT-ML platform where locations are thing, mist, cloud, and terminal (i.e., no fog is used). This configuration was chosen for simplicity and a farmer's choice of not hosting anyon-premises infrastructure.\\n\\nFigure 1. - IoT-ML platform overview and end-to-end data path for a smart irrigation scenario.\\nFigure 1.\\nIoT-ML platform overview and end-to-end data path for a smart irrigation scenario.\\n\\nIn Fig. 1, the numbers in blue circles represent a simplified sequence of the end-to-end data flow through this deployment of the IoT-ML platform. Soil moisture sensors send data via LoRaWAN to the gateway installed in the mist node. Particularly for the SWAMP Project, we have built a custom-made three-depth soil moisture sensor, but also use commercial sensors from Libelium (www.libelium.com) and Meter (www.metergroup.com). A weather station also sends data to the mist node via a serial wired interface (1). From there, the mist node forwards data via 4G through the Internet directly to the cloud (2).\\n\\nWithin the cloud, sensor data are treated by the LoRaWAN server and sent to the IoT protocol translator (3), such as a FIWARE IoT Agent. Weather data goes directly to the IoT protocol translator using the Ultralight 2.0 protocol, as well as weather forecasts obtained from an external service. The Translator converts the three different types of input data – soil, weather conditions, and weather forecast – into the format of the particular IoT underlying platform transmitting them to the context broker (4) (e.g., NGSI JSON format for FIWARE Orion). Once data arrives at the context broker, it is forwarded to time series storage (5) that makes it available for further processing (e.g., FIWARE QuantumLeap using CrateDB), where the first part of the end-to-end data flow ends. Here, depending on the volume and velocity of data, the time series storage may be replaced by a distributed data pipeline (e.g., Apache Kafka) connected to a big data processing system (e.g., Apache Spark). However, for most smart agriculture scenarios dealing with individual farms with hundreds of sensors, time series storage is a lightweight solution that provides adequate performance.\\n\\nThe water need estimation component obtains soil moisture, weather conditions, and weather forecast data from the time series storage (6) to generate ideal crop water need estimates. Water need estimation is further divided into physical and ML models, further explained in the next section. The estimates are in turn used by irrigation planning to generate an optimized and real plan that is aware of different physical and financial constraints (7). Farmers are shown the irrigation plan via the Farmer App (8) and approve or change the irrigation plan that is sent back to irrigation operation (9), which controls the irrigation system. From there, irrigation commands follow the way back to the mist going through the context broker (10), IoT protocol translator (11), and Inter-net/4G (12). Finally, irrigation commands reach sprinklers, pumps, and valves (13).\\n\\nShould the fog be present in a different scenario, the end-to-end communication would be preserved with small changes, as some components would be deployed on-premises in the farm office where the fog node is located, such as the LoRaWAN server. This scenario includes the direct operation of the irrigation system. In alternative scenarios, the irrigation plan either interacts with existing third-party irrigation systems (e.g., Netafim – www.netafim.com – or Focking – www.fockink.ind.br) already installed on the farm or even used by farmers to operate the irrigation systems manually. These options for interacting with an irrigation system are common, and we assume they are generic enough to represent an IoT ecosystem for smart irrigation.\\n\\nFlexible Data-Driven Soil Water Management\\nOver the last decades, data-driven soil water management has been accomplished using physical models3 or triggering soil moisture sensors data4 [7]. However, as IoT enables more abundant data, with major spatial and temporal granularity and low latency, it increasingly allows the rise of data-driven approaches. Here, a key challenge is how to make all analytical techniques (e.g., physical models and ML) available to work together in a flexible IoT platform, considering that each crop, type of soil, and region may demand a different solution. In this sense, our work aims to show the roles that these analytical techniques can play in soil water management, and how they can be flexibly assembled together. Our approach is based on two main characteristics:\\n\\nSolution flexibility: Modularized components are integrated as services in the IoT platform, allowing solution flexibility.\\n\\nIncreased ML relevance: Analytical solutions can be assembled from traditional physical approaches, and modern ML and simulation ones, and even by combining them. Benefits of this approach are not only improved irrigation plans, but also self-improved platforms that learn from experience.\\n\\nSoil water management is performed in two phases, namely water need estimation and irrigation planning.\\n\\nWater Need Estimation\\nThe precision irrigation problem can be modeled as the soil water balance system at the root zone, where the soil water content is the result of the balance between water content level and a series of mechanisms that make this level increase or decrease (soil water dynamics) [8]. IoT provides the ability to monitor water content levels and dynamics, while soil water management systems seek to maintain water content in an optimal range [7].\\n\\nFigure 2 depicts the water need estimation process, divided into two key activities:\\n\\nSoil water content and dynamics estimation: This consists of estimating soil water content and dynamics through:\\n\\nDirect measurement of soil water content, rainfall, irrigation, and so on\\n\\nPhysical models of soil water dynamics applied over the collected data (weather data mainly) and soil and crop characteristics\\n\\nSoil water need forecast: This consists of calculating soil water content forecasts and water need forecasts for each moment of a planning horizon, using techniques such as simulation and ML algorithms:\\n\\nSimulation is appropriated when working with physical models, iteratively applied to simulate future data points [9].\\n\\nML takes advantage of data from multiple time series (soil moisture, soil water balance, soil characteristics, and weather data) of direct sensor readings or from variables derived out of physical models. Weather forecast data, provided by external services, can also be used. Different multivariate forecasting methods can be used to handle these multiple time series [10], [11].\\n\\nFigure 2. - Water need estimation process.\\nFigure 2.\\nWater need estimation process.\\n\\nThe process depicted in Fig. 2 allows flexibility once it allows different components combinations, as they are implemented as services in the platform. It is also possible to customize each combination, as they have numerous options inside them (i.e., different physical models and ML techniques).\\n\\nAs an example, the SWAMP project provides two customized analytical solutions among all combination possibilities to fit the characteristics and needs of different pilots. One of them, called CRITERIA-1D [9], uses physical models and simulation, wherein soil water dynamics models (physical models) are the input to soil simulation that generates soil water content and water need forecasts. Another solution uses direct measurements, physical models, ML, and simulation, wherein the main input is direct measurement of soil moisture enriched by an evapotranspiration5 model (physical model) [7] as the main soil water balance contributor. ML techniques6, such as Panel VAR [10] and RNN-LSTM [11], are used for the processing of soil water content and water need forecasts, and simulation to test alternative irrigation scenarios. Note that the latter uses Panel VAR and RNN-LSTM, respectively, a traditional and a cutting-edge technique for time series, thus highlighting the solution flexibility in exploring different ML techniques as they gain relevance.\\n\\nIrrigation Planning and Operation\\nThe water need estimation models provide what can be called the ideal irrigation. There are, however, other aspects that need to be considered when conceiving an actual irrigation plan, that is, a plan that can be put in place in the farm, which include:\\n\\nWater availability: Water scarcity is a problem in various parts of the planet. Water quotas or supply schedules might not allow the ideal amount of water to be irrigated in time. If the needed amount of water is not available, the irrigation plan should allocate the existing water so that the best economic return to the farmer is achieved.\\n\\nCosts of irrigation: Even if the water comes from private reservoirs, irrigation is not free. Pumping the water to the fields consumes energy, and its cost has an impact on the farmer's bottom line. For example, in certain regions of Brazil, the energy bill can account for up to 30 percent of the production cost. A cost-aware plan should avoid irrigation when tariffs are higher.\\n\\nLimitation of the irrigation systems: Irrigation methods differ in how much of the irrigated water actually reaches the plants: furrow irrigation has 60 percent efficiency, while sprinkler irrigation reaches 75 percent [12]. Other aspects of the irrigation infrastructure need to be considered when planning: maximum pumping capacity of the farm, uniformity of irrigation, and soil variability, among others.\\n\\nFigure 3 presents a modular approach that separates irrigation planning from operation, completing the data flow shown in Fig. 2. There are three main modules:\\n\\nIrrigation planning: Computes the timing and water volume of irrigation events that best address the crop needs, while being aware of operational constraints and economic interests. Linear and nonlinear programming techniques can be used, as well as approximate solutions such as those provided by metaheuristics [13].\\n\\nIrrigation operation: Communicates with the sensors and actuators installed in the farms, sending commands and monitoring the operation to ensure adherence to the plan. It controls the opening and closing of valves, the pressure at pumps, and so on, using the underlying IoT communication infrastructure to send commands. The use of standard IoT interfaces and protocols enables on-demand addition of sensors and actuators, smoothing the transition toward fully automated irrigation.\\n\\nSystem Model: Computes an updated model of the system behavior as far as irrigation is concerned. IoT devices (e.g., soil sensors, water meters) in combination with data-driven techniques enable estimating the actual irrigation efficiency, and planning accordingly.\\n\\nFigure 3. - General data flow between irrigation services.\\nFigure 3.\\nGeneral data flow between irrigation services.\\n\\nDiscussion and Lessons Learned\\nPhysical Models vs. Machine Learning\\nThe increasing use of IoT in precision irrigation brings spatial and temporal accuracy gain, as sensors can potentially be placed in all manageable locations on a farm. Thus, site-specific particularities can easily be considered, leveraging the exploration of data-driven approaches. In this context, the question of what would be the right combination of techniques to deliver adequate soil water management emerges. Do traditional approaches, such as using physical models or triggering soil moisture sensors data [7], still take place? Or is this the time to avoid physical models and use cutting-edge ML algorithms acting directly to data?\\n\\nOur vision is that there is no unique ideal analytical approach for all cases, as crops differ significantly in irrigation methods and in crop, soil, and regional weather characteristics. More than that, depending on crop culture or region, not all data features might be available or cost-effective. However, a discussion of the roles traditional and ML approaches can play in effective solutions can provide guidelines to discern the most appropriate alternatives to each application case.\\n\\nPhysical models have been extensively used in irrigation, bringing implicit agronomic knowledge, as they connect raw data features to specific and relevant features. Nevertheless, there are important limitations, as general models involve simplifications that often ignore local particularities, while site-specific models work well only regionally, and few models have adequate performance levels for different regions. Finally, the few models of general application that are flexible enough to address different conditions [7] are often complex and require many data features that are difficult to obtain.\\n\\nOn the other hand, pure ML approaches applied directly to IoT data seem promising, as cutting-edge deep learning is capable of capturing implicit knowledge from raw data in many application areas, as well as delivering highly customizable results [14]. For this reason, we believe that ML approaches will be extensively explored in scientific research in the coming years, allowing the emergence of truly cognitive smart irrigation systems. As such, our architecture approach, based on core components and deployment locations, gives the necessary flexibility not only to build customizable IoT-ML solutions, but also to assemble customizable data-driven solutions. For smart irrigation, we have shown that it is possible to use various combinations of analytical tools, including mixes of physical models, simulation (traditional approaches), and ML techniques.\\n\\nAs ML gains momentum, existing physical models may lose room because ML could implicitly capture from raw data the same information physical models provide. Instead, IoT's continuous growth might enhance the utilization of physical models, as they can calculate their outputs with better spatial and temporal granularity. Also, IoT tends to promote not only physical models but also ML. In summary, a futuristic vision may be that ML is well positioned for IoT-based applications. However, although ML seems to have a promising future for smart irrigation, we are still at the beginning of its exploration, and we need reliable data that now is still generated by physical models or a combination of data and ML techniques.\\n\\nAll in all, considering the advantages and disadvantages of each side, we advocate that current solutions consider using both physical models and ML algorithms – physical models serving as feature engineering for ML approaches. We believe that physical models can aggregate agronomic knowledge that ML algorithms eventually cannot capture yet directly from raw data. Finally, as different physical models can potentially capture different aspects of reality, we recommend using multiple physical models, even for similar tasks. Then ML will hold the task of capturing valuable information from the features provided by the physical models to deliver more precise water need estimation.\\n\\nIntegrating Different Stakeholders\\nThe approach taken is the result of a joint and largely interdisciplinary effort, and the authors' ambition is to generate an impact on a wide community of stakeholders with the envisioned innovation. On one hand, the interoperability at the communication level provided by IoT is a key factor to promote a platform culture among not-computer-scientists, as it brings easy node deployment, data collection, and inter-researcher interaction. On the other hand, only with our flexible architecture approach due to the heterogeneities embedded in the agricultural scenario – heterogeneity of devices and simulation tools, but also farms and the stakeholders themselves – can the barriers be properly handled. Different stakeholders speak their own languages: for example, soil-moisture sensor data are numbers for computer scientists, bits for telecommunication professionals, voltage signals for electronic engineers, while the end users expect volumetric soil moisture values. As the calibration of these sensors is soil-type-dependent, geologists, agronomists, and other researchers must take part in the game of this context-dependent calibration process.\\n\\nAltogether, the smooth interplay between actors with different skills and habits is a key success factor. Each stakeholder needs specific and mostly mobile services, with the appropriate human-machine interface, if we want to deploy the appropriate level of automation with the man in the loop, as required in today's agriculture. Services need to be organized like a chain of tools that mutually exchange information and understand each other thanks to a shared information model based on emerging ontologies. This shared data model fosters smooth and sustainable innovation because the tool chain may easily be extended to provide new capabilities and value propositions, and attract new stakeholders.\\n\\nImpacts\\nFor IoT Professionals\\nOur approach incorporates the ML pipeline into the IoT continuum by using a structure of services deployed as containers that exchange messages through the FIWARE NGSI unified data model. This scheme impacts IoT platform development and deployment in many aspects:\\n\\nAutomation: The platform provides a subscribe/notify mechanism for building automated data pipelines.\\n\\nTraceability: The storing of meta-data information about the model specifications and context of data used in the estimation allows keeping track of model forecasts, as well as quality indicators.\\n\\nPluggability: The integration of new or updated models is facilitated by the unified data model, consuming data and producing water need estimates in a standard way.\\n\\nFlexibility: The pluggability allows IoT professionals to compose different data workflows flexibly by using various components.\\n\\nHybrid environments: The architecture allows the use of different ML frameworks to train models, as well as hardcoded physical models.\\n\\nAll these aspects have been allowing a relatively simple deployment of our platform in all SWAMP pilots, each one with its characteristics and different specific goals. In Italy, the goal is to use farm data for water management and distribution (i.e., to share data outside the farm to create an even bigger system-of-systems). In Spain, the goal is to explore the limits of flexibility and precision in irrigation by going into a very fine-grained irrigation system where each sprinkler is an IoT node. In Bahia, Brazil, there is a large-scale use case with huge center-pivot irrigation systems, where the goal is to decrease operational costs through improved situational awareness. Near São Paulo, Brazil, the goal is to improve the quality of grapes and wine.\\n\\nFor Farmers\\nCurrently, in modern farms that rely on physical water need estimation models and respect soil variability, farmers are provided with irrigation plans for long periods, such as weeks, months, or even the entire season. Based on their accumulated experience and daily work in the field, they continuously adapt the irrigation plan to avoid crops suffering from water stress. In this scenario, the irrigation plan plays the role of an offline longer-term forecast that needs to be fitted into the reality of the farm. In a fully automated future agriculture scenario, the IoT-based smart irrigation system will precisely control every aspect of the use of water, adapting it to shorter-term periods according to instantaneous information coming from the field, which can be daily or even based on intra-day micro adjustments in the irrigation plan.\\n\\nBetween these two scenarios – current and future – lies a new IoT-enabled reality that will change the way farmers face irrigation. In any case, a requirement is that farmers always control the irrigation and are provided a wealth of real-time information to be able to make better decisions. To this end, we developed a smartphone app (Fig. 4) where farmers are informed of immediate water needs (Fig. 4a), measured and forecast water balance time series (Figure 4b), and the current soil moisture information for a 3-depth sensor probe (Fig. 4c). With this real-time status of the farm at hand, and equipped with the optimized irrigation plans computed by the system, the farmer can achieve better use of the water resources without harming productivity.\\n\\nFigure 4. - Farmer application screenshots.\\nFigure 4.\\nFarmer application screenshots.\\n\\nAs the system reliability and precision increase and earn the trust of farmers, they can slowly give more power to the system to make automated decisions. In other words, the application will allow farmers to express policies on how to behave whenever a new irrigation plan is generated.\\n\\nConclusion\\nIn this article, we present our flexible IoT-ML platform and highlight its scientific contribution over related work. The platform allows easy solution deployment involving IoT and ML components working in an application. Our real case is a smart irrigation application, where we exemplify how a solution can be built and customized depending on site-specific needs. Special attention was given to how the platform enables more exploration of ML-based solutions and on how it can positively impact IoT professionals' and farmers' needs. SWAMP project pilots have just been deployed; they are operating properly, and data is being collected. The next step, expected by the end of 2020, is to analyze the data and disseminate quantitative impact results.\", 'unique_identifier': 72}\n",

The world population is increasing at a very fast rate and with increase in population the need for food increases briskly. Traditional methods used by farmers aren't sufficient enough to serve the increasing demand and so they have to hamper the soil by using harmful pesticides in an intensified manner. This affects the agricultural practice a lot and in the end the land remains barren with no fertility. This paper talks about different automation practices like IOT, Wireless Communications, Machine learning and Artificial Intelligence, Deep learning. There are some areas which are causing the problems to agriculture field like crop diseases, lack of storage management, pesticide control, weed management, lack of irrigation and water management and all this problems can be solved by above mentioned different techniques. Today, there is an urgent need to decipher the issues like use of harmful pesticides, controlled irrigation, control on pollution and effects of environment in agricultural practice. Automation of farming practices has proved to increase the gain from the soil and also has strengthened the soil fertility. This paper surveys the work of many researchers to get a brief overview about the current implementation of automation in agriculture. The paper also discusses a proposed system which can be implemented in botanical farm for flower and leaf identification and watering using IOT.\\n\\nPrevious article in issueNext article in issue\\nKeywords\\nAutomation artificial intelligenceIrrigationMachine learning\\n1. Introduction\\nWith the advent of technology in this digital world, we humans have pushed our limit of the thinking process and are trying to coalesce normal brain with an artificial one. This continuing exploration gave birth to a whole new field Artificial intelligence. It is the process by which a human can make an intelligent machine. AI comes under the domain area of computer science which can be able to discern its milieu and should thrive to maximize the rate of success. AI should be able to do work based on past learning. Deep learning, CNN, ANN, Machine learning are certain domains which enhances the machine work and helps to develop a more advance technology.\\n\\nThe term IOT is elucidated as “thing to thing” communication. The three main targets are communication, automation and cost saving in the system. Dr. D.K. Sreekantha, Kavya.A.M provides the in-depth application of IOT in the field of agriculture and how it can be helpful to the humans.\\n\\nAI has penetrated in medical science, education, finance, agriculture, industry, security, and many other sectors. Implementation of AI involves learning process of machines. This brings us to a sub-domain in this AI field “Machine learning”. The sole purpose of machine learning is to feed the machine with data from past experiences and statistical data so that it can perform its assigned task to solve a particular problem. There are many applications which exist today which includes analyzing of data from past data and experience, speech and face recognition, weather prediction, medical diagnostics. It is because of machine learning that the domain of big data and data science has evolved to such a great extent. Machine learning is a mathematical approach to build intelligent machines.\\n\\nAs AI stimulated, many new logics and method were invented and discovered which makes the process of problem- solving more simple. Such methods are listed below.\\n1.\\nFuzzy logic\\n\\n2.\\nArtificial neural networks (ANN)\\n\\n3.\\nNeuro-fuzzy logic\\n\\n4.\\nExpert systems\\n\\n\\nAmong all of these, the most widely used and constantly applied method for research purposes is ANN. Our human brain is the most complex part of the body. Based on the inter linked neural networks, electric signals traverses through the neurons with the help of axons. Synapses which are at the end of each node passes the signal ahead. ANN method was invented by keeping in mind the same concept of the working of the human brain. There are various algorithms of this approach such as for training this particular model algorithms like Silva and Almeida's algorithm, Delta-bar-delta, Rprop, The Dynamic Adaption algorithm, Quickprop are used based on its application. 9 neurons are used in the process. ANN is a task- based method which tells the system to operate based on some inbuilt task rather than a conventional computational programmed task. The architecture of ANN consists of three layers:\\n1.\\nInput layer\\n\\n2.\\nHidden (middle) layer\\n\\n3.\\nOutput layer (Fig. 1)\\n\\nFig. 1\\nDownload : Download high-res image (177KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 1. Artificial neural network layers.\\n\\n\\nFeedforward back propagation mechanism and its parameters are shown above: Input Layer–7, output layer-1, hidden layer-50, number of iterations – 1200. Activation layer- Sigmoidal function in hidden and output layer, linear function in input layer.\\n\\nMoreover, Artificial intelligence and machine learning are mostly hypothesis and theories. These are programming and algorithms. For the implementation of these algorithms and logic based concepts, there should be a hardware- software interface. The system through which this can be achieved is “Embedded systems”. Embedded systems are hardware built systems consisting of memory chips with custom software programmed in it (Fig. 2).\\n\\nFig. 2\\nDownload : Download high-res image (79KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 2. Embedded systems.\\n\\nThis paper encompasses the links which make embedded systems and AI coherent with the agriculture sector. Implementation of AI and expert systems in agriculture is a narrowly defined subject. This topic was discussed by McKinion and Lemmon (1985). Agriculture is the essential part of any country. At present South Korea, China, North America are investing trillions of money for development in the agriculture sector and implementing more advance technologies. The population is increasing at a very high rate which is directly related to the increase in the demand for food. India is a rich source for food crops and especially for species. The agriculture sector is one of the most sensitive sectors of the Indian economy, supporting all other sectors and spreading its importance in far- reaching areas. With the advent of technology in other industries, it is a very crucial point to implement automation in agriculture.\\n\\nThe pressure on the agriculture sector will increase with the continuing expansion of the human population and so agri-technology and precision farming have gained much importance in today's world. This are also termed as digital agriculture which means the use of hi-tech computer systems to calculate different parameters such as weed detection, crop prediction, yield detection, crop quality and many more machine learning techniques (Liakos et al., 2018). This paper discusses about the different applications of ANN, ML, and IOT in agriculture and many models which helps in precision farming.\\n\\n2. Literature survey\\nOver the past 50\\u202fyears, there has been a sustainable development in artificial intelligence due to its robustness in the application and is pervasive in every field. One such field is agriculture.\\n\\nAgriculture faces many challenges on a daily basis and is not smooth running business. Some of the pith problems faced by farmers from seed sowing to harvesting of crops are as follows:\\n1.\\nCrop diseases infestations\\n\\n2.\\nLack of storage management.\\n\\n3.\\nPesticide control\\n\\n4.\\nWeed management\\n\\n5.\\nLack of irrigation and drainage facilities.\\n\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence and Machine learning has penetrated each and every category mentioned above. Bannerjee et al. (2018) segregated advancements in AI category wise and gave a brief overview on various AI techniques. Computers and technology started penetrating in this sector from 1983 onwards. Since then, there have been many suggestions and proposed systems for betterment in agriculture from the database to decision making process. Filtering out every process, only AI based systems have proved to be the most feasible and reliable one. The AI- based method does not generalize the problem and gives a particular solution to a particular defined complex problem. The literature survey covers major breakthroughs in the domain of agriculture from early 1980s to 2018. The paper discusses more than fifty advancement in technologies in the sub domain of agriculture. First it discusses penetration of Artificial neural networks and expert systems to solve above mentioned problems, then machine learning and fuzzy logic system. Lastly it covers automation and IOT in the agriculture.\\n\\n3. Artificial neural networks in agriculture\\nArtificial neural networks have been incorporated in the agriculture sector many times due to its advantages over traditional systems. The main benefit of neural networks is they can predict and forecast on the base of parallel reasoning. Instead of thoroughly programming, neural networks can be trained. Gliever and Slaughter (2001) used ANN to differentiate weeds from the crops. Maier and Dandy (2000) used neural networks for forecasting water resources variables.\\n\\nSong and He (2005) brought together expert systems and Artificial neural networks in predicting nutrition level in the crop. Traditional ES (Expert systems) have considerable backdrops when it is being implemented. Use of ANN makes it up to all glitches of ES. The whole system is built on a single chip computer. Neural networks always prove to be the best when it comes to predicting methods. Neural networks can predict the complex mappings if a reliable set of variables are fed. To dodge the problems of frost formation in the fields of the island of Sicily, Robinson and Mort (1997) developed a prediction model using neural networks. The model is first to feed with the raw data like humidity, temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, wind direction (all these data were taken from 1980 to 1983). Then, the data gathered got converted into binary data. These data, now are divided into two strings (input and output for the neural network model). The back-propagation network was used as a neural network predictor. A total of 10 trial sets were developed and trained by the model initially. The frost was predicted more efficiently when a range of values of parameters (mentioned above) was taken rather than single values.\\n\\nWithin the span of three years, two expert systems had been developed to increase the production of cotton crop. First, COMAX. In 1986, Lemmon made a successful attempt in developing an expert system called Comax (COtton Management eXpert). Lemmon, being the pioneer in AI in agriculture sector, develped a program called Gossym which is microcomputer friendly and bolster the use of Comax (Lemmon, 1986). For the first ever, the expert system (Comax) was successfully integrated with a computer model (Gossym) and simulated for the growth of cotton crops. This expert system was developed in order to operate continuosly throughout the year in cotton crop fields. Comax takes three parameters of the field into consideration; scheduling of irrigation, maintaining nitrogen content in the field, and growth in the cotton crop.\\n\\nSecond, COTFLEX. Another expert system for the cotton crop was developed by Stone and Toman (1989). The system was named as COTFLEX. The system was made worked on Pyramid 90× computer which used UNIX as its operating system. The system incorporated the field and farm databases to provide important information regarding the cotton crop to the farmer so that it becomes easy for the grower to take critical and tactical decisions. The system developed in Texas, and it created simulation models and databases in the rule-based expert system to help Texan farmers take prudent economic and lucrative decisions. After successful testings, COTFLEX was imported to IBM microcomputer and was made open for the use.\\n\\nBatchelor et al. (1989) discusses about the soyabean crop growth model which is defined as SMARTSOY in the paper and the model is called SOYGRO. The model is explained by knowledge based approach where it is divided into two approaches first being the positivistic approach stating the attempts to duplicate the processes of domain experts in order to come to a conclusion while the second approach being the normative approach which attempts to duplicate the conclusions excluding the processes of the domain experts. The damages caused by insects are determined by systematic method for determining the damage rates and the cost control. Here, the positivistic and normative approach collapses because the later method helps it the selection of insecticide and application rate. However, the systematic method does not help to find the insect damage rate on yield. This is a major drawback for generating recommendation because we need to mix both the approach as the yield reduction is calculated by previous experiences of the similar insect attack, pesticides used and the outcomes of the crops in the end. The goal to generate recommendation specifically for soyabean crop is based on calculation of the damage rate and the cost to treat the plant and gain the yield. This calculation is derived by both the approaches.\\n\\nAn expert system PRITHVI based on fuzzy logic was developed in Rajasthan, India by Prakash et al. (2013). The system was designed explicitly for Soybeans crop. This system gathered its knowledge base from agricultural officers, published literature, and experts of soybean crops. Fuzzy logic was considered in studying the whole system and advising the farmer as an expert. PRITHVI was divided into five modules. The main aim of developing this expert system was to help the farmers in the region increase their soybean production. The system used MATLAB as a user interface module.\\n\\nResearchers developed an expert system which helped the farmers with when to spray insectisides on the apple fruit to avoid the damage due to insects and atmosphere. The system was named as POMME. Along with the time, it also advised the farmers what to spray. Instead of theoretical values from the infection table, here apple scab disease cycle model was used in POMME. The results of the system were satisfactory and system was approved by the experts who had used it on trial basis. (Roach et al., 1987).\\n\\nA method is suggesting the use of ANN algorithms for crop prediction in smartphones had been successfully tested in 2016 by researchers Ravichandran and Koteshwari. A prediction model was developed. As mentioned above, the prediction model of this system had three layers (Ravichandran and Koteshwari, 2016). The efficiency of the model was dependent on the number of the hidden layers. First and foremost, the ANN model was built and trained using various algorithms such as Silva and Almeida's algorithms, Delta-bar-delta, Rprop, and various other to find the most favourable configuration. Trial and error method was implemented to choose the number of hidden layers. There should be a précised way to scrutinize the selection of some hidden layers because the prediction system's accuracy is dependent on the number of hidden layers. It was observed in the research that more the number of hidden layers in the ANN model; the more accurate were the prediction.\\n\\nSince the purpose of the system was to make it handy for the farmers, it is developed on APK platform. The source code was written in Eclipse with Java codes in the backhand, and the algorithm was developed using Matlab and ANN toolbox. The whole file was then extracted on the Android platform so that it can be utilized by smartphones. Besides suggesting the crop to the farmer, the system also has the additional advantage of advising the farmer for the fertilizer to be used if the farmer wishes to use the crop of his choice. (Ravichandran and Koteshwari, 2016) (Fig. 3).\\n\\nFig. 3\\nDownload : Download high-res image (244KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 3. Flowchart of ANN-based crop predictor using smartphones.\\n\\nEvapotranspiration process is imperative for maintaining the stability in the hydrologic cycle, sustainable irrigation method, and water management. Parameters- Elevation, Mean daily Temperature, Max. daily temperature, Min. daily temperature, Wind Speed, Relatuve Humidity, Sunshine Hours, Daylight hours, Latitude, Condition coefficient. There are more than 20 established method to determine ET which is dependent on several parameters.\\n\\nA profound study was carried out in the valley of Dehradun; India was assessing the importance of the addition of ANN in several techniques of estimation of ET. Researchers gathered monthly climate data from the Forest research institute (FRI) Dehradun for ET estimation. The methods on which the algorithms were applied were: 1. Penman-Monteith method 2. Levenberg-Marquardt back propagation. It was observed that increasing the number of hidden layers in the system resulted in instability in the ET estimation. So, training function with optimum trial and error method is to be chosen for the overall optimized estimation of ET. It was observed that out of six training algorithms of ANN model, function training with 75% data feed in it was precise and had the best number of neurons. Furthermore, there was a gauging between PM method and ANN model with the single layer feed forward back propagation algorithm. ANN model was designed and developed using Matlab. Six algorithms were conjured and assessed. As evapotranspiration is of vital importance in irrigation and water management, this research manifested the predictive prowess of ANN structure if implemented correctly. (Nema et al., 2017).\\n\\nFurthermore, also a method was created to discriminate weed from crops with the help of image analysis and neural networks. It had the accuracy of more than 75% without any beforehand plant information fed into the system. (Aitkenhead et al., 2003). Shahzadi et al. (2016) developed expert systems based smart agriculture system. The concept of IoT in this system was to send the data to the server so that actuators of the field should be able to take appropriate decisions. For that, the server should be intelligent enough to take decisions independently. This system consists of temperature, humidity, leaf wetness, and soil sensors. It only gives the information about the field and doesn't act on the irrigation process.\\n\\nArif et al. (2012) developed two ANN models to estimate soil moisture in Paddy fields using decidedly less meteorological data. Both these models were then corroborated and validated by studying observed and estimated soil moisture values. The first ANN model was generated to get the estimate ET. The help of minimum, average, and the maximum air temperature was taken. To develop the second model, solar radiation, precipitation, and air temperature data was gathered. Both these models resulted in the accurate and reliable estimation of soil moisture in the paddy fields by using the least meteorological data, less labor and time consumption.\\n\\nHinnell et al. (2010) discuss the neuro drip irrigation systems where ANNs were developed to predict the spatial water distribution in the subsurface. For drip irrigation method to properly function, water distribution in the lower level of the soil is of the grave importance. Here, ANNs makes the prediction which comes handy for the user which in turn results in the fast decision-making process. ANN models give the result of wetting patterns (first and second) after the soil is infiltrated with the water from the emitter which is on the surface of the land. Thus, the ANN model provides continuous patterns to the user. Also, researchers developed a model to study the yield of the maize crop. A multi-layered feedforward ANN (MLFANN) is used. To fuel such network, learning algorithms like GDA (gradient descent algorithms) and CGDA (Conjugate gradient descent algorithm) are employed. Both the algorithms have been written and simulated in the MATLAB using nueral network toolbox (Singh and Prajneshu, 2008).\\n\\nPrecision agriculture and WSN applications combine an exciting new area of research that will greatly improve quality in agricultural production, precision irrigation and will have dramatic reduction in cost needed. Furthermore, the ease of deployment and system maintenance, monitoring opens the way for the acceptation of WSN systems in precision agriculture. Using the proposed methodology, in finding the optimal sensor topology, we contrive to lower implementation cost and thus make WSN a more appealing solution for all kinds of fields and cultivations. (Keshtgari and Deljoo, 2012).\\n\\n4. Automation and wireless system networks in agriculture\\nIt is imperative for any sector to evolve with time. The agriculture sector had to adapt the breakthroughs and inventions which came along in automation field. Yong et al. (2018) came forward with emerging research area of embedded intelligence (EI). Embedded intelligence in agriculture sector includes smart farming, smart crop management, smart irrigation and smart greenhouses. It is necessary for a nation to include these growing technologies in agriculture sector for growth of a nation as many sectors are inter-dependent on agriculture. Also, researchers of this paper demonstrated Technology roadmap (TRM) which in turn clarifies the qualms regarding the areas of agriculture mentioned above (smart farming, smart irrigation etc).\\n\\nTaking into consideration the socio and economic vitality of agriculture in India, researchers Patil and Thorat (2016) developed a system which predicted grape disease beforehand. Any anomaly in the grape plant was noticed only after it was infected and this had a considerable deteriorating effect on the whole vineyard. The system employed various sensors such as temperature sensor, leaf wetness sensors, and humidity sensors in the vineyard. These sensors send the data sensed to the database in the ZigBee server which is linked to the sensors. Deployment of Wireless System Network (WSN) in any field needs to satisfy certain criteria and Zigbee alliance has developed open global standards called ZIGBEE. Zigbee compliances of four layers namely physical layer, medium access control layer, network layer, application layer as stated. The three devices: Zigbee Co-coordinator (ZC), Zigbee Router(ZR), Zigbee End Device(ZED) has different function in the WSN. Kalaivani et al. (2011) discusses end to end approach of Zigbee in agriculture. The server will store the data. The server is commissioned with a hidden Markov model algorithm in it. This algorithm is present to train the normal data sensed by the sensors and report any aberration in temperature, humidity or leaf wetness which can result in grape disease to farmer via SMS. Machine learning is blended in the system beforehand for astute deduction of disease in grapes. The additional advantage of this system is it also suggests the farmer pesticides and pacifies manual effort in the detection of disease. (Patil and Thorat, 2016). While a similar method of machine learning was employed in monitoring the growth of Paddy crops. This system was developed for increasing the yield and productivity of paddy crops. It also proved to be cost effective and durable. (Kait et al., 2007) (Fig. 4).\\n\\nFig. 4\\nDownload : Download high-res image (163KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 4.

Different type of sensors used for detection.\\n\\nIn one of the research conducted in Ankara, Turkey, implementing IIS (intelligent irrigation system), numerous positive perks were observed such as less moisture and temperature stress on soil, efficient water consumption, and neglecting human intervention in case of flood irrigation. The developed system works on three units. Base unit (BU), Valve unit (VU), and Sensor unit (SU). The whole system is powered by solar panels. After the successful installation of every unit, BU will send the address to which the data is to be sent to SU. Sensors from the SU will sense the moisture content and send the detected data to a specific address in the BU. If required, BU will send a signal to VU so that it can calibrate the position of the valve in order to provide the soil with water. However, site- specific use of automatic irrigation system took birth in the early 21st century; this method proved to be a significant success as it reduced the cost, feasibility, and complexity of the developed system. Furthermore, the unit can be set up which transports the fertilizers and pesticides in the field using the same method. For that, new kind of sensors would have to calibrate for transmitting accurate information. (Dursun and Ozden, 2011).\\n\\nResearch has been conducted to test the ET based, ICT based, and IIS based technology. In Riyadh, a research was conducted in Wheat and Tomato field in which both sprinkler and drip irrigation method were employed and tested with ICT as well as IIS. A graph of water depth versus growth period of the crop (weekly) was plotted for all three methods. A concise observation concluded that IIS was far more feasible in a matter of water usage than ICT and ET based system. It skyrocketed the frugality of water usage from 18% to a whopping 27%. (Al-Ghobari and Mohammad, 2011).\\n\\nAlso, Kodali and Sahu (2016) presented the use of Losant platform for monitoring the agriculture farmland and intimate the farmer via SMS or e-mail if any anomaly is observed by the system. Losant is a simple Iot based most powerful cloud platform. It offers real-time observation of data stored in it irrespective of the position of the field. Gutiérrez et al. (2014) came up with an automated irrigation system which uses the GPRS module as a communication device. The system is programmed into a microprocessor-based gateway which controls the water quantity. It was proved that water savings were 90% more than the conventional irrigation system. Kim et al. (2008) used a distributed wireless network for sensing and control of irrigation process from a remote location.\\n\\nTo improve efficiency, productivity, global market and to reduce human intervention, time and cost there is a need to divert towards new technology named Internet of Things. IoT is the network of devices to transfer the information without human involvement. Hence, to gain high productivity, IoT works in synergy with agriculture to obtain smart farming. Malavade and Akulwar (2016) focused on role of IoT in agriculture that leads to smart framing (Malavade and Akulwar, 2016).\\n\\nUse of wireless communication has changed the standards of communication in today's world and this can also raise the standards of agriculture automation. Logatchevl et al. (1998) has bifurcated the IOT gateway into different nodes such as actuator, sensor, interface and wireless link which give assistance to communication between them. Frequency estimation and the bandwidth requirement for this communication has also been elaborated which can be very beneficial for automation.\\n\\nImplementation of WSN (Wireless sensor network) in the agriculture sector and its different approaches is defined by this paper. Many different IEEE standards describe sensor networks, standards like IEEE 802.15.1 PAN/Bluetooth, IEEE 802.15.4 ZigBee and many more are necessary to know while planning its application. Researchers also discussed about IPV6 the Internet Protocol for wireless communication and also many hardware system for establishing a WSN. By using WSN, Precision farming is possible and the strategy is used for crop management. Different data is recorded by the sensors and stored in the system. The system is made to learn by the previous data from the sensors and future actions are taken accordingly (Shiravale and Bhagat, 2014).\\n\\nGanjegunte et al. (2012) studied three soil moisture sensors in Peacan crop field and came to a conclusion that the sensors used (ECH2O-5TE, Watermark 200SS and Tensiometer model R) need site specific calibration in order to bring accurate results.\\n\\nThe highlighting features of the paper presented by Gondchawar and Kawitkar (2016) includes smart GPS based remote controlled robot to perform tasks like; weeding, spraying, moisture sensing, bird and animal scaring, keeping vigilance, etc. Secondly, it includes smart irrigation with smart control based on real time field data. Thirdly, smart warehouse management which includes; temperature maintenance, humidity maintenance and theft detection in the warehouse. Controlling of all these operations will be through any remote smart device or computer connected to Internet and the operations will be performed by interfacing sensors, Wi-Fi or ZigBee modules, camera and actuators with micro-controller and raspberry pi.\\n\\nThermal Imaging is a noncontact and nonintrusive technique which analysis the surface temperature of the agricultural field and provides valuable feedback to the farmer. Roopaei et al. (2017) discussed the use of cloud based thermal imaging system which helps the irrigation by incorporating the performance of the equipment's and determine the area of field which requires the water most. The absence of uniformity will hamper the crop growth and thermal imaging can help to consolidate this loss. Also, Thermal Imaging is put to use in agriculture sector truly because of its wide application. The paper by Manickavasagan et al. (2005) discusses various application of thermal imaging like Pre-harvest operations, Field nursery, Irrigation scheduling, Yield Forecasting, Green house gases, Termite Attack, Farm machinery.\\n\\nKatariya et al. (2015) discussed the use of robot in the agriculture field. The robot is designed to follow the track of white line where actually there is a need to work and other surface is considered as black or brown. Working of robot is for spraying of pesticide, dropping of seed's, water supply and ploughing. In 2016 a group of researchers came up with e-Agriculture Application based on the framework consisting of KM-Knowledge base and Monitoring modules.The systems developed in IOT and Cloud Computing emphasizes on reliable architectures to provide timely information from the field over 3G or Wi-Fi. TI CC 3200 (RFID) launchpad was used to build the prototype with other necessary devices. Knowledge base has advantage over conventional IOT based systems; Knowledge Base is constructed to store vast complex structured and unstructured information to assist farmers or even an individual with no prior knowledge of farming. But finding right information in an appropriate manner is difficult where providing relevant knowledge should be distributed not only in an organised and complete manner, but also in absolute way. The knowledge based infrastructure allows adapting the changes in agriculture for a better extension and adding advisory services. (Mohanraj et al., 2016).\\n\\nAs degree of automation is required in each and every field so the human intervention becomes less and it is very important to design a layout in the early stages of the mechanics and electronics. Weed management is the issue which farmers face a lot and computer vision can help to solve the issue. There is particular difference between a weed and the desired crop.

The variable-rate systems can be utilized to efficiently use water. Although saving water is the biggest driving factor behind switching, but other advantages include: erosion prevention , reduced maintenance cost, avoiding fines for not using enough water, and limiting nutrient runoff [25]. Using the current irrigation systems, Chemigation, without involving any human, uniformly applies chemicals that too without danger of exposure. Smart irrigation system is accepted as beneficial technology; however, its adoption can be delayed because of cost involved in replacing or modifying the current equipment. A balanced approach would be to use cheaper valves in place of expensive pressure control nozzles [4, 46].\\n\\nThere have been a lot of investigations done towards the application of smart irrigation for delivering cheap decision-making solution in an effort to improve its adoption rate [25, 28]. A challenge could be the lack of interdisciplinary approach to fill the gap between machinery and agricultural requirements. A hardware-based system might be cumbersome and expensive to adopt for different crop and soil conditions, whereas a software-based solution can flexibly address this challenge.\\n\\n2 Types of Sensor-Guided Irrigation Systems\\nMany different types of techniques are used for autonomous irrigation systems (e.g., drip, surface, and sprinkler). The percentage of land irrigated by sprinkler, gravity, and drip/trickle systems in the Great Plains is shown in Fig. 12.1. In this section, the different types of irrigation systems are discussed (Fig. 12.2).\\n\\nFig. 12.1\\nfigure 1\\nRatio of different sources (gravity, sprinkler, drip/trickle) used for land irrigation in great plains [15]\\n\\nFull size image\\nFig. 12.2\\nfigure 2\\nOrganization of the chapter\\n\\nFull size image\\n2.1 Center Pivot System\\nInfrastructure is required for field management practices such as center pivot irrigation system. This system needs more advanced communication capabilities to be able to communicate and control the center pivot using IOUT soil moisture measurements. A list of required features in a center pivot system for autonomous irrigation is given below [65]:\\n\\nThe center pivot location/angle can be graphically viewed online.\\n\\nThe pivot can be remotely controlled online for speed, irrigation application rate, etc.\\n\\nOperational information and data can be viewed and stored.\\n\\nPivot point operating water pressure can be monitored.\\n\\nOperating direction of the pivot can be changed.\\n\\nAS/RS status can be monitored.\\n\\nEnd gun operations, including the water application rates, can be controlled.\\n\\nThe system can be run “dry” or “wet.”\\n\\nText alerts can be sent if any operational or safety issues are encountered.\\n\\nIn addition to the remote control and operation hardware and software, the center pivot nozzle sprinkler nozzles should support variable water application capabilities as well as support to enhance the uniformity of the water application. The variable rate center pivot and all of the hardware and software components as well as all agronomic and soil management practices lead to an efficient design of autonomous irrigation system [36, 44].\\n\\n2.2 Drip Irrigation System\\nDrip irrigation system (DIS) is a water system which uses low pressure to water small lawns and gardens using different methods. It differs from other irrigation methods in that it uses less amount of water to keep the roots moist instead of soaking it. The drip system can be hidden under the mulch with water spraying part above the mulch or kept above the soil or mulch with plants hiding it as their size increases with the growth. As discussed above it gives an advantage of using less water as compared to the other counterpart options such as UG sprinkler systems and lawn sprinklers. Moreover, customized water can be applied using drip irrigation system by restricting watering in some areas and allowing in others.\\n\\nFollowing are some advantages of drip irrigation system:\\n\\n1.\\nConserves water by preventing over-spraying, hence, reducing evaporation and environmental effect.\\n\\n2.\\nIt can directly connect to the hose spigot with having to do cuts in home water supplies.\\n\\n3.\\nIt can be placed underground eliminating the need of trenches.\\n\\n4.\\nIt provides customization for water spray control and container in which it can be placed.\\n\\n5.\\nIt prevents over moistening which, otherwise, can cause fungal diseases.\\n\\nComponents of Drip Irrigation System\\nWhile creating a DIS yourself, make sure to buy all components from the same manufacturer. Soaker hoses is a simplest DIS with small holes allowing water to come out. However, this cost-efficient solution uses more water than a normal DIS. Another alternative to create a DIS is using an entire system kit to create a customized DIS. KIT integrates the components to create DIS for specific applications, e.g., for flowerbeds, vegetable gardens, landscape plants (shrubs and trees), and container plants. These kits can also be extended as per the need of the user. Various components of DIS are given below:\\n\\nBackflow preventers—Also known as anti-siphon devices, do not allow the DIS water to go back to water supply so that drinking water is not contaminated while system is switched off.\\n\\nPressure regulator—Balances the pressure between the home water supply and DIS; otherwise, the water pressure of home supply is much greater than the water pressure at DIS.\\n\\nFilters—are used to prevent clogging in the tube caused by the debris.\\n\\nFittings—are used to connect all the system components together.\\n\\nStakes—are used to secure all the system components together.\\n\\nRisers—are used to bring the water emitters to the top, i.e., at the level of plants.\\n\\nTimers—are used to prevent overwatering by setting the time to automatically switch DIS on or off. It can also be controlled via smartphone or computers by connecting it with the home automation system.\\n\\nHole punches— are used to create the holes in the tube which is connecting emitters. Plugs can be used to stop holes punched by mistake.\\n\\nEmitters—Emitters are connected with the tubing system and it emits water through tubes. Its flow rate is given by gallons-per-hour (GPH) and it depends on the type of soil and plant being watered. Every emitter has maximum water pressure mentioned in pounds per square inch (PSI).\\n\\n3 Development Challenges\\nThe challenges which were addressed while developing the system are [65]:\\n\\nDeployment of a field network capable of measuring the soil moisture levels, temperature, and radio communication metrics. The desired network must be low-maintenance, be durable in all-weather condition, and not affect other farm activities.\\n\\nCharacterization of the underground/aboveground wireless channel to determine communication reliability. Communication and channel characteristics are quantified by using different metrics, e.g., coverage distance and received signal strength indicator [31, 60].\\n\\nBack-end software development for data management and visualization. WUSN networks produce glut of important data. All this data must be dynamically received and stored on a cloud application online (via GPRS/3G/4G link) and offline mode (locally). A cloud application can be used for monitoring, e.g., sensor nodes communication, and visualizing, e.g., real-time the power status, purposes. Furthermore, visualization can also be used to locate disconnected sensor nodes, for visualizing historical readings such as soil moisture readings, radio packets location, last reported pivot angle, timestamp, and signal strength of packet received from each underground node [12, 63].\\n\\nUsage of test software to interact with commercial irrigation solutions. Some studies are done on irrigation system controllers; however, most commercial deployments use industrial solutions. These solutions come with a proprietary cloud-based control system with no facility of customized programs development using APIs. The control systems are programmed using a test software [26, 50, 52].\\n\\n4 Irrigation System Components\\nAn advanced CP irrigation system can be used to study the long-term effects of water stres s and yield relationships, variable rate irrigation and fertigation , crop water and nutrient uptak e, develop crop production functions, and other related issues. These studies can be done under full and limited rainfed and irrigation settings [10, 11]. Figure 12.3 shows the overview of irrigation control system [20]. The GPS unit at the end tower in the center pivot can be used to control various irrigation and other operational aspects in addition to these state-of-the-art features in control units of the center pivot. The characteristics of a typical center pivot, where 45% of land is under the outer two spans while 2% is under the first span are shown in Fig. 12.4. The components of irrigation system are described in the upcoming section:\\n\\nFig. 12.3\\nfigure 3\\nThe control system diagram\\n\\nFull size image\\nFig. 12.4\\nfigure 4\\nA typical center pivot [15]\\n\\nFull size image\\n4.1 Sensing and Communication Nodes\\nSensors are used to get the real information from the field. This information can be taken using in-situ sensors, i.e., inside the field, or using remote sensors. The real information of the field can be lost, if inaccurate equipment are used. Most sensing systems are used for sensing soil parameters; however, spectral imaging can also be used to detect plant stress [17, 54]. The sensed data, if not sent immediately to the cloud, can be stored locally for later retrieval. In the absence of direct link with the controller, an optional gateway is used.\\n\\n4.1.1 Subsurface Nodes\\nThe subsurface node is an embedded cyber-physical hardware for sensing and communication between different low-powered low-frequencies sensors and radios. The subsurface nodes use underground antennas for communications [29, 62]. Soil sensors along with dataloggers are also connected to these modes. The information from datalogger act as the basis for calibration of soil sensors. The subsurface nodes can be buried at different depth in soil and should also support connections with soil sensors at different depths generally up to 4 feet [32, 46]. Accordingly, these observations can be used for better deployment of advanced irrigation systems. The subsurface node deployment should be done considering the impact of crop growth and density should be taken into account in the field terrain. Some of the nodes should be used in the field as a reference point for measurement calibrations and for comparison of sensor readings.\\n\\nFor irrigation applications, different types of subsurface nodes can be selected (e.g., off-the-shelf and customized) to speed up the development process and achieve communication between devices, respectively. These nodes and platform should include efficient and high-speed processors, I/O ports, on-board flash storage, and serial ports. These are some of the important parameters to be considered while subsurface node development because they are used to connect with the microcontrollers and GPS modules which communicate with underground nodes [27, 34, 38, 43].\\n\\nTo provide soil moisture calibration data to the IOUT, the soil moisture sensors, temperature sensors, and electrical conductivity sensors can be installed in the center location of different grids (see Fig. 12.4) that can be created in the center pivot field in spatial and temporal domains that measure soil moisture, soil temperature, and electrical conductivity on an hourly basis throughout the growing year. External batteries are the power source of subsurface node that can be complemented by intelligent uninterrupted power supply (UPS) [19] to control the power management and also to report the status of power. A step-down voltage converter can be utilized to meet the 5 V power requirement of nodes [31, 54]. Furthermore, during daytime, power can be provided by solar panels that can also recharge lithium-ion polymer batteries for night usage when solar energy is not available [65].\\n\\nIn addition to system upgrades, a prototype enclosure (Fig. 12.5) is required to make the nodes fully underground, where connectors can be used for software updates along with battery connections for easy aboveground access. The enclosure can host these connectors underground, with easy access through a structure close to the surface. Accordingly, this new enclosure should be tested during the harvesting period for accuracy and durability.\\n\\nFig. 12.5\\nfigure 5\\n(a) Underground node placement layout [15]. (b) A prototype of an underground node, [61]\\n\\nFull size image\\nDue to high signal attenuation in the soil, the low operation frequency and low-power transceivers are preferred in underground communication such as WizziMote developed by WizziLab [64]. WizziMote combines a Texas Instruments CC430F513 16-bit ultra-low-power microcontroller unit with four analog to digital input/output pins, a CC1101 low-power sub-1 GHz RF transceiver, eight configurable GPIOs, and female SMA antenna connector. The microcontroller unit comes with a flash memory of 32 KB and a 12-bit analog to digital converter (ADC). It consumes, at its maximum capacity, 3.2 mA; however, it has various power saving feature which, if enabled, can tailor down the consumption to 1.0 micro Ampere. WizzMote works with 433 MHz applications and reports the transceiver sensitivity of −\\u2009116 dBm at 0.6 kBaud with a 1% packet error rate, at this frequency [28, 37, 65].\\n\\nThe protection of subsurface nodes is an important issue. The waterproof subsurface nodes are very important for efficient underground operation [23, 42] and can be achieved by using waterproof enclosures. These enclosures come with an automatic equalization valve that helps to balance the internal pressure and avoid water condensation [65]. It should also provide ease of access through a soil structure close to the surface. This enclosure should also be able to handle the weight of the farm machinery that is used in harvesting season for collecting crop [33, 35]. The electronic equipment can be protected by the PVC enclosures but it has the risks of being damaged by the leaks in connectors.\\n\\n4.1.2 OTA Nodes\\nThe OTA nodes are designed to study and validate the impact of irrigation system in the real-time. Therefore, data is collected using opposite-facing directional antennas before and after the completion of irrigation. The improved communications in CP help in studying changes in soil moisture. Similarly, customized solution is developed by updating on-board models for irrigation systems, in real-time, to reach soil moisture level [41, 45]. A modem [21] is used to send data from OTA node to server using a wireless mobile communication network. A USB dongle can operate at different cellular bands depending upon the availability of services from telecom service providers . A voltage datalogger can be used to register the battery voltage over time in order to record data for battery replacement needs. The duty cycling in underground nodes is important to conserve energy. This can be achieved by disabling ports. Moreover, the power can be disconnected and restored after some optimal duration to duty cycle the device in the absence of pivot rotation. The communication between devices can allow transmitting the additional data together, which can be implemented in the control. In addition, modifications to the voltage regulation circuit for sampling allow placing a regulator between the battery and embedded system , which can solve the problems arising due to the fluctuations in the reference voltage .\\n\\nMany GPS modules are available with the ability to track multitude of satellites on different channels [2]. These are used for localization in this system. The module selected should be equipped with high sensitivity receiver, built-in datalogger, radiofrequency connector for an external active antenna, and internal patch antenna for efficient power performance. Moreover, the high performance antenna with thread mount and waterproof capabilities is desirable [9].\\n\\nThe aboveground nodes are also used in the system for retrieving sensing data, monitoring the power consumption and battery capacity . These nodes enable the power management thread to gather power consumption information from the battery charging board. This component also enhances the system performance through design of a watchdog system and provides better control of the power system. Moreover, the antennas can be deployed with a better polarization angle in the deployments to enhance connectivity [49, 55]. Figure 12.6 shows the aboveground components. The multi-element directional antennas [58] can be employed for OTA nodes with support for a wide range of operational frequency in MHz and GHz bands. The antennas should support high power and gain with a front to back ratio greater than 20 dB. Generally, lightweight antennas are preferable for these applications.\\n\\nFig. 12.6\\nfigure 6\\nExperiments for AG2UG and UG2AG communication: (a) Antenna placed in non-obstructed direction of AG device, (b) UG2UG experimental aspects which cannot be used for AG experiments, and (c) AG nodes grid [57]\\n\\nFull size image\\n4.2 Software, Flow Rate, and System Capacity\\n4.2.1 Software System\\nThe software are needed in terms of both functionality and to control state-of-the-art system architectures. The individual pieces of software that needed to be maintained separately can run on a single platform. Accordingly, a visualization system can be developed to display information in real-time. The database can be hosted in a server with more resources ensuring that multiple connection requests can be handled properly. As part of the system, an adaptive control system can be developed to support wireless underground sensor-aided irrigation control.\\n\\n4.2.2 System Capacity\\nIn addition to the software system components, a real-time capacity and flow rate system based on this framework can be developed. A definition of the system capacity is provided in Fig. 12.7. Accordingly, soil moisture, location of the center pivot, and wireless communication quality information can be displayed in real-time as data is received. A group of underground nodes can provide individual sensor status that is very useful to detect shorted or disconnected sensors. A gauge can be utilized to display the OTA battery voltage. Similarly, a map of the underground nodes can show the location of the irrigation pivot and the trail of the recent radio packages received by each subsurface node.\\n\\nFig. 12.7\\nfigure 7\\nDefinition of system capacity for a field [15]\\n\\nFull size image\\n4.3 Data Collection\\nThe data collection from the field is important in all seasons particularly in the growing season and winter season. Its significance becomes even higher during farming operations that include cultivation, spraying, planting, determining the amount of irrigation and fertilizer applications, irrigation and fertigation management, harvesting, herbicide, insecticide, pesticide, and fungicide applications , and other soil and plant management practices [30, 42, 51, 60]. This section discusses the message exchange among UG nodes, the AG nodes, and the server.\\n\\nTo enable an out-of-the-box operation, WizziLab provides a Software Development Kit (SDK). This SDK comes with a sample code and environmental installation procedures. A quick 433 MHz solution can be developed using the wireless communication module of SDK; however, no modification can be made to it as it comes as a library. This limits the development of advanced programs for WizziMote because of a bug which, upon hardware interrupt, disables the radio [39, 48]. SDK handles the radio operation and development is done by application, which is the payload of the packets transmitted. The system mainly can use different packets for communications. The AG node sends a packet to request soil moisture from UG nodes. For soil moisture data collection, different sampling periods of soil moisture can be used. UG nodes store these readings with timestamp in device’s flash memory. Accordingly, the AG node uses a cellular link to connect and query the status irrigation system from the cloud [40].\\n\\n5 Management System\\nTable 12.1 shows the monitoring, control, communication, and data reporting capabilities of center pivot control panels for irrigation and water management research infrastructures. The loud-based and mobile applications are used in many commercial irrigation system for control and monitoring of the system [59]. The programming of irrigation system is done by using a very simple panel having couple of buttons. These buttons are enough to implement all options such as increasing/decreasing of value and accept/cancel an action. The cloud-based applications add more flexibility for the manipulation of irrigation system, e.g., scheduling events to occur at certain time. One such event may include start/stop the CP at certain time to synchronize the real-time clock. The cloud system provides interactive graphical interface with all command options appearing on single screen.\\n\\nTable 12.1 Different panels of center pivot control [13]\\nFull size table\\nMoreover, the IOUT can collect the soil information from the system using a mobile sink. The sink can be attached on the top of the controller tower where two opposite-facing antennas for receiving data from the nodes at different distances can be employed using solar panel as an energy source. Accordingly, the subsurface devices installed in the field can measure soil moisture and temperature from different types of soil sensors buried at different depths. The nodes can employ batteries as a power source. The sink nodes then collect the spatio-temporal information from the subsurface nodes and send it over to cloud using OTA communication which further interacts with the CP controller to automate irrigation control [26, 47, 49, 55]. A data analysis flow chart is shown in Fig. 12.8.\\n\\nFig. 12.8\\nfigure 8\\nData analysis flow chart [6]\\n\\nFull size image\\n5.1 Control and Actuation Nodes\\nStudies such as [3, 7, 14, 18, 30] use actuator as a microcontroller attached to an on/off valve. This valve is used to control the water flow of an irrigation system and is similar to a drip [5, 22, 56] and [14]. The works [3, 40, 43, 53] provide a comprehensive design of an actuator interacting with whole system using a communication protocol. The water flow is regulated by the solenoid valves and power to valve is manipulated by latching circuit which takes signals from microcontroller I/O pins. This latching circuit makes the system power efficient by applying short pulses instead of using continuous signals to control the system. The pressure available to a sprinkler along pivot lateral is shown in Fig. 12.9.\\n\\nFig. 12.9\\nfigure 9\\n(a) Pressure loss because of pipe friction due to flow of water [15]. (b) Sprinkler pressure dependent upon pressure loss occurring due to friction, varying elevation fields, and pivot inlet pressure\\n\\nFull size image\\n5.2 Commercial and Cloud Nodes\\nAs in the case of actuator, controllers are also application specific and multiple parameters must be considered while designing controllers. There can be in-situ, remote, or cloud-based controller; standalone or shared with other task; hardware could be a cost-efficient microcontroller or an expensive full-fledged computer system. An in-situ controller can also act as gateway which makes irrigation decision after receiving and processing information. These works [14, 35] suggest a use of real-time operating systems so that execution of all instructions can be ensured.\\n\\nIn [56], a WSN is implemented for application of peach trees monitoring and achieves 72% reduced water consumption. The controller takes decision based on weather and precipitation probability data taken from cloud. If any of the three deployed sensors values goes below the lower threshold, the system starts watering the tree. Due to deep deployment, the upper threshold overshot which, otherwise, would have added significant value to savings. In [14], the authors have used hydrological model to determine exact amount of water to apply. The value for average correlation coefficient of the model estimation and field measurements is 0.9331. For both studies, a valve was used as an actuator to control the water flow from irrigation system. Gutiérrez et al. [8] and Salam [41] recommend to consult farmers for marking threshold values for the irrigation system. In addition to soil moisture value, they also measured soil temperature and started the irrigation every time the threshold of soil moisture and temperature was crossed.\\n\\nThere are no commercial controllers with specific features. This fact motivated [7, 38] towards designing a Wi-Fi re-programmable precision irrigation control system. It is powered by solar radiations and uses the threshold approach as given in [36, 56]. The commercial irrigation system mostly comes with a proprietary control and modification can end up in losing warranty or service term; however, they come with a cloud-based or graphical interface controls and can be extended by writing macro-like scripts for inclusion of data from other sources. Major applications of microcontroller agriculture are to sense crop and soil properties. It reduces the role of humans by remotely collecting the data using wireless transceivers. The system can be customized to one’s need by using different communication technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, and Wi-Fi and too without losing long range and power-efficiency. However, it would be difficult to combine solutions from different vendors because there is no standard protocol [1, 39].\\n\\nThe difference between the prototype and commercial irrigation control system is that the former can be customized for water flow control [22, 24, 36]. There is very limited space of customizing control in commercial systems and due to warranty restrictions internal circuitry cannot be manipulated. The commercial systems come with the support of cloud-based interface and/or mobile applications for sending operational commands and visualizing status of the field. Figure 12.10 shows the system architecture.\\n\\nFig. 12.10\\nfigure 10\\nThe variable rate irrigation [16]\\n\\nFull size image\\nThe cloud-based controllers have their own limitations which must be addressed in order to implement a reliable system. A reliable network is the key to reliability of the system because it provides access to Internet. Loading time of the web-page depends upon the load on the network. A re-designed website may warrant rendering of replay commands and redesigning of control interface. It is also important to mention here that using web-page also brings its own challenges, e.g., time out between the commands can add extra time in executing an action. A modular approach can be followed while designing the adaptive control system to effectively address these limitations with major changes to the system.\\n\\n6 Global Positioning System in Decision Agriculture\\nThe decision irrigation relies on accurate location information to control the irrigation system. However relying solely on GPS information can lead to significant errors in precision irrigation applications. While higher-end GPS devices may decrease the errors to some extent, GPS errors should be considered in system design due to the wireless nature of the GPS system and cost considerations. Due to the inherent errors and delays in pivot angle and GPS measurements, a multi-modal design with other sources for system localization should be developed to solve this problem. Alternatives include using image detection to determine the field location.\\n\\n7 Future Research Directions\\nThe freshwater is important resource and it should be preserved in huge amount for a center pivot irrigation system to automatically irrigate based on soil conditions. However, decision from such system is likely to have an adverse effect on crop yield which requires a long-term commitment in order to study in detail. The controller advances should be used to receive information from UG node, buried in the field, and also to accordingly set the irrigation rate. However, there is still need of improvements.\\n\\nAccordingly, such systems should be capable of self-calibrating. To that end, remote soil sensing technologies should be used for the sensors adjustment close to the surface. GPS systems are very important part of control system and GPS interferometric reflectometry is a perfectly viable method. The center pivot movements can be used to calibrate the UG nodes in the vicinity of irrigation system path on the go. The current systems are incapable of employing more sensors and adding software components that reduces the efficiency of embedded system in terms of low-power consumption. Therefore, there are potential areas in which underground nodes can be improved.', 'unique_identifier': 86}\n",

Different methods of irrigation are in use like \\ndrip irrigation, sprinkler irrigation, etc. to tackle with the water \\nwastage problem in traditional methods like flood irrigation and \\nfurrow irrigation[9-13]\\n.\\nProductivity of agricultural fields varies for many reasons. \\nThe variability includes topographic relief, changes in soil texture, \\ntillage and compaction, fertility differences, localized pest \\ndistributions and various irrigation system characteristics[14-18]\\n. \\nThe effects of different sources of variability on management can \\nbe additive and interrelated. In this regard, recent advances in \\ncommunications and microprocessors have led to the general \\nimplementation of site-specific water application systems by \\nself-propelled and linear move sprinkler irrigation systems[19-22]\\n. \\nDesigning of a suitable site-specific irrigation system could be \\ncomplicated and challenging because it needs to address many\\ncauses of the variations existing in each field including the system \\ncapabilities that may be needed in achieving the desired \\nmanagement level, constraints inherent in the currently existing \\nequipment and the general management philosophy of the \\nowner/operator (decision support). These considerations are not \\nmutually exclusive, but they do not lend themselves well to \\ncategorization. These issues are discussed in more detail by \\nseveral researchers[23-27]\\n. McCarthy et al.\\n[28] developed a \\npredictive-adaptive control model for site-specific irrigation water \\napplication of cotton using a center pivot. Various simulation \\nmodels were used to evaluate alternative irrigation control options \\nView metadata, citation and similar papers at core.ac.uk brought to you by CORE\\nprovided by Loughborough University Institutional Repository\\n24 January, 2018 Int J Agric & Biol Eng Open Access at https://www.ijabe.org Vol. 11 No.1\\nacross a range of crop management and environmental conditions. \\nThe authors concluded that while the framework accommodated a \\nrange of system control strategies, further work is necessary to \\nexplore procedures for using data with a range of spatial and time \\nscales.\\nDecision support systems should be holistic approaches to \\ncrop irrigation. Within the decision support program structure, \\nthe irrigator predefines the criteria and guidelines to be used by the \\nsoftware structure and simulation models in making basic decisions \\nto be implemented by a microprocessor-based control system. \\nResults of geo-referenced grid sampling of soils, yield maps and \\nother precision agriculture tools can also be major components in\\ndefining rules for these management systems. These ‘rules’ are \\nused as the basis for analysing and interpreting the data from real \\ntime data networks, remote sensing, irrigation monitoring systems, \\nagronomic and other information used to provide direction and\\nimplement of basic commands[29,30]\\n. Decision support systems \\ncan also include instructions for chemigation (e.g., nitrogen \\nfertilizer) and provide alerts (e.g., insects, diseases) to the grower \\nbased on output from established models using real-time\\nenvironmental data. In short, decision support provides more \\nmanagement flexibility by implementing short term, routine \\ncommands to direct irrigation schedules and other basic operations, \\nwhich frees the irrigator to concentrate on managing other areas to \\nminimize risk and reduce costs[31,32]\\n. \\nVast simulation models or integrated approaches were used to \\nevaluate alternative irrigation management options across a range \\nof crop and environmental conditions[33-35]\\n. These integrated \\napproaches require the integration of various sensor systems (on \\nthe irrigation machine and in the field), hardware, controllers and \\ncomputing power. The maximum benefits will be derived from a \\ndecision support system when the plant condition in selected areas \\nof a field is monitored by some means to improve overall system \\nmanagement. Monitoring systems can be field-based \\nmeasurements or remotely sensed or an integrated mix of several \\nsensor systems[36]\\n.\\nIn this research, the techniques used to gain information \\nabout autonomous sensor irrigation management technologies \\nwill be explained, which includes information collecting using \\nwireless sensor networks, remote sensor connection, data \\nmanagement schemes and target controlling. There are rare \\nreviews on the topic of autonomous sensor irrigation management \\nin the existing literature and this study aims to fill the gap and \\nprovide a more up to date and thorough review, featuring many \\nnew developments in irrigation management and an extension to \\nthe application of latest sensor technology in agricultural \\nengineering. The relationship of the sections of this review \\npaper is as illustrated in Figure 1.\\n2 Remote access and communications \\nThis section mainly focuses on the components used for \\nremotely controlling or monitoring sprinkler irrigation systems \\nthrough computers and accessories. Many of these methods are \\nbeing marketed by the manufacturers of this equipment and include \\ncell phones, RF radios, and satellite radio communications for \\nrelatively basic monitoring and control of the systems. Hybrid \\nsystems relying on internet to connect computers at or near the site \\nare combined with wireless RF systems for the link to the \\nmachine[37,38]\\n. \\nFigure 1 Relationship of autonomous sensor irrigation \\nmanagement technologies\\nEach manufacturer has developed unique hardware and \\nsoftware that allow the owner to access the main control panel to \\ndetermine system status including travel direction, application \\ndepth, and field position. More sophisticated software provided \\nby an office base station uses visualization software to allow the \\nowner to see year-to-date summaries of water and chemical \\napplication events[39-41]\\n. Shock et al.[42] used radio transmission \\nfor soil moisture data from data loggers to a central computer \\nlogging site.\\nResearchers from the Department of Soil and Crop Science and \\nCivil Engineering at Colorado State University developed WISE \\nfor agricultural producers, irrigation managers, and research \\nscientists[43,44]\\n. The tool resides on a cloud based platform of the \\nenvironmental risk assessment and management system, and uses \\nthe soil water balance (SWB) approach to assist users by providing \\nrecommended irrigation amounts for individual fields. Mandatory \\nsetup of a field can only be completed on a web browser via a \\ncomputer. The difficulty of outlining field shapes on a smart \\nphone or tablet prohibits users from using the full version of WISE \\non those devices; therefore, the mobile version does not possess \\nfull capabilities of WISE. Instead, users can easily view their soil \\nmoisture profile, irrigations, precipitation, and soil deficit values \\nonce the project and field are set up using a web browser on a \\npersonal computer[45-47]\\n. \\nThe GSM based automated irrigation control system with a \\ngun sprinkler[48,49] was mentioned about using automatic \\nmicrocontroller based rain gun irrigation system in which the \\nirrigation will take place only when there will be intense \\nrequirement of water. Mobile phones have almost become an \\nintegral part for serving multiple needs of humans. Mobile phone \\napplications make use of the GPRS feature of mobile phone as a \\nsolution for irrigation control system. These systems cover less\\nrange of agriculture land and not economically affordable. The \\nsystem uses GSM to send message and an android app to notify the \\nfarmer to overcome under irrigation, over irrigation that causes \\nleaching and loss of nutrient content of soil[50,51]\\n. \\nThe GSM based automatic irrigation control system for \\nefficient use of resources and crop planning by using an android \\nmobile phone[52,53] is featured of the water management decision, \\nwhich is used for monitoring the whole system with GSM (RS-232) \\nmodule. The system can continuously monitor the water level \\n(water level sensor) in the tank and provide accurate amount of \\nwater required to the plant or tree (crop). The system checks the \\ntemperature, and humidity of soil to retain the nutrient composition \\nof the soil managed for proper growth of plant. This system is \\nJanuary, 2018 Zhu X Y, et al.

Cell \\nphone systems with modems at the control panels are the least \\ncostly and probably the most common. Satellite radio \\ncommunications are often preferable when there are large \\ntopographic differences that limit cell phone service[56,57]\\n. Higher \\npowered, licensed, radio systems (e.g., 5-10 W) with data modems \\nmay also be an option but may also be affected by topographic \\nrelief. Repeater stations for radio frequency systems can also be \\nquite expensive, especially if there is a need to communicate long \\ndistances over diverse topography. These additions to the existing \\non- board control capabilities of center pivot panels make \\nsite-specific irrigation a reality for irrigation zones less than 100 m2\\n. \\nThe main considerations remaining include the development of \\ndecision support systems that maximize the value of the applied \\nwater or chemical based on field-specific information and the cost \\nrecovery potential of the cropping system since system costs up to \\n$20 000 are possible when there are many management zones \\nalong the system length.\\n3 Distributed wireless sensor networks\\nIn-field sensor-based irrigation systems offer the potential to \\nsupport site-specific irrigation management that allows producers \\nto maximize their productivity while saving water. The seamless \\nintegration of sensors, data interface, software design, and \\ncommunications for site specific irrigation control using wireless \\nsensor-based irrigation systems can also be challenging[58]\\n. \\nElectrical power needs are often a major consideration and solar \\npanels are often used. A number of researchers have addressed \\nthe issues of interfacing sensors and irrigation control using several \\ndifferent approaches. Shock et al.[42] used radio transmission for \\nsoil moisture data from data loggers to a central data logging site \\nwhere decisions were made and manually changed. Wall and \\nKing[59] explored various designs for smart soil moisture sensors \\nand sprinkler valve controllers for implementing ‘plug-and-play’ \\ntechnology, and proposed architectures for distributed sensor \\nnetworks for site specific irrigation automation. They concluded \\nthat the coordination of control and instrumentation data is most \\neffectively managed using data networks and low-cost \\nmicrocontrollers. However, it is often not feasible to have in-field \\nsensing stations that use wires to connect to a base station because \\nof the cost, labour and maintenance, especially if the distances are \\ngreater than 10 m. Wires can also be damaged by farm equipment \\nand small animals; and wires create more opportunity for lightning \\ndamage. In this regard, wireless data communication systems \\navoid many of these problems and provide dynamic mobility and \\neasy relocation and replacement of stations. Radio frequency \\ntechnology has been widely adopted in consumer’s wireless \\ncommunication products and provided opportunities to deploy \\nwireless signal communication in agricultural systems. Adopting \\na standard interface for sensors and actuators allows reuse of \\ncommon hardware and communication protocols such as \\ncommunication interface and control algorithm software. \\nInstrumentation and control standards for RS232 serial (voltage \\nbased) and RS485 (current based) communication protocols have \\nbeen widely applied and well documented for integrating sensors \\nand actuators, particularly in industrial applications. Two wireless \\nprotocols that are commonly used for this purpose are Bluetooth \\n(802.15.1) (IEEE Std. 802.15.1, 2005) and ZigBee (802.15.4) \\n(IEEE Std. 802.15.4a, 2007). Bluetooth and ZigBee (IEEE \\n802.11 standards) are designed for radio-frequency (RF) \\napplications for mobile applications that require a relatively low \\ndata rate, long battery life, and good network security[60-63]\\n.\\nThese are ‘line-of-sight’ (LOS) systems and crop canopies, \\nsmall trees, and fences can interfere with transmissions. ZigBee is \\na low-cost, non-proprietary wireless mesh networking standard, \\nwhich allows longer life with smaller batteries, and the \\ndirect-sequence spread spectrum (DS/SS) mesh networking \\nprovides high reliability. Bluetooth is a faster but more expensive \\nstandard than ZigBee, and uses spread spectrum modulation \\ntechnology called frequency hopping (FH/SS) to avoid interference \\nand ensure data integrity. ZigBee has lower power needs than \\nBluetooth, but it also transmits effectively over less distance (e.g., \\n30 m). Enhanced Bluetooth transmitters are available that can \\ntransmit up to 1 km. Bluetooth wireless technology has been \\nadapted in sensing and control of agricultural systems[64,65]\\n. \\nZhang[66] evaluated Bluetooth radio in different agricultural \\nenvironments, power consumption levels, and data transmission \\nrates. He observed 1.4 m as an optimal radio height for maximum \\n44 m radio range and reported limitations of significant signal loss \\nafter 8 h continuous battery operation and 2-3 s of transmission \\nlatency with the increase of communication range. Oksanen et \\nal.[67] used a PDA with Bluetooth to connect a GPS receiver for \\ntheir open, generic and configurable automation platform for \\nagricultural machinery. Lee et al.[68] explored an application of \\nBluetooth wireless data transportation of moisture concentration of \\nharvested silage and reported a limitation of 10 m short range. \\nHowever, the limitations reported by reviewed publications about \\nBluetooth applications in agricultural systems can be solved or \\nminimized by system design optimization. The power shortage \\ncan be solved by using solar power that recharges the battery. \\nThe radio range and transmission latency can also be extensively \\nimproved by using an upgraded power class and antenna. The \\nsame techniques can be applied to Zigbee-based systems.\\nDrawbacks in using wireless sensors and wireless sensor \\nnetworks include provision for ample bandwidth, existing \\ninefficiencies in routing protocols, electromagnetic interference, \\ninterference by vegetation, radio range, sensor battery life, and \\nsynchronous data collection[69]\\n. An immediate limiting factor in \\nself-powered WSN operations is battery life, which can be \\naddressed to some degree by decreasing the duty cycle of the \\nsensor nodes. Researchers are also concentrating on RF \\ncommunication protocols to increase the energy efficiency of a \\nWSN by investigating algorithms for multi-path routing, data \\nthroughput and energy consumption, and by reducing idle listening \\nand collisions that occur during the medium access to realize power \\nconservation[70,71]\\n. \\nHowever, reducing quiescent current draw is typically a \\nsignificant method for impacting battery longevity[72]\\n. Other \\nidentified challenges specific to WSNs and agriculture include \\ninterference with radio propagation due to crop canopy height[73]\\n. \\nAndrade-Sanchez et al.[74] determined that power consumption and \\n26 January, 2018 Int J Agric & Biol Eng Open Access at https://www.ijabe.org Vol. 11 No.1\\npower output varied significantly among transceivers, and the \\naverage measure of signal strength as a function of distance \\nresembled the shape of the theoretical prediction of path loss in free \\nspace. In addition, the received signal strength indication (RSSI) \\nwas influenced by the spatial arrangement of the network in both \\nthe vertical and horizontal planes in tests with line-of-sight. \\nSignal obstruction issues relating to crop height and in-field \\nequipment are inherently reduced when the moving sprinkler is \\nused as the sensor platform; but infield sensors require manual \\nadjustment above crop canopy.\\nTable 2 summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of \\ndistributed wireless sensor networks (WSN).\\nTable 2 Advantages and disadvantages of distributed wireless \\nsensor networks (WSN)\\nAdvantages Disadvantages\\nAllows producers to maximize \\ntheir productivity while saving \\nwater\\nPower needs are \\noften a major \\nconsideration\\nInterference by \\nvegetation\\nProvide dynamic mobility and \\neasy relocation and \\nreplacement of stations\\nProvision for ample \\nbandwidth\\nSynchronous data \\ncollection\\nCoordination of control and \\ninstrumentation data is most \\neffectively\\nExisting \\ninefficiencies in \\nrouting protocols\\nSensor battery life\\nRadio range\\nManaged using data networks \\nand low-cost microcontrollers\\nElectromagnetic \\ninterference\\nInterference with radio \\npropagation to crop \\ncanopy height\\n4 Sensors and integrated data management schemes\\nIn this section, to determine the soil moisture content either in \\nvolumetric and gravimetric forms, various techniques can be \\nemployed, which can be categorized. These are classical and \\nmodern techniques for both the laboratory and in situ \\nmeasurements. The classical soil moisture measurement \\ntechniques include thermo-gravimetric, calcium carbide neutron \\nscattering, gypsum block and tensiometer methods[75-77]\\n. While \\nthe modern techniques utilize soil resistivity sensor, tensiometer, \\ninfrared moisture balance and dielectric techniques like Time \\nDomain Reflectometry (TDR), Frequency Domain Reflectometry \\n(FDR) capacitance technique, heat flux soil moisture sensors, \\nmicro-electro mechanical systems and optical techniques[78,79]\\n. \\nEstimation of water content based on sensor measurements \\nprovides real time, in situ measurements at a relatively affordable \\ncost. Soil moisture sensors potentially provide the means to \\nirrigate in accordance with the unique characteristics of a given \\ncrop in a given field. These sensors can be used as a ‘stand-alone’ \\nmethod, or their use can be combined with the FAO method, or \\nthey can be used to complement irrigation management based on \\nexperience[80]\\n. \\nAutomating farm or nursery irrigation systems allows farmers \\nto apply the right amount of water at the right time, regardless of \\nthe availability of labor to turn valves on and off. It only allows \\nthe user to monitor and maintain the moisture level remotely \\nirrespective of time. If the plants get water at the proper time then \\nit helps to increase the production from 25% to 30%[81,82]\\n. \\nTraditional instrumentation based on discrete and wired solutions, \\npresents many difficulties on measuring and control systems \\nespecially over the large geographical areas. If different kinds of \\nsensors (that is, temperature, humidity, etc.) are involved in such \\nirrigation in future works, it can be said that an internet based \\nremote control of irrigation automation will be possible. The \\ndeveloped system can also transfer fertilizer and the other \\nagricultural chemicals (calcium, sodium, ammonium, zinc) to the \\nfield with adding new sensors and valves. Cost effective solar \\npower can be the answer for all our energy needs. Conserves \\nelectricity by reducing the usage of grid power and conserves water \\nby reducing water losses[83,84]\\n.\\nA conceptual system layout of distributed in-field wireless \\nsensor network (WSN) is illustrated in Figure 2[85]\\n. Farmers can \\nget the real-time information of their farmland by android app or \\nthrough automatic SMS facility, for better crop management \\npractices. Using this information, the farmers could be advised \\nthat when and how much to irrigate. \\nFigure 2 Application of sensor network in field\\nThe system comprises of several components called ‘nodes’. \\nThese are smart devices that are used to collect the application \\noriented data requirements. A sensor network performs three \\nbasic functions that is Sensing, Communication and Computation \\nby using hardware, software and algorithm[86]\\n. The nodes perform \\nseveral roles and the distributed nodes that collect the information \\nare called source node while the node that gathers the information \\nfrom all source node is called the sink node or the gateway node. \\nThe sink node has high computing power. A source node also \\nworks as a routing node due to the requirement of multi hop \\nrouting. External memory is an optional module that could be \\nneeded in case of data storage requirement for local decision \\nmaking. The in-field sensors monitor the field conditions of soil \\nmoisture, soil temperature, and air temperature. All in-field \\nsensory data are wirelessly transmitted to the base station. The \\nbase station processes the in-field sensory data through a \\nuser-friendly decision-making program and sends control \\ncommands to the irrigation control station[87]\\n.\\nDias et al.[88] developed a new single probe heat pulse sensor \\n(SPHP), which was comprised of only one element, a n-p-n \\njunction bipolar transistor, worked as both heating and temperature \\nsensing elements. Xiao et al.[89] developed a wireless, integrated, \\nfrequency domain soil moisture sensor for paddy field (WFDSS) \\napplications in China. This soil sensor was able to measure soil \\nmoisture content and water depth at the same time and transmitted \\nthe collected data wirelessly to a remote data management center. \\n5 Sprinkler control options\\nCenter pivot systems, for example, operate on varying \\ntopography and often have a range in soil textures present under a \\nsingle machine. Each of these factors represents a reason for \\nusing some sort of monitor/controller to manage water applications \\nbased upon need. Precision application, variable rate irrigation \\nand site-specific irrigation are terms developed to describe water \\nJanuary, 2018 Zhu X Y, et al. Review of intelligent sprinkler irrigation technologies for remote autonomous system Vol. 11 No.1 27\\napplication devices with the goal of maximizing the economic \\nand/or environmental value of the water applied via a moving \\nirrigation system[90-92]\\n. The most basic method to alter the water \\ndepth applied with a center pivot is to adjust the center pivot speed \\nof travel based upon field soils or more frequently based upon field \\ntopographic features or different crops. Early developments \\nprovided a very limited set of controls to turn end guns on/off \\nbased upon field position. Other features included edge of field \\nstops and stop-in-slot controls to cease irrigation due to \\nobstructions or the completion of a complete rotation[93-96]\\n. \\nProgrammable control panels allow adjusting the speed of \\ntravel multiple times during an irrigation event. This is \\naccomplished by entering the field position in a 360o\\ncircle where \\nthe speed will be changed to apply more, less or no irrigation water. \\nThis approach could be used where portions of the field were \\nplanted with a different crop, but it lacked the flexibility necessary \\nto supply water at rates required to meet management objectives of \\nrelatively small field areas with irregular shaped boundaries[97-99]\\n. \\nThe individual sprinkler control of water application depth can \\nbe accomplished by using a series of on-off time cycles or as it has \\nbecome known as ‘pulsing’ the sprinkler through on-off \\ncycles[100,101]\\n. Reducing the on-time is effective at reducing both \\nthe application depth and the water application rate. Later efforts \\nin Washington State involved equipping a center pivot with a \\ncustom built electronic controller to activate water operated \\nsolenoid valves in groups of 2-4 nozzles[102-104]\\n. Normally open \\nsolenoids allowed system control with the assurance that irrigation \\nwater was applied even if the control system failed. Chávez et \\nal.[105,106] reported that a remote irrigation monitoring and control \\nsystem installed on two different linear move irrigation systems \\nperformed well. The systems proved to be highly flexible and \\ncapable of precision irrigation using a series of in-field and \\non-board wireless monitoring spread spectrum radios/sensors \\nnetworks. Individual nozzle/solenoid valves were pulsed \\naccording to prescription maps. Deviations related to positioning \\nof nozzles when irrigating were on average (2.5±1.5) m due mainly \\nto inherent DGPS inaccuracy. A variable flow sprinkler was \\ndeveloped for controlling irrigation water application by King and \\nKincaid[107] and Liu et al.[108] The variable flow sprinkler uses a \\nmechanically-activated pin to alter the nozzle orifice area which \\nadjusted the sprinkler flow rate over the range of 35% to 100% of \\nits rated flow rate based upon operating pressure. The pin was \\ncontrolled using either electric or hydraulic actuators. The main \\nissue is that the wetted pattern and water droplet size distribution of \\nthe sprinkler changed with flow rate which created water \\napplication uniformity issues due to a change in sprinkler pattern \\noverlap[109,110]\\n. Controlling irrigation water application depth can \\nalso be accomplished using multiple manifolds with different sized \\nsprinkler nozzles to vary water and nitrogen application[111-113]\\n. \\nThese systems included 2-3 manifolds where simultaneous \\nactivation of one or manifolds served to adjust the water \\napplication rate and depth across a range of depths that is not \\npossible with a single sprinkler package. Control of each \\nmanifold was accomplished using solenoid valves like those \\ndescribed for the pulsing sprinkler option above. As with any \\nnew technology, there are positives and negatives associated with \\neach of these methods of controlling sprinkler flow rates. \\nCertainly, long term maintenance by producers is an issue. \\nHowever, the most important factor limiting their use is their \\ninstallation cost that ranges from around $2000 for a system \\nmonitor to over $20 000 for control of individual sprinklers.\\n6 Conclusions and future work\\nElectronic sensors, equipment controls, and communication \\nprotocols have been developed to meet the growing interest in \\nsite-specific irrigation systems. On-board and field-distributed \\nsensors can collect data necessary for real-time irrigation \\nmanagement decisions and transmit the information through \\nwireless networks to the main control panel or base computer. \\nEquipment controls necessary to alter water application depth to \\nmeet the management criteria for relatively small management zones\\nare now commercially available from irrigation system manufacturers\\nand after-market suppliers. But decision systems for automatic \\ncontrol are incomplete. Selection of the communications system \\nfor remote access depends on local and regional topography and \\ncost relative to other methods. Communication systems such as \\ncell phones, satellite radios, and internet based systems allow the \\noperator to query the main control panel or base computer from any \\nlocation at any time. Recent developments in the center pivot \\nindustry have led to contractual relationships between after-market \\nsuppliers and irrigation system manufacturers that should support \\nfurther development of site-specific application of water, nutrients \\nand pesticides in the future. \\nHowever, the limitations reported in reviewed publications \\nabout Bluetooth applications in agricultural systems can be solved \\nor alleviated by system design optimization. The power shortage \\ncan be solved by using solar power that recharges the battery. \\nThe radio range and transmission latency can also be extensively \\nimproved by using an upgraded power class and antenna. The \\nsame techniques can be applied to Zigbee-based systems. \\nConsidering a real need to improve the efficiency of irrigation \\nsystems and prevent the non-optimal use', 'unique_identifier': 87}\n",

In this paper, a case study was conducted on cotton production. Soil moisture sensors were set at depths of 10–110\\u202fcm under three cotton cropping systems (monoculture cotton (MC), wheat/delayed intercropped cotton (WIC), and wheat/direct-seeded cotton (WDC)) based on spatial grid methods; a geostatistical grid calculus was used to calculate SWM; and the crop and meteorological influence mechanisms on cotton lint yield were comprehensively analyzed. At the squaring stage, SWC and vertical SWM were significantly correlated with light, temperature and water conditions. At the flowering and boll development stage, SWC and vertical SWM were collectively affected by meteorological conditions and crops, and they were positively correlated with lint yield. The aboveground and belowground biomass accumulation at the flowering and boll development stage positively affected vertical SWM in and between cotton rows. Vertical SWM in cotton rows increased SWC in cotton rows. SWC in cotton rows and aboveground biomass positively impacted lint yield formation; SWC between rows negatively impacted lint yield. The SWC and vertical SWM between rows in the MC seedling stage exceeded those in cotton rows, and more precise irrigation at the seedling stage reduced water waste. The WIC horizontal SWC at the squaring and flowering and boll opening stages was relatively high, moving from the row midline to cotton row. A better SWC distribution in and between cotton rows promoted water utilization in the cotton rows; this method was feasible for improving cotton yield in diverse planting systems. The results could optimize precision irrigation management at different cotton growth stages and provide a theoretical reference for promoting sustainable agricultural production and climate adaptation.\\n\\nGraphical Abstract\\n\\nDownload : Download high-res image (232KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\n\\nPrevious article in issueNext article in issue\\nKeywords\\nCottonYieldSoil water movementSoil water consumptionPlanting system\\n1. Introduction\\nFreshwater is widely regarded as an important natural resource and has become a globally scarce and overexploited resource (Bartram, 2008, Falkenmark, 2008). Agricultural activities are important methods for consuming freshwater resources worldwide. With climate change becoming increasingly serious, the frequent occurrence of high temperatures and drought seriously affects agricultural water security, thus impacting regional agricultural production (IPCC, 2014). The climate sensitivity of agriculture is affected by technological changes (Ortiz-Bobea et al., 2018). While narrowing the gap in crop yield (Mueller et al., 2012), sustainable agricultural water management technology has become increasingly important for reducing water waste, promoting agricultural adaptation and ensuring food security (Zhang et al., 2021b, Howden et al., 2007). In recent years, with the addition of precision agriculture sensor technology, the variability and characteristics of soil moisture have been monitored. On this basis, combined with a decision support system, sustainable precision irrigation technology has been implemented (Zhang et al., 2021a). In precision irrigation technology, monitoring the spatiotemporal changes in soil moisture in the field is highly important (Mertzanides et al., 2020). Previous studies have been conducted from the landscape to the plot scale (Booker et al., 2015, Wu et al., 2023), proving the relationship between soil moisture change and agricultural productivity (Hu et al., 2020, Pabuayon et al., 2019).\\n\\nSoil water movement (SWM) is the cause of spatiotemporal changes in soil water (Liu et al., 2020). In farmland ecosystems, atmosphere–plant–soil interactions form a unity that plays a key role in the field water cycle; water moves within and among the three (Schulze et al., 2019, Jones and Tardieu, 1998). Several studies have shown that diversified crop planting systems and crop residues reduce the runoff of field water (Zougmore et al., 2000, Sissoko et al., 2013). Different crop planting systems adjust the spatiotemporal changes in soil moisture; however, the dynamics of topsoil moisture are strongly affected by meteorological factors, especially rainfall (Wu et al., 2022b). A study on the movement of soil water vapor on the land surface showed that the convective (advective) transport of water vapor may be caused by diurnal warming leading to the expansion and contraction of soil air (Parlange et al., 1998). Soil water runoff characteristics at relatively high depths are comprehensively affected by rainfall, soil texture, crop absorption and shallow soil (Jalota et al., 2006, Hess et al., 2018; Tsakmakisa et al., 2019). Many previous studies on SWM have focused on theoretical models or laboratory studies on soil physics and hydrology, mainly concentrating on the effects of soil physical properties or meteorological conditions (Parlange et al., 1998, Li et al., 2015).\\n\\nModeling methods are used in some studies to consider the impacts of cultivated crops or agricultural measures on SWM, simulating the evapotranspiration of SWM in small areas of vegetation (Paraskevas et al., 2013), the impact of rainfall on water runoff in farming systems (Myers, 1996), and SWM under root water absorption (Wu et al., 1999). Several studies have explored SWM characteristics in different soil layers at the field scale using the spatial grid method combined with the geological grid mathematical operation method with semivariance analysis as the core, revealing that the trapezoidal rule accurately quantifies the movement volume of soil water (Liu et al., 2020). These geostatistical methods have been used for monitoring soil nutrients in the field (Song et al., 2016). Semivariance analysis may calculate structural parameters of semivariogram, such as the nugget (C0), sill (C0+C) and their proportion (C0/C0+C), corresponding to the heterogeneity, maximum variation degree and autocorrelation of changes (Hu and Xu, 2018; Mcbratney and Webster, 1986). The grid calculus method is a geostatistical method that is usually used to calculate slope-related problems. The slope or slope change rate information in the specified direction are obtained through directional derivatives (Tuma et al., 1979). The first-order directional derivative shows the contour with a constant slope along a fixed directional line (Schwartz et al., 1974). At a specific grid node location, if the slope is uphill, the slope is positive; if the slope is downhill, the slope is negative. This geostatistical grid calculus method is used to calculate the SWM and its direction after obtaining the volume or spatial distribution of soil water consumption (SWC) (Pabuayon et al., 2019).\\n\\nCotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is one of the most important industrial crops in the world. Since cotton plants exhibit good drought and temperature resistance (Abdelraheem et al., 2019), they are suitable for use in arid climates and regions (Mao et al., 2019). The Yellow River Basin is one of the three major cotton cultivation regions in China (Huang et al., 2023), where a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)–cotton double cropping system has been developed to alleviate the contradiction between grain and cotton competing for land (Feng et al., 2017). Previous studies have shown that monoculture cotton and cotton intercropped with wheat are considered to have higher yields and resource utilization efficiencies than cotton direct seeding after wheat; this method is a better choice for local people (Wang et al., 2020). The adoption of different cotton planting systems affects the spatiotemporal changes and consumption characteristics of soil water, which may be closely related to the development of roots and reproductive organs (Wu et al., 2022a, Wu et al., 2022b). In addition, the competition for soil water during wheat growth (Mahmood-ul-Hassan et al., 2013) in the wheat–cotton symbiosis period (generally in the period from cotton sowing to seedling emergence) and the influence of crop residues after wheat harvest on water evaporation (Lascano et al., 1994) are important factors that affect the use of water resources by cotton plants. If we extend the understanding of the relationships between SWM and SWC and crop growth and yield under cotton monocropping and wheat–cotton intercropping, this approach could aid in precision irrigation, further improve the water utilization efficiency of crop production in the wheat–cotton double cropping system and ensure crop yield while reducing water waste (Zhang et al., 2017, Tang et al., 2010).\\n\\nThis study is based on the hypothesis that the distribution of spatiotemporal changes in SWM and SWC might be affected by different cotton planting systems; and that cotton lint yield may respond to the SWM and SWC characteristics at different spatial positions in the soil. The objectives of this study are (i) to develop a geostatistical grid calculus method based on a sensor network constructed by the spatial grid method for quantifying the SWM at different soil positions in the field at different cotton growth stages; (ii) to determine the spatial distributions of SWM and SWC in different cotton planting systems and the correlations between SWM, SWC, meteorological conditions and crop growth; and (iii) to explore the factors influencing the SWM and the driving roles of SWM in SWC and the growth and yield formation of cotton crops in different planting systems. In this study, a novel method that combines sensor network and geostatistical grid calculus for quantifying SWM was developed; this method may provide theoretical support for precision agriculture and climate-smart agriculture; additionally, it may have important reference value for clean production and sustainable agricultural development under global climate change conditions.\\n\\n2. Materials and methods\\n2.1. Experimental site\\nA 2-year (2016–2017) field experiment was conducted at an experimental station (N 36°07´, E 116°22´ with an elevation of 76\\u202fm) of the Institute of Cotton Research, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Anyang, Henan, China; this station has a semihumid and subtropical monsoon climate with a mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 544\\u202fmm. The experimental site had medium loam soil. Weather data were acquired from a weather station near the experimental field (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA). The weather conditions regarding rainfall and temperature differed substantially between the two cotton growing seasons (Fig. 1A). During the two-year study, a greater level of precipitation (549\\u202fmm) and a lower mean temperature (23.1°C) were recorded in 2016. The precipitation in 2017 was 351\\u202fmm, and the mean temperature was 23.5°C. The precipitation in these two years was mainly concentrated in July. The precipitation in July 2016 was 310\\u202fmm and that in July 2017 was 106\\u202fmm. On July 19, 2016, there was heavy rainfall; the precipitation was 107.5\\u202fmm. In 2017, the maximum daily precipitation of 46.8\\u202fmm occurred on July 16. During the cotton growing period, the temperature conditions in 2016 were similar to those in 2017.\\n\\nFig. 1\\nDownload : Download high-res image (441KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 1.

Experimental design\\nThe field experiment included three cotton planting systems (monocultured cotton (MC), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/intercropped cotton (WIC), and wheat/direct-seeded cotton (WDC)) and use a randomized complete block design with 3 repetitions (Fig. 1B). The trial cotton cultivar was the early-maturing cultivar Yuzaomian 9110, and the wheat cultivar was Zhongyu 1123. In 2016 and 2017, cotton was sown on May 15 for both MC and WIC; cotton was sown on June 15 for WDC. Wheat was sown on October 26 in 2015 and 2016 and harvested on June 10 in the following year; cotton had an intergrowth period of approximately 30 days in WIC. The layout of the cropping systems is shown in Fig. 1B. The cotton plants were sown at an intrarow spacing of approximately 0.14–0.15\\u2009m at a density of 80,000 plants/ha. The row spacing was 0.7\\u2009m between two cotton rows, 0.2\\u2009m between cotton and wheat rows, and 0.15\\u2009m between two wheat rows. For each of the three wheat rows, one row of cotton was planted. The planting system was an integrated factor (including plant, soil, and environment); the three cotton planting systems were considered three treatments (Ma, 1990). Each experimental individual plot had an area of 31.5\\u2009m2, a length of 9\\u2009m and a width of 3.5\\u2009m. Field management was consistent across the treatments. According to local practices, all fertilizers were broadcasted evenly across the soil and incorporated into the top 20\\u2009cm of the soil before sowing. During the wheat growth period, N:P:K (13:17:15) compound fertilizer was applied as a starter fertilizer to supply 78\\u2009kg\\u2009ha−1 N, 102\\u2009kg\\u2009ha−1 P2O5 and 90\\u2009kg\\u2009ha−1 K2O before wheat sowing; 260\\u2009kg\\u2009ha−1 urea and 150\\u2009kg\\u2009ha−1 compound fertilizer composed of N-P2O5-K2O [17−17−17] were applied during the cotton growing period. Trench irrigation (600\\u2009m3 ha−1) was applied on March 16, 2016, and 2017. According to the suggestions of local agronomists, a total of approximately 40\\u2009m3 irrigation was applied to flood trenches after the cotton plants were planted. Weeds were manually controlled, and pesticides were used to control insects and disease.\\n\\n2.3. Crop data collection\\nThe cotton growth stages were investigated by 20 tagged cotton plants in each plot every three days after cotton emergence. The times when the cotton population entered the squaring (50% of cotton plants exhibited squares approximately 3\\u2009mm in diameter), flowering and boll development (50% of cotton plants produced the first white flower), and boll opening (50% of cotton plants began to show opened bolls) stages were recorded in 2016 and 2017. The results of the survey are shown in Fig. 2. Table 1 shows the environmental conditions at different growth stages of cotton plants under the different planting systems. Cotton biomass was measured every 15 days beginning at 20 days after sowing (DAS) and continuing throughout the cotton growing season until harvest. Ten random cotton plants in the middle row of each plot were used to construct the plant map to avoid any boundary effects; for each replicate, two plants from each plot were randomly uprooted for biomass determination. Depending on the cotton developmental stage, the samples were separated into aboveground organs (stems, leaves, flowers, and bolls) and belowground organs (roots); afterward, the organs were oven dried at 80°C to a constant weight to determine their biomass. At the beginning of October, the number of cotton bolls within an area of 6.3\\u2009m2 (0.7 × 9\\u2009m) in the center two rows of the plots was investigated. Because the cotton bolls in each treatment did not mature at the same time, the bolls were manually harvested three times. The seed cotton was weighed after drying, and the seed cotton yield and boll weight were calculated; after ginning, the lint yield and boll cracking were determined. The effective temperature for cotton was equal to the average temperature minus the lower limit temperature for crop and root growth (15°C for cotton); the growth degree day (GDD) was equal to the accumulated daily effective temperature (Li et al., 2021).\\n\\nFig. 2\\nDownload : Download high-res image (106KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 2.

Soil water monitoring and SWC calculation\\nIn this study, the volumetric soil moisture contents (θ) were monitored by 5TE sensors (METER, USA). Thirty sensors were set as a group in the soil profile of the middle of each trial plot according to a spatial grid method (Liu et al., 2020); there was 20\\u2009cm of spacing in both the vertical and horizontal directions (Fig. 1C). The sensors were installed before the cotton was sown. When the sensor was set up in the soil, the excavated soil was placed in a fixed location, and after the sensors were installed, all the excavated soil was backfilled quantitatively, and the soil surface was leveled. In the profile grid, the horizontal position was divided into cotton rows (0–20\\u2009cm and 60–80\\u2009cm) and between rows (20–60\\u2009cm); the vertical positions were divided into shallow (10–40\\u2009cm), middle (40–70\\u2009cm), and deep (70–110\\u2009cm) layers (Fig. 1D). The soil dielectric apparent permittivity (εb) was collected by 5TE sensors and uploaded to the cloud with a 1-hour time interval of data collection. θ was estimated based on εb using the Topp equation (Visconti et al., 2014, Topp et al., 1980):\\n(1)\\nwhere a = 4.3×10−6, b= −5.5×10−6, c = 2.92×10−2, and d = 5.3×10−2.\\n\\nFor each planting system, a grid (i,j) file was created for the 30 sensor data; i and j represent the abscissa and ordinate, respectively. The total θ of each grid was calculated using Simpson’s 3/8 rule (Wu et al., 2023):\\n(2)\\n(3)\\n(4)\\nwhere [1, 3, 3, 2, …] is the coefficient vector, \\n is the depth of the grid points of row i and row j, \\n and \\n are the column spacing and row spacing of the grid data file, respectively, \\n is the ith cross-sectional area, \\n is the total volume of water on the specific measured cross section, \\n is the definite average value of the integral of the soil water content for each grid data file, and \\n is the area of the soil profile.\\n\\nThen, the cumulative SWC in the soil profile and water productivity were calculated using the following formulas (Wu et al., 2022a):\\n(5)\\n(6)\\n\\n2.5. Grid calculus for SWM calculation\\nThe x and y coordinates are interpolated more finely. After the soil profile of each time point was interpolated, a group of water data of 80 × 100 points formed. In this study, the kriging method was selected for interpolation; the value of the interpolation point was calculated by the following formula:\\n(7)\\n(8)\\n(9)\\nwhere Z∗(x0) is the kriging interpolation result of point x0, λi is the unknown weight coefficient, and C(xi, xj) is the covariance function of Z(xi) and Z(xj).\\n\\nAfter the grid data was interpolated, grid calculus is used to define and quantify the characteristics in the grid file that are not obvious from looking at a contour map or 3D wireframe of the grid. When a numerical derivative is needed, central difference formulas are used for the calculus computations. Because a central difference approach is used, values on both sides of the location for which the derivative is computed are needed. A compass-based grid notation is used to indicate the neighboring grid nodes for many of the grid calculus operations, as illustrated in Fig. 1E. Using this grid notation, we write the difference equation approximations for the necessary derivatives at location Z as follows:\\n(10)\\n(11)\\n(12)\\n(13)\\n(14)\\nwhere Z is a function of X and Y in a domain that includes point P. In the X-axis direction, the rate of change for Z is ∂z/∂x; the rate of change in the Y-axis direction for Z is ∂z/∂y. According to the definition of the directional derivative (Schwartz, 1974), the SWM, which is the slope of the SWC surface in a given direction, is calculated by the first derivative:\\n(15)\\nwhere α is the specified angle (Tuma, 1979). The α used for calculating the vertical soil water movement is −90°. For vertical SWM, a positive value indicates moving upward toward the y-axis origin, and a negative value indicates moving from the origin downward along the y-axis. The horizontal SWM calculation uses an α value equal to 0°. For the horizontal SWM, a positive value indicates moving away from the x-axis origin, and a negative value indicates moving toward the x-axis origin. Using compass-based grid notation, the equation takes the following form:\\n(16)\\n\\nWhen calculating the horizontal SWM in cotton rows at a horizontal position of 60–80\\u2009cm and that in between rows at a horizontal position of 40–60\\u2009cm, the value of the horizontal SWM is multiplied by −1 because the real horizontal SWM direction at 40–80\\u2009cm is contrary to that at 0–40\\u2009cm. That is, the movement toward the middle of the rows at 40–80\\u2009cm is represented by negative horizontal SWM, unlike that at 0–40\\u2009cm, which is represented by positive values. In a later correlation analysis, only the size of the horizontal SWM was considered, not the direction; thus, the absolute values of the horizontal SWM in cotton rows and horizontal SWM between rows were used.\\n\\n2.6. Statistics and software\\nThe least significant difference (LSD) method was used for significance analysis at the 0.05 level. Pearson correlation analysis was used for pairwise correlation, and path analysis was conducted using planting system, meteorological factors, soil water movement and consumption, crop biomass and the lint yield of cotton. Structural equation modeling (SEM) or path analysis allows researchers to model complex relational networks by evaluating the direct and indirect effects between variables (Bollen and Pearl, 2013). With SEM, researchers can clearly specify causal relationships between variables and validate these relationships by observing data. Path analysis mainly focuses on the direct paths between variables in the model. This enables researchers to identify which variables have a direct impact on other variables, thereby revealing potential causal relationships (Wu et al., 2023). In agriculture, ecology, and other fields, these methods have helped researchers better understand and explain the interactions between various factors (Guo et al., 2023). A logistic growth model was used to model belowground biomass dynamics with days after emergence (DAE).\\n\\nStata 16 and Microsoft Office Excel 2019 were used for data collation; statistical analyses were performed via SPSS 25.0, GraphPad Prism 8 and Origin 2021; and Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2019, Golden Software Surfer 18.0, GraphPad Prism 8, Origin 2021 and Adobe Illustrator CC 2019 were used for graphing.\\n\\n3. Results\\n3.1. Cotton growth and yield\\nThere were significant differences in cotton dry matter accumulation at different growth stages under the different cropping systems (Fig. 3). The biomasses of the different organs in the MC treatment group were the highest at the cotton seedling stage in both 2016 and 2017. There was no significant difference between WIC and WDC (except for the maximum belowground biomass in 2017). The dry matter variation trend of the different cropping systems at the cotton squaring stage was MC>WIC>WDC. During the cotton flowering and boll development stage, the maximum aboveground biomass and maximum belowground biomass were the greatest in the MC treatment and the smallest in the WIC treatment; the maximum leaf biomass was also the greatest in MC, but the smallest in WDC. By comparing the dynamics of cotton plant height under different cropping systems, it was found that the change trend was consistent over the past two years, with MC>WIC>WDC in each period (Supplementary Fig. 1). The lint yield and boll density in 2016 and 2017 and the boll weight, lint percentage and water productivity in 2017 were highest in MC, followed by WIC (Fig. 4). Compared with that of MC, the lint yields of WIC and WDC decreased by 18.0% and 46.7%, respectively.\\n\\nFig. 3\\nDownload : Download high-res image (252KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 3.

SWC distribution\\nThe SWC values of the three cotton planting systems in 2016 were basically greater than those in 2017; additionally, MC and WIC had higher SWC values mainly at the seedling and squaring stages in 2016 than in 2017, and WDC had higher SWC values mainly at the squaring stage in 2016 than in 2017 (Fig. 5A). In 2017, the deep SWC values of the three planting modes at depths of 70–110\\u2009cm in the flowering and boll development stage were greater than those in 2016. For MC, the SWC in 2016 was mainly concentrated in the shallow (10–40\\u2009cm) and middle (40–70\\u2009cm) layers; in 2017, the SWC was mainly concentrated at the shallow layer, and the SWC values at different horizontal positions of the same depth exhibited small variations. The SWC distributions of WIC and WDC at different horizontal positions at the same depth were largely different. The SWC distribution in WIC at the seedling stage was similar to that in MC, which was greater than that in WDC; however, the SWC distribution at the squaring stage exhibited an obvious inverted V shape, while that in WDC presented an irregular distribution. The SWC of the soil profile in WDC at 10–110\\u2009cm was obviously lower than that in MC and WIC. Fig. 5B shows that the SWCs in the cotton rows and between rows under the three planting systems at the cotton squaring stage in 2016 were obviously greater than those in 2017. However, the SWC in between rows at the flowering and boll development stage in 2016 was lower than that in 2017. The use of different cotton planting systems and growth stages significantly affected the SWC in between rows. MC had the largest SWC values in the three stages of 2016 and in the seedling and flowering and boll development stages of 2017; however, the lowest SWC occurred in the squaring stage of 2017. There were no significant differences between SWCs in cotton rows in MC and WIC at the seedling or squaring stage in 2016. In 2017, the SWC between rows and the SWC in cotton rows was significantly greater in WIC at the squaring stage than in MC. In 2017, the SWC of the WIC at the squaring stage was the largest; in other cases, the WIC was significantly lower than that of the MC. The SWC in WDC was significantly greater than that in WIC at the flowering and boll development stage. The SWC in WDC was greatest between rows at the squaring stage in 2017 and lowest at other times.\\n\\nFig. 5\\nDownload : Download high-res image (811KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 5.

Vertical SWM\\nIn Fig. 6A, positive values represent upward SWM, negative values represent downward SWM, and the color depth represents the value. The vertical SWM of the soil profile in 2017 had obvious stratification, and the different soil layers exhibited great variation; the upward movement of water was mainly concentrated in the shallow soil. Relative to 2017, there was a significantly greater increase in the SWM in the middle depth range of the soil profile in 2016 at the seedling stage and squaring stage; moreover, the SWM was lower in 2016 at the flowering and boll development stage. In 2016, the upward SWM in MC in the shallow soil layer exhibited few differences among the three growth stages, and there was a large SWM in the middle layer at the squaring stage. In 2017, the water movement in the MC soil profile clearly followed the order of seedling stage<squaring stage<flower and boll development stage. In 2016, the SWM of WIC at the seedling stage was similar to that of MC; however, there was a greater downward SWM in the middle and deep soil layers (70–110\\u2009cm) at the squaring and flowering and boll development stages. In 2017, WIC had a greater SWM in the shallow layer at the seedling stage; its middle layer SWM mainly moved downward. The SWM of the shallow layer in the WDC varied greatly with the horizontal position. In 2016, the middle- and deep-layer SWMs were mainly downward. In 2017, the middle- and deep-layer, the SWM was upward. Fig. 6B shows that the vertical SWM under the three planting systems in 2016 generally increased. The SWM values at the seedling and squaring stages were basically greater than those in 2017; moreover, the difference in the vertical SWM caused by the different planting systems in 2017 was more significant. In 2016, the vertical SWM variations in cotton rows and between rows of WIC at the squaring stage were obvious; in other cases, the vertical SWM trend between cotton rows and between rows were basically similar. In 2017, WIC had a significant maximum vertical SWM value at different horizontal positions at the seedling stage; at the squaring stage, WIC had a significant minimum vertical SWM value. There were no significant differences in the vertical SWM between MC and WDC at the seedling stage during the two years. However, in other cases, the vertical SWM of WDC was significantly lower than that of MC.\\n\\nFig. 6\\nDownload : Download high-res image (1MB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 6.

Nevertheless, accurately quantifying irrigation schedules in diverse climates and soil textures remains a complex challenge. Here, a three-year irrigation experiment (2020–2022) of greenhouse tomato was conducted at three typical locations (Yulin, Yangling and Hanzhong) in northwest China. The irrigation schedules were determined by the cumulative evaporation (CE) measured from a 20\\u202fcm pan. A total nine treatments were set by combining three irrigation frequencies (IF) with three single doses (ID). Twenty indices related to tomato growth, photosynthesis, yield and water use, fruit quality, and environmental benefit were evaluated comprehensively by using TOPSIS (technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution) and GRA (grey relational analysis) methods of combining weights based on game theory. The results showed that the indicator with highest weight was yield, followed by crop water productivity and vitamin C. The optimal ranges of irrigation frequency (irrigation dose) were determined as follows: 10.00–11.08\\u202fmm (0.81–0.90 CE) in Yulin, 13.12–15.68\\u202fmm (0.77–0.89 CE) in Yangling, and 11.44–16.40\\u202fmm (0.67–0.77 CE) in Hanzhong, respectively. This study introduces a method applied to prioritize the key indicators for irrigation scheduling, providing a reference for optimizing irrigation practices in greenhouse tomato production and improving water management in agriculture.\\n\\nPrevious article in issueNext article in issue\\nKeywords\\nIrrigation frequencyIrrigation doseClimateSoil textureDecision-making\\n1. Introduction\\nIrrigation is crucial to sustainable agricultural development and food security in arid and semi-arid regions. Drip irrigation, recognized as a water-saving technology at the field scale, is extensively employed in greenhouse production (Van der Kooij et al., 2013). It is common for growers to determine irrigation events empirically based on personal experience and the weather forecast, which aggravates the waste of water resources, reduces production profit, and hinders the sustainability of the environment (Exner et al., 2014). Moreover, the expansion of irrigated areas and irrational use of water resources in these areas have led to severe water scarcity issues (Zhang et al., 2021a), highlighting the urgency of optimizing irrigation management.\\n\\nIrrigation frequency (IF) and irrigation dose (ID) directly determine the soil water distribution (Kisi et al., 2021), thus affecting root development and plant growth. Excessive irrigation can lead to a decline of crop nutrition quality (e.g., sugar, protein, and vitamin C) and environmental issues (e.g., soil salinization and groundwater pollution) (Chen et al., 2014, Exner et al., 2014). Appropriate irrigation frequency can promote nutritional quality (Du et al., 2017), yet the impact on yield remains unclear and varies with species and regions (Kumar et al., 2022). The design of IF and ID, that is, when and how much water to irrigate, should be quantified to balance the benefits of irrigation on crop yield and fruit quality with environmental concerns.\\n\\nAccurately assessing the specific environmental conditions and soil characteristics of a particular area is crucial for determining the ideal irrigation schedules that promote optimal plant growth and efficient water use (McCarthy et al., 2023). The reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) is mainly determined by environmental factors, such as vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and solar radiation (Rn). The distribution of soil water varies across different soil textures following irrigation events, resulting in distinct wetting patterns (Karimi et al., 2020). Sandy soils may benefit from more frequent but smaller doses than loamy soils (Saha et al., 2020, Zhang et al., 2023). However, challenges remain in precisely quantifying irrigation frequency and dose to adapt to different climates and soil textures.\\n\\nA common method for estimating crop ET0 is using evaporation from a 20\\u202fcm pan as a proxy; this method can be used to guide irrigation practices in greenhouses (He et al., 2021). Mathematical approaches that evaluate the growth of crops have been widely used to optimize water-saving irrigation schemes (Liu et al., 2021), such as analytic hierarchy process, entropy method, game theory, and principal component analysis (Qu et al., 2022, Yu et al., 2023). To address these limitations of single evaluation method, a scientific comprehensive evaluation approach that integrates both objective and subjective approaches, was proposed to increase the robustness and universality of results (Yang et al., 2023). The comprehensive evaluation was achieved through various methods, such as the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) and the gray relational analysis method (GRA), which have been acknowledged as efficient tool to optimize irrigation schedules (Qu et al., 2022, Wang et al., 2023).\\n\\nGreenhouse tomatoes are a major horticultural commodity worldwide. The complex climate and diverse soil textures in Northwest China pose great challenges in making efficient irrigation schedules of greenhouse tomatoes under water shortages (Qiu et al., 2013, Zheng et al., 2013). We conducted a three-year irrigation trial for greenhouse tomatoes in three typical regions of Shaanxi Province, representing the majority of soil textures and climates in Northwest China (Fig. S1 and Table S1). We aimed to: (ⅰ) develop a comprehensive evaluation system to assess the impact of different irrigation schedules on tomato growth, photosynthesis, yield and water use, fruit quality, and environmental benefit; (ⅱ) quantify the effects of irrigation frequency and dose on comprehensive evaluation results; and (ⅲ) determine the optimal irrigation schedules for greenhouse tomatoes under different soil textures.\\n\\n2. Materials and methods\\n2.1. Experimental sites\\nThe trials were conducted at three locations in Shaanxi Province, Northwest China (Fig. S1): the Academy of Agricultural Sciences experimental station (38.24°N, 109.77°E) in Yulin (denoted YL); the Northwest A&F University experimental station (34.26°N, 108.04°E) in Yangling (denoted LY); and the Academy of Agricultural Sciences experimental station (33.08°N, 107.04°E) in Hanzhong (denoted HZ). The greenhouses at each site were the same size: 85\\u202fm (length) × 17\\u202fm (width) × and 4\\u202fm (height). Based on the FAO classification system (FAO, 1990), the soils in three test greenhouses were classified as sandy loam, loam, and silty clay, respectively. The physicochemical characteristics of the three soil textures at 0–60\\u202fcm depth are shown in Table 1. Soil particle sizes were measured with a particle size analyzer, Mastersizer 2000 (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, England). The soil hydraulic properties, including soil water retention and soil hydraulic conductivity curve (Fig. S2), were determined using pressure plate method (Ankeny, 1992) and RETC software (Van Genuchten et al., 1991). The daily solar radiation (Rn) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) inside the greenhouse were collected and calculated by using a standard automatic weather logger (HOBO Event Data Logger, Onset Computer Corp., USA) located in the middle of each greenhouse.\\n\\nTable 1.

Experimental design\\nTomato seedlings (Solanum lycopersicum L. cv. Jinpeng) were transplanted into a greenhouse when they reached the fifth-leaf stage. To ensure plant survival, all plots were immediately supplemented with 20\\u2009mm of water. The planting pattern in each plot consisted of two rows of tomatoes with two drip lines (Fig. 2a). Each plot measured 6\\u2009m × 1.2\\u2009m and accommodated 40 seedlings planted with 50\\u2009cm row spacing. The drippers were positioned 30\\u2009cm apart along each drip line to align with the position of each plant, and each dripper had a discharge rate of 1.8\\u2009L\\u2009h−1. A water meter was installed in each plot to record the amount of supplied water accurately. 45\\u2009t/ha of well-rotted organic manure (sheep manure) were applied as base fertilizer before transplanting. 350\\u2009kg/ha of compound fertilizer (19% N, 19% P2O5, 19% K2O) were evenly divided into four parts and applied during the first, second, third, and fourth ear fruit began to expand.\\n\\nFig. 1\\nDownload : Download high-res image (1MB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 1.

(c) The layout of experimental plots.\\n\\nIrrigation trials were conducted simultaneously from August to December in 2020, 2021, and 2022 at three sites involving three levels of irrigation frequency and dose (Fig. 2b). Irrigation was triggered by cumulative evaporation (CE) from a 20\\u2009cm pan—not a standard pan worldwide, but commonly used in China for estimating ET0. The pan, with a diameter of 20\\u2009cm and a depth of 11\\u2009cm, was positioned 20\\u2009cm above the plant canopy. Evaporation measurement was conducted daily at 08:00\\u2009a.m. using a specifically calibrated glass-graduated flask (Liu et al., 2019). The plants were irrigated at 08:10\\u2009a.m. when the CE reached specific thresholds, namely 20±2\\u2009mm for the low frequency (IF1), 15±2\\u2009mm for the medium frequency (IF2), and 10±2\\u2009mm for the high frequency (IF3). Three irrigation doses were set: low (ID0.5=0.5 CE), medium (ID0.7=0.7 CE), and high (ID0.9=0.9 CE). Each irrigation frequency was combined with three different irrigation doses, resulting in nine treatments. Each treatment was randomly assigned three replicates (Fig. 2c). To prevent water disturbance between the plots, a plastic film was used to separate the plots to a depth of 60\\u2009cm. Considering the specific water demand patterns of tomatoes during different growth stages, it is recommended to adjust the irrigation amount at different growth stages by multiplying a coefficient (Allen et al., 1998). The coefficient values for the initial, middle, and late stages were quantified as 0.6, 1.15, and 0.8, respectively. The irrigation events, including irrigation times, irrigation intervals, and cumulative irrigation amount, are illustrated in Fig. 3.\\n\\nFig. 3\\nDownload : Download high-res image (774KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 3. The process of irrigation application in three test greenhouses (Yulin, Yangling and Hanzhong) during the tomato growing seasons of 2020, 2021, and 2022.\\n\\n2.3. Measurements\\n2.3.1. Growth data\\nFour plants were randomly sampled from each plot to measure the plant height (PHT, cm) and total dry matter accumulation (TDW, g/plant) at the end of trial. The total dry matter accumulation and root/shoot ratio (R/S, %) was calculated as follows:\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n\\nFour plants were selected from each plot and the leaf area was measured using a Li-3000 leaf area meter (Li-Cor, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). The leaf area index (LAI, m2/m2) was then computed as follows:\\n(3)\\n\\n2.3.2. Photosynthetic indices\\nThe photosynthetic indices, including net photosynthesis rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr), stomatal conductance (Gs), and intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), serve as key parameters in evaluating tomato physiological responses. On a sunny day during the tomato fruiting period, measurements of these four parameters were taken from the latest fully expanded leaf between 9:00\\u2009am and 11:00\\u2009am, using a portable photosynthetic system (Li-6800, Li-Cor, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). The light intensity was set at 1000 μmol/m2/s with a ratio of 90% red to 10% blue light, and the CO2 concentration in the leaf chamber was maintained at 400 μmol/mol. The relative humidity in the leaf chamber was kept at 70%, the temperature was set to 28 ℃ and the flow rate was set to 500 μmol/s. Three plants were selected from each plot and recordings were taken once the leaf reached steady state in leaf chamber.\\n\\n2.3.3. Yield and water use\\nTen plants were randomly selected in the center of each plot to determine the tomato marketable yield per hectare (t/ha) and single fruit weight (SFW, g). Crop water productivity (WP, kg/m3) was calculated as follows (Fernández et al., 2020):\\n(4)\\nwhere ET is the total evapotranspiration (mm), which was calculated using the following soil water balance equation:\\n(5)\\nwhere P is the effective precipitation (mm); \\n is the irrigation amount (mm); U is the groundwater recharge (mm); R is surface runoff (mm); \\n is (mm) deep drainage; \\n is the change in 0–60\\u2009cm soil water storage from the beginning to the end of the trial (mm). Because experiments were conducted in greenhouse, P was ignored; Here, the groundwater table was far below plant root zone, so U was assumed to be zero; R was considered to be ignored as the terrain is flat; below 60\\u2009cm, the soil water content (SWC) remained consistently stable before and after irrigation cycle, with SWC values at 60\\u2009cm depth in Yulin, Yangling, and Hanzhong holding steady at 0.1264, 0.1627, and 0.2213\\u2009cm³ cm-³, respectively. Thus, the above equation can be simplified as follows:\\n(6)\\n\\n2.3.4. Fruit quality\\nThe third ear of matured fruit from four plants in each plot was sampled to measure the fruit quality of tomato. Fruit firmness (FF, kg/m2) was measured at the equatorial location with a hardometer (GY-3 Top, Hangzhou, China). Soluble sugar content (SSC, mg/g) was measured using the anthrone method (Liu et al., 2013). Soluble protein content (SPC, mg/g) was measured using Coomassie Brilliant Blue method (Akubor and Ogbadu, 2003). Vitamin C (VC, mg/kg) was calculated by the standard titration method with the 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenols sodium salt solution (Stevens et al., 2006). Lycopene content (LC, mg/100\\u2009g) was extracted by organic solvent extraction (Dannehl et al., 2014). Fruit total soluble solids (TSS, %) was measured with a handheld saccharometer (ATAGO, PR-32, Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).\\n\\n2.3.5. Nutrients residue in the soil after harvest\\nAfter the tomatoes were harvested, soil samples were collected from the 0–20, 20–40, and 40–60\\u2009cm soil layers using a soil auger. Samples were collected along the profile, starting at the midpoint of two drippers in a drip belt. Soil NO3--N (SAN) and available P (SAP) were tested with AA3 continuous flow Analyzer (Auto Analyzer-III, German Bran). An atomic absorption spectrometer (Hitachi Z-2000, Tokyo, Japan) was used for testing soil available K (SAK). The calculation of soil NO3--N (or available P or available K) was as follows (Lu et al., 2019):\\n(7)\\nwhere S denotes the soil NO3--N (or available P or available K) accumulation (kg/ha), C represents the soil NO3--N (or available P or available K) content (mg/kg), H is the soil layer thickness (cm), and BD is the soil bulk density (g/cm3).\\n\\n2.4.

Results\\n3.1. Variation of environmental factors in three test greenhouses\\nThe average values of Rn and VPD, as well as PE, exhibited a decreasing trend from Yulin to Yangling and Hanzhong (Fig. 1). Specifically, the average Rn (average VPD, total PE) over three years ranged as follows in Yulin, Yangling, and Hanzhong: 6.16–6.48 MJ/m2 (0.79–0.85 kPa, 355.0–366.3\\u2009mm), 5.11–5.51 MJ/m2 (0.62–0.70 kPa, 301.5–322.4\\u2009mm) and 4.37–4.91 MJ/m2 (0.50–0.56 kPa, 268.1–285.1\\u2009mm), respectively. Yulin, with the highest values of PE, demonstrated the most irrigation times (e.g., 37 times for IF3ID0.5 in 2020) and total irrigation amount (e.g., 340.3\\u2009mm for IF3ID0.9 in 2022) (Fig. 3).\\n\\n3.2. Multifactorial analysis\\nThe ANOVAs and correlation analysis among 20 indices was conducted to establish a scientific and reasonable comprehensive evaluation system for greenhouse tomato. Fig. 5 demonstrated that the variables S, IF, ID, as well as their two-way interactions (S\\nIF, S\\nID and IF\\nID), and three-way interaction (S\\nIF\\nID), had a significant influence (p < 0.01) on the majority of the indices. Moreover, the results of Pearson correlation analysis showed a significant correlation among many subfactor indicators (Fig. 6). Specifically, the subfactor indicators within the same factor had a significant positive (P < 0.05) correlation with each other, except for the subfactors (e.g., Yield and. WP) within yield and water use. SFW and Yield displayed a significant positive correlation with the subfactors (e.g., PHT and Pn) in growth and photosynthesis, while a negative correlation with the subfactors (e.g., SSC and SAN) in fruit quality and environmental benefit.\\n\\nFig. 5\\nDownload : Download high-res image (638KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 5.

Therefore, it is essential to optimize proper irrigation management to improve the grain yield, crop water productivity (WPc), economic crop water productivity (EWPc), and lower global warming potential (GWP) and GWP Intensity (GWPI). The effect of irrigation scheduling and irrigation methods on GHG emissions remains largely unknown, even though this knowledge is essential to optimize the irrigation management. To address this knowledge gap, a field experiment was carried out in the North China Plain (NCP) for three winter wheat seasons to measure the influence of different irrigation methods and irrigation scheduling on WPc, EWPc, GWP, and GWPI. Irrigation scheduling including 50%, 60%, and 70% of the field capacity (FC) were kept in the main plots and irrigation methods, including sprinkler, drip, and flood irrigation methods in the sub-plots. The results revealed that relative to sprinkler irrigation at 60% FC, drip irrigation at 60% FC significantly (p < 0.05) improved the yield 4.89–7.52%, WPc 1.0–5.4%, EWPc 1.1–5.49%, lower GWP 7.47–9.34%, and GWPI 10.92–15.23%. Compared with flood irrigation at 60% FC, drip irrigation at 60% FC increased grain yield 5.34–6.81%, WPc 5.65–15.1%, EWPc 5.73–15.12%, lower GWP 10.36–15.16%, and GWPI 16.22–19.40%. Technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) presented that compared with sprinkler and flood irrigation at 60% FC irrigation scheduling, drip irrigation at 60% FC irrigation scheduling provides the best results for improved the yield, WPc, and EWPc, and optimal balance in GWP and GWPI. Therefore, the irrigation scheduling of 60% FC combined with drip irrigation is suggested for sustained wheat yield, improved WPc and EWPc, and mitigated GWP in the NCP.\\n\\nPrevious article in issueNext article in issue\\nAbbreviations\\nCO2Carbon dioxideCH4MethaneETcCrop evapotranspirationFCField capacityGHGGreenhouse gasGWPGlobal warming potentialGWPIGlobal warming potential intensityHIHarvest indexKPotassiumNNitrogenN2ONitrous oxideNCPNorth China PlainPPhosphorousSWCSoil water contentTOPSISTechnique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal SolutionWPcCrop water productivityEWPcEconomic crop water productivity\\nKeywords\\nIrrigation managementClimate changeGlobal warming potentialCrop Water Productivity (WPc)North China Plain (NCP)TOPSIS method\\n1. Introduction\\nClimate change caused by the globally rising concentration of greenhouse gases (GHG) results in a significant increase in extreme events (such as flooding, fires, and heatwaves) and their intensity. Therefore, reducing GHG emissions can minimize the possibility of future extreme events (Almazroui et al., 2021). To mitigate the effects of climate change on humans, reducing GHG emissions and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 is the only way to meet this target (Allen et al., 2018). Global average carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions levels have reached 409.9 ppm, 1866.3 ppb, and 332.1 ppb, which increased by 5.0%, 3.5%, and 2.4%, respectively in the past decade (IPCC, 2021). It is estimated that agriculture shared about 20% of the total GHG emissions and contributed 84% and 52% of global total N2O and CH4 emissions, respectively (IPCC, 2013). Agricultural activities will have an essential role in anthropogenic GHG emissions mitigation. Abundant studies focused on the effects of fertilization (Abubakar et al., 2022, Chi et al., 2020, Li et al., 2020, Mboyerwa et al., 2022, Rahman et al., 2021, Saeed et al., 2022), crop rotation (Xiao et al., 2022), and tillage (Bhattacharyya et al., 2022, Fangueiro et al., 2017) on GHG emissions, but seldom research concerned on the study of irrigation practices on GHG emissions (Gao et al., 2021, Guardia et al., 2023, Trost et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2016, Zhang et al., 2023). Therefore, investigating the effect of irrigation managment practices on GHG emissions from cropped land is essential for estimating their impact on climate change and mitigating their emissions.\\n\\nSoil moisture is generally regulated by irrigation, which is essential for modifying the emission and uptake of CO2, N2O, and CH4 (Fangueiro et al., 2017, Scheer et al., 2012). Irrigation scheduling and irrigation methods have an impact on soil moisture and crop water balance, which has an impact on emission and uptake of N2O, CO2, and CH4 (Mehmood et al., 2019, Mehmood et al., 2021). For instance, Scheer et al. (2012) observed the effect of sprinkler irrigation under high irrigation [irrigation at 50% of the plant available water capacity (PAWC) depleted; with total irrigation depth 275 mm], medium irrigation (60% of the PAWC; 174 mm) and low irrigation (85% of PAWC; 127 mm) scheduling on soil CO2 and N2O emissions in Australia from irrigated cotton fields. They found that compared with medium and low irrigation scheduling treatments, higher irrigation scheduling produced higher average CO2 emissions approximately 12.75% and 51.32%, respectively. Whereas, medium irrigation scheduling treatment had higher average N2O emission approximately 30.17% and 32.75%, compared with higher and low irrigation scheduling treatments, respectively. Moreover, higher irrigation scheduling treatments produced 48% and 53.15% lower N2O intensity compared with medium and low irrigation scheduling treatments, respectively. Li et al. (2019) observed lower irrigation (total irrigation amount 420 mm) level emitted higher CO2 emissions, higher CH4 uptake, and lower N2O emissions, decreased global warming potential (GWP) and GWP Intensity (GWPI), compared with higher irrigation (total irrigation amount 630 mm) level from winter wheat fields in the North China Plain (NCP). Sanchez-Martín et al. (2010) investigated that in comparison with flood irrigation (total amount of water applied 325 mm), drip irrigation (205 mm) reduced N2O emissions 75% from melon fields in the semiarid region. Similarly, Kennedy et al. (2013) observed that compared with furrow irrigation (approximately 640–760 mm of total irrigation water), drip irrigation reduced N2O emissions from the tomato crop with higher yield and water use. Wang et al. (2016) estimated 3.7% lower CO2 emissions, 31.30% higher CH4 uptake, 16.25% lower N2O emission, and 12.47% higher irrigation water use efficiency from the surface drip irrigation compared with the sprinkler irrigation when an equal volume of water was applied (800 m3 ha-1). While, surface drip irrigation compared with flood irrigation lowered 2.1% CO2 emissions, 18.66% higher CH4 uptake, 14.57% lower N2O emission, and 44.2% higher irrigation water use efficiency, when 50% less amount of water was applied from winter wheat field. On the contrary, Guo et al. (2017) observed 11.4% higher soil CO2 emissions under drip irrigation (total irrigation amount 1050 m3 hm-2) compared with flood irrigation from maize fields in the NCP. Li et al. (2020) observed that irrigation methods had substantial effect on CO2 emissions but the irrigation scheduling had no effect on CO2 emissions. They found that drip irrigation compared with border irrigation raised 24.7% CO2 emissions and reduced 23.5% N2O emissions. Drip irrigation with high irrigation frequency obtained the best yield, water productivity, GWP, GWPI, and net ecosystem economic budget, compared with border irrigation. Wang et al. (2022) concluded that an improper irrigation scheduling lowered the yield, while excessive irrigation scheduling caused higher GHG emissions and higher water consumption. While the lower irrigation scheduling increased yield by 2.2–3.1%, increased water productivity 12.8–13.1%, reduced GWP by 6.0–6.6%, and decreased GWPI by 9.0–9.2%, compared with higher irrigation scheduling. Gao et al. (2021) observed the flood and drip irrigation had 22.1% and 35.7% higher grain yield, and 34.2% and 35.6% higher net ecosystem economic budget compared with no irrigation, respectively. Moreover, irrigation treatments had higher grain yield 44.5–203.9%, increased GWP 12–32.8%, and decreased GWPI by 24.3–57.4%, compared with no irrigation treatment, respectively. These studies shows that impact of irrigation scheduling and irrigation methods on soil GHG emissions are controversial and varied with climate, soils, and crops. Additionally, there is a lack of comprehensive evaluation (irrigation scheduling and methods, crop yield, economics, etc.) of irrigation management based on GHG reduction.\\n\\nThe NCP is the utmost important region for food production; it holds about 25% of the cultivable area and produces about 71% of China’s total wheat output (NBSC, 2015). The NCP experiences an irregular rainfall pattern, with more than 70% of the annual rainfall occurring from July to September (Du et al., 2014). This irregularity significantly impacts crop yield development in the region. Lack of reliable surface water sources, groundwater serves as the primary irrigation source in NCP (Yang et al., 2015). To conserve water resources and simultaneously sustain wheat production, developing water-saving such as drip and sprinkler irrigation technology for winter wheat is an inevitable choice in this region (Xu et al., 2016). On the contrary, the potential drawback of drip and sprinkler irrigation methods are higher CO2-eq emissions from production and construction, and higher energy input compared with traditional irrigation methods. For example, Zou et al. (2015) measured that flood irrigation had 84.5% and 82.2% lowest per unit area CO2-eq emission from production and construction compared with drip and sprinkler irrigation, respectively. Conversely, the total CO2-eq emissions resulting from flood irrigation compared with drip and sprinkler irrigation, were 186.4% and 130.3% greater due to extensive area of coverage, respectively. Even though, when considering the CO2-eq emissions during the production and operation of drip and sprinkler irrigation methods, GHG emissions are proportional to the water productivity. Drip and sprinkler irrigation methods have a higher water productivity; thus, they are an effective tool to mitigate GHG emission in irrigated lands. Additionally, Jamali et al. (2021) measured that maximum energy input in drip irrigation (75.59 GJ ha-1) followed by flood irrigation (62.67 GJ ha-1) and sprinkler irrigation (49.81 GJ ha-1) methods. About one-third of total energy input consumption in drip irrigation was belonged to polyethylene pipes. In traditional irrigation and sprinkler irrigation system 32.77% and 36.2% belonged to diesel fuel consumption, respectively. Whereas, drip irrigation compared with traditional and sprinkler irrigation reduced water requirement by 43.7% and 39.6% and electricity consumption by 36.5% and 25.2%, respectively. Moreover, drip irrigation reduced 26.10% and 11.14% total GWP compared with traditional and sprinkler irrigation, respectively. Drip and sprinkler irrigation methods had a beneficial effect on GHG mitigation, and even greater reductions could be achieved by adopting these methods. Furthermore, compared with traditional methods drip and sprinkler irrigation methods conserve energy by reducing the volume of pumping water (Zou et al., 2012).\\n\\nIn the NCP, farmers under traditional cultivation practices usually irrigate 4–5 times winter wheat in the growing seasons (Li et al., 2005). Wang et al. (2012) had observed 50–60% of field capacity (FC; amount of soil water retained in the soil after free water passes through the soil profile due to gravity) is the optimum crop water productivity (WPc; crop yield obtained per unit of water used for irrigation) of winter wheat using drip irrigation in the NCP. Moreover, Zhang et al. (2000) measured soil water content of 60% FC is minimum limit index for normal growth, crop development, and optimum yield of winter wheat. Therefore, the current study adopted three water scheduling levels of 50% (low), 60% (medium), and 70% (high) FC to assess the influence on crop yield and GHG emissions. Local farmers usually adopted these irrigation scheduling levels to obtain higher yield in the NCP. This study evaluated yield and GHG emissions under three irrigation scheduling with three irrigation methods (surface drip irrigation, sprinkler irrigation, and flood irrigation) in winter wheat fields. This study aims to investigate the effects of different irrigation scheduling and methods on the GHG emission, grain yield, WPc, economic crop water productivity (EWPc), GWP, and GWPI (CO2-eq emissions per unit grain yield). Moreover, the novelty of this study is to identify optimum irrigation scheduling and irrigation method by a comprehensive evaluation technique that can simultaneously increase grain yield, WPc, EWPc, and reduce GWP and GWPI based on three wheat growing seasons in the field. This evaluation technique have the potential to be applied in other regions and for assessing any measurable cropland management practice. Results of this study will provide the valuable data to researchers and farmers in the NCP to implement feasible and environmentally sustainable irrigation practice. Further, the collected data could provide significant information for regions sharing similar global climatic conditions.\\n\\n2. Materials and methods\\n2.1. Experimental design\\nField experiments were conducted during three consecutive winter wheat seasons from October to June 2016–2019 at Qiliying experimental station for Farmland Irrigation Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agriculture Sciences, the Xinxiang City of Henan Province on the NCP (35°08’N, 113°45’E, elevation 81 m). The climatic data records were collected from an automatic weather station located adjacent to the field. The atmospheric temperature and rainfall during the three seasons (from first irrigation to harvest) is shown in Fig. 1. The primary soil physical properties are mentioned in Table 1. Section S1 in supplementary material presented the description of the experimental site. The soil organic matter content of 1.14 g kg-1, the electrical conductivity of 144.43 μS cm-1, and the pH of the experimental site was 8.70. The average available soil N content was 43.1 mg kg-1, P of 15.0 mg kg-1, and K of 126.0 mg kg-1.\\n\\nFig. 1\\nDownload : Download high-res image (145KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 1.

(2021). The size of the main plot was 98\\u2009×\\u200918\\u2009m (length × width), and the subplot was 10\\u2009×\\u20095\\u2009m (length × width). The experimental design was a split-plot design method with a total of nine treatments named D50, D60, D70, S50, S60, S70, F50, F60, and F70 (D: surface drip irrigation, S: sprinkler irrigation, F: Flood irrigation, and subscripts presented the irrigation scheduling level). For each irrigation event, irrigation scheduling was set on FC in the effective root depth of 1\\u2009m. The irrigation scheduling was decided on the measured soil water content (SWC) measured after every three days. Irrigation scheduling was determined by measuring SWC using TRIME-PICO TDR (T3/IPH44, IMKO, Germany) tube placed at 0.20\\u2009m span up to 1\\u2009m depth soil profile in each plot. When the SWC for each treatment was lower than 50%, 60%, or 70% FC the plots of that treatments were irrigated manually. All treatments were replicated thrice. Sprinkler and drip irrigation dose were kept at 30\\u2009mm while flood irrigation 60\\u2009mm (minimum desirable to inundate the field) to avoid deep percolation (Jha et al., 2017). Table S1 presested the irrigation scheduling date, total irrigation amount, and soil water balance in the top 1\\u2009m soil profile during 2016–2017, 2017–2018, and 2018–2019 growing seasons for all treatments.\\n\\n2.2. Crop management\\nThe land was prepared by tractor-drawn rototiller to a depth of 0.20\\u2009m while larger soil clods were smoothed by a harrow to form a leveled seedbed. Winter wheat cultivar “Zhoumai 22” was sown on October 16, 2016, October 22, 2017, and October 16, 2018, with a row spacing of 0.20\\u2009m at a rate of 180\\u2009kg\\u2009ha-1. The previous crop was summer maize in three experimental seasons. In all treatments, the basal dose of fertilizer N (as ammonium nitrate), P (as calcium super-phosphate), and K (as potassium sulfate) was applied with the ratio of 4:3:1 (Mehmood et al., 2021). The N (ammonium nitrate) was used at the rate of 300\\u2009kg\\u2009ha-1 scattered manually in the sprinkler, drip, and flood irrigation treatment on day of the year 98 in 2016–2017, day of the year 104 in 2017–2018, and day of the year 91 in 2018–2019 followed by irrigation.\\n\\n2.3. Harvesting, grain yield, and harvest index measurement\\nHarvesting was held manually from each 1\\u2009m2 treatment plot randomly on May 31, 2017 and 2018, and June 4, 2019. Wheat grains were cleaned manually, natural-dried to a moisture level of 12% (Gao et al., 2014), and were weighted by a precise digital balance (Ohaus, AX224 Adventurer, Parsippany, NJ, USA). The harvest index (HI) was estimated as follows (Ali et al., 2007):\\n(1)\\n\\n2.4. Crop water productivity and economic crop water productivity\\nThe crop evapotranspiration (ETc) was measured by using the soil water balance equation (Hillel, 1998) as follows:\\n(2)\\n\\nwhere ETc is the crop evapotranspiration, P is rainfall; I is the amount of irrigation, U is the upward capillary rise from the soil profile below 1\\u2009m and considered zero due the water table being about 30\\u2009m below the soil surface. Dw is the drainage beneath the 1\\u2009m soil profile, and measured following Sun et al. (2006); R is the surface runoff and neglected due to suitable bund height (0.25\\u2009m) around the subblocks, and ΔS is the change in soil water storage (final-initial) in the 1\\u2009m soil profile.\\n\\nThe WPc was calculated by dividing the grain yield with ETc as following Kijne et al. (2003):\\n(3)\\n\\nThe EWPc represents the ratio of winter wheat yield profit to the total amount of water involved in crop production (TWU) was determined as follows (Fernández et al., 2020).\\n(4)\\n(5)\\n\\nTWU is the total amount of water involved in crop production. Where LF is the leaching fraction and N-BWU is the non-beneficial water use (percolation and runoff). LF and N-BWU was considered negligible, thus ETc was used as TWU. The current grain yield price was adopted from the local market prices of 2400 Chinese Yuan per ton in 2016.\\n\\n2.5. Gas sample analysis\\nSoil CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes were collected in the field using the static chamber and gas chromatography method (Zhao et al., 2009). The chamber was made of a stainless-steel plate with a thickness of 1\\u2009mm having a geometric dimension of 0.5\\u2009m x 0.5\\u2009m x 0.5\\u2009m (Mehmood et al., 2019). The detailed explanation of the gas chamber method and its role in measurement process is reported in Sapkota et al. (2014). Two 12\\u2009V DC battery-powered fans were used to mix the air inside the chamber. The chambers were mounted on stainless steel frames that were permanently inserted 0.1\\u2009m into the soil to prevent lateral movement throughout the experiment. The frame had a 0.05\\u2009m deep grove on the base upper end to put a chamber on it. Before sampling, the groove was filled with water to ensure an airtight seal. In the chamber, two rows of wheat were sown. Inside the chambers, fertilization and irrigation events occurred in the same way as outside in the field. The chambers were water-sealed, attached to the base frame using 100\\u2009mL plastic syringes attached to a three-way stopcock. Four gas samples were collected at 0, 10, 20, and 30\\u2009min as recommended for accurate calculation of gas flux (Rochette, 2011) and then injected into 12-mL evacuated glass tubes. For 0–30\\u2009min duration chamber air temperature was measured using a sensor probe (JM624, Jinming Instrument CO., Ltd., Tianjin, China). GHG sampling were performed from day of the year 96–149, 96–151, and 91–150 in 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. In total there were 9 sampling events in 2017 and 17 sampling events in 2018 and 2019. A gas chromatography system (Shimadzu 2010 plus, Shimadzu Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) was used to analyze the GHG samples.\\n\\nGHG emissions were measured using the following equation (Song et al., 2003).\\n(6)\\nwhere F is the CO2 or CH4 or N2O emissions (mg m−2 h−1), dc dt−1 is the slope of the linear regression of gas concentration at the time approaching zero, M is the mole mass of CO2 or CH4 or N2O gas (g mol−1), P is the atmospheric pressure (Pa), T is the absolute temperature inside the chamber (K) during sampling; Vo, Po, and To are volume (mL), pressure (Pa), and absolute temperature (K), respectively, under standard conditions, and H is chamber height above the soil surface (m).\\n\\nThe cumulative fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions were measured as mentioned by Li et al. (2013).\\n(7)\\nwhere CE is the cumulative emission (kg ha−1), Fi and Fi+1 are the measured emissions of two consecutive sampling days (mg m−2 h−1), and d is the number of days between two sampling days.\\n\\nTo estimate the climatic impact of wheat under different irrigation treatments the GWP of CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions (kg CO2-eq ha−1) was used. On a 100-year time scale the GWP coefficient is 1 for CO2, 28 for CH4, and 265 for N2O emissions (IPCC, 2013). The combined GWP for CO2, CH4, and N2O for 100 years was measured by the following equation (Kumar et al., 2016).\\n(8)\\n\\nThe GWPI was measured as GWP divided by grain yield as calculated by the following equation (Shang et al., 2011).\\n(9)\\n\\n2.6. Determination of optimum irrigation scheduling and irrigation method using TOPSIS\\nTo determine the optimum irrigation scheduling and irrigation method, which offsets the negative effect to GWP and GWPI with positive benefit to grain yield, WPc and EWPc a technique of multi-objective optimization known as the “Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution” TOPSIS (Lai and Hwang, 1994) was used. The method was as follows:\\n1)\\nCreate the first contribution matrix X\\u2009=\\u2009(Xij)n × m of the evaluation indices (in this case grain yield, WPc, EWPc, GWP, and GWPI), where n is the number of evaluation objectives (in this case, five), and m is the number of irrigation treatments (in this case, nine), and Xij is the value of the ith irrigation treatments contribution to the jth evaluation index.\\n\\n2)\\nNormalization of initial contribution matrix to obtain the unified magnitude order and evaluation scale.\\n(10)\\n̅\\n\\n3)\\nCalculating the weighted normalized matrix (11):\\n(11)\\n̅\\n\\nPoistive Vij is the ideal best while negative Vij is the ideal worst case. Wj is the weight of the jth criterion such that \\n=\\u20091, in this study, yield, WPc, EWPc, GWP, and GWPI was set to be 0.20 to balance their respective contributions.\\n\\n4)\\nDifferent combinations of wheat yield, WPc, EWPc, GWP, and GWPI was used to measure the optimal solution Di+ and worst solution Di-. The Euclidean distance between each treatment and optimal solution and worst solution were measured using (12), (13).\\n(12)\\n(13)\\n\\n5)\\nTo measure the optimal solution of each irrigation treatment Ci value derived using Eq. (14).\\n\\n(14)\\n\\nA higher Ci value means a better evaluation result.\\n\\n2.7. Statistical analysis and evaluation\\nOne-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Duncan’s Multiple New Range Test (DMRT) was used to analyze the differences of the GHG emission, grain yield, final biomass, HI, WPc, EWPc, GWP, and GWPI from all treatments at a significance level of 5% (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) using SPSS 24.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, III, USA) software package. Two-way ANOVA was carried out to measure the impact of irrigation scheduling, irrigation methods, and interaction of irrigation scheduling and irrigation methods at a significance level of p\\u2009<\\u20090.05. TOPSIS technique was used to analyze the multi-objective decision making.\\n\\n3. Results\\nFollowing results provide the effects of irrigation scheduling, irrigation methods, and the interaction of irrigation scheduling and irrigation methods on GHG emissions, grain yield, final biomass, HI, WPc, EWPc, GWP, and GWPI. Moreover, comprehensive evaluation technique provides insight of suitable irrigation method and irrigation scheduling that enhanced the grain yield, WP indicators, and lower GWP indices.\\n\\n3.1. Effect of irrigation scheduling and irrigation methods on GHG emissions\\nThe cumulative CO2 emissions showed clear seasonal trend with higher emissions after fertilization and irrigation or rainfall events (Fig. 2). The cumulative soil CO2 emissions ranged from 55.45\\u2009±\\u20091.4 (D50) to 998.91\\u2009±\\u20098.31\\u2009t CO2 ha-1 (F70) in 2017, 30.28\\u2009±\\u20091.93 (F50) to 1130.92\\u2009±\\u20095.14\\u2009t CO2 ha-1 (F70) in 2018, and 44.17\\u2009±\\u20090.67 (D50) to 1255.48\\u2009±\\u200925.19\\u2009t CO2 ha-1 (F70) in 2019. Moreover, cumulative CO2 emissions showed a general trend of steadily rising cumulative CO2 emissions in all treatments. Soil cumulative CO2 fluxes were substantially (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) lower at 50% FC (Fig. 2a, d, g) compared with 60% FC (Fig. 2b, e, h) and 70% FC (Fig. 2c, f, i) in the entire study. While compared with sprinkler irrigation (S50, S60, and S70) and flood irrigation (F50, F60, and F70), drip irrigation (D50, D60, and D70) had substantially (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) lower cumulative CO2 fluxes. At all irrigation scheduling levels, flood irrigation had substantially (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) higher cumulative CO2 emissions compared with sprinkler and drip irrigation in the entire study (excluding flood irrigation at 50% FC in 2018) (Fig. 2d).\\n\\nFig. 2\\nDownload : Download high-res image (492KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 2. Cumulative CO2 emission (t CO2 ha-1) measured in the wheat season in 2016–2017 (a–c), 2017–2018 (d–f) and 2018–2019 (g–i) for different treatments. Note: S50, D50, and F50 represent sprinkler, drip, and flood irrigation at 50% FC, respectively. S60, D60, and F60 represent sprinkler, drip, and flood irrigation at 60% FC, respectively. S70, D70, and F70 represent sprinkler, drip, and flood irrigation at 70% FC, respectively. The vertical bars denote standard error. P indicate rainfall. Star, diamond, and circular arrows denotes dates of sprinkler, drip, and flood irrigation, respectively. The solid arrow indicates the day of fertilization.\\n\\nThe accumulated soil CO2 emissions trend followed at each irrigation scheduling level was flood >\\u2009sprinkler >\\u2009drip irrigation in the entire study (Table 2). While in 2018 at 50% FC irrigation scheduling the trend was sprinkler >\\u2009flood >\\u2009drip irrigation. Cumulative CO2 emissions were significantly (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) different among sprinkler, drip, and flood irrigation at each irrigation scheduling level. During the 2017–2019 growing seasons, the cumulative CO2 emissions in drip irrigation were substantially (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) lower 9.50–13.16%, 7.51–9.08%, and 3.42–15.01%, compared with sprinkler irrigation at 50%, 60%, and 70% FC irrigation scheduling, respectively. Likewise, compared with flood irrigation, drip irrigation notably (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) decreased cumulative CO2 emissions 8.63–23.75%, 10.05–14.75%, and 14.80–22.87% at 50%, 60%, and 70% FC irrigation scheduling, from 2017 to 2019 growing seasons, respectively. Compared with 60% FC and 70% FC irrigation scheduling, irrigation scheduling of 50% FC had approximately 7.02–33.24% and 12.57–37.09% substantially (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) lower cumulative CO2 emission in 2017 to 2019, respectively. Whereas drip irrigation compared with sprinkler and flood irrigation had substantially (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) lower cumulative CO2 emission of approximately 7.37–22.05% and 12.56–20.42% in 2017 to 2019, respectively. Variance analysis illustrated that irrigation scheduling, irrigation methods, and their correlation (except in 2017) significantly (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) influenced the cumulative soil CO2 emissions.\\n\\nTable 2.

Unreasonable irrigation will not effectively improve crop yield but will cause a waste of water resources and a decrease in water productivity. The objectives of this study were intended to investigate the variability of yield and water productivity (WP) as a function of irrigation amount, time, and frequency and to explore optimal irrigation of winter wheat for improving grain yield and water productivity over a 60-year of long-term meteorological data (1961—2020). A water-driven model, AquaCrop model, was used to reproduce crop growth and yield responses to changes in water supply, with a total of 625 irrigation scenarios of irrigation amount and time. The results showed that there has been no significant change in seasonal ET0 (reference evapotranspiration) of winter wheat over the last 60 years. Instead, seasonal precipitation during the winter wheat growing cycle displayed a decreasing trend, potentially increasing the risk of meteorological drought. Despite the crop ET has remained stable at around 370 mm for the past 60 seasons, the grain yield and WP have steadily increased as the cumulative temperature increased. In all three typical meteorological years, crop average yield and ET were considerably improved under irrigation conditions compared with that in non-irrigated (rainfed). The total irrigation amounts of 90, 120, and 150 mm with two irrigation times in the wet, normal, and dry years, respectively, could achieve higher yields as well as the WP and IWP. Consequently, the optimal irrigation schedules in the wet, normal, and dry years were determined to be first irrigation in the wintering stage with 90 mm and second irrigation in the jointing stage with 0, 30, 60 mm, respectively. This work demonstrates that the AquaCrop model has a reliable accuracy for revealing crop growth and production under water deficit conditions and provides a technical means of application for formulating optimal irrigation schedules.\\n\\nPrevious article in issueNext article in issue\\nKeywords\\nAquaCropIrrigation scheduleYieldWater productivityWinter wheat\\n1. Introduction\\nWinter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a major crop grown in the Guanzhong Plain, an important cereal production area in Shaanxi Province. The Guanzhong Plain accounts for approximately 9% of the total area and 47% of the total cultivated land of the province but produces about 89% of the total wheat grain production in the province (NBSC, 2020). In this semiarid or sub-humid area, the source of water supply for the winter wheat growth and yield is primarily dependent on available precipitation and/or irrigation. Although annual precipitation is around 650 mm, the unevenly spatial and temporal distributed precipitation results in only 230 mm (half of the required water amount) during the winter wheat growing season (October–May). Meanwhile, irrigation in this area is inadequate, as only half of the arable land can be irrigated. In 2019, the unit yield of winter wheat in this region was only 3.9 t ha-1, well below the average level of the county (5.6 t ha-1) (NBSC, 2020). Therefore, there is an urgent to improve water productivity (WP) and productivity in response to growing pressures on water resource shortage.\\n\\nSince the last century, how to allocate limited irrigation water for wheat during the growing cycle to achieve maximize yield, water productivity, or profits was a tough problem due to the variability in soil and environment (Zhang et al., 2017). In general, a high yield was often matched with a high irrigation amount and low water productivity. Deficit irrigation, one of the water-saving irrigation strategies widely used in water-scarce areas, rationally supplies irrigation during the sensitive or critical crop growth stage to achieve high yield or prevent a major no significant decline in yield production (Kang et al., 2000). Since the 2000s, extensive field experiments have been carried out all around the world to investigate wheat growth and yield response to deficit irrigation (Kang et al., 2002, Li et al., 2005, Chen et al., 2010, Tari, 2016, Thapa et al., 2019). Other studies also proposed empirical production functions of water supply (or water consumption) and crop yield, such as linear (Dar et al., 2017), quadratic (Li et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2013a), negative exponential (Cooper et al., 2020) functions. However, a common issue in these experiential studies was that the results were usually site- and season-specific, making extrapolation beyond the location and climate unreliable. Different crop responses could result from the same irrigation schedule in diverse regions, soil types, and climates (seasons).\\n\\nBased on the advance of crop water requirements mechanisms, the simulation models were developed to elucidate how crop growth and production responded to the various soil-water environments. Some studies integrated optimization methods into a simply coupling system of crop water production functions and soil water balance. For example, Shang and Mao (2006) developed a simulation–optimization model for optimal irrigation timing and proposed different irrigation scenarios for three initial soil water storage layers of 0—1 m. Wen et al. (2017) proposed a simulation-based optimization model for optimizing spring wheat irrigation scheduling under mulching conditions. Although the global optimum solution could be obtained in the simulation–optimization model by some optimization algorithms (e.g. genetic algorithms, simulated annealing algorithms), the pure crop water production functions were simplified and empirical that unlikely to be sufficiently generic (Li et al., 2018), and some of the scheduling may difficult to implement in irrigation management in practical application. For instance, Shang and Mao (2006) proposed total of five times irrigation during the winter wheat growing season of March to May in North China, which was arduous by the border irrigation.\\n\\nCrop growth models, also known as agroecosystem models, have been developed over the last few decades from single physiological growth process simulation to the whole growth process and have been updated and refined to simulate the dynamic of variables of interest under various water-fertilizer conditions, and field management practices. In the recent studies, most of well-known models have been calibrated, evaluated, and validated the performances to simulate crop growth and yield production under various soil water conditions and irrigation scenarios, e.g. DSSAT-CERES-Wheat (Attia et al., 2016, Zhou et al., 2018), SWAP (Eitzinger et al., 2004, Wang et al., 2021), AquaCrop (Iqbal et al., 2014, Toumi et al., 2016), APSIM (Chen et al., 2010, Ahmed et al., 2016), and RZWQM2 (Saseendran et al., 2015, Xu et al., 2020). In addition to the evaluation of the model by experimental data, other researchers focused on the model application for long-term simulation (Chen et al., 2010, Attia et al., 2016, Xu et al., 2020).\\n\\nDifferent crop models have essential differences in crop response to water stress. For instance, the DSSAT and RZWQM2 model interpreted water stress by two stress factors that linear related to potential transpiration and potential root water uptake (Jones et al., 2003). The SWAP model described the deterioration inducing by the water stress for crop canopy assimilation and senescence based on soil water potential (Van Dam et al., 1997). Compared with other models, the AquaCrop model is a water-driven model, which accounted for the effects of soil water deficit on various growth processes, i.e., canopy expansion, canopy senescence, stomatal conductance, and harvest index. Moreover, multiple stress functions (e.g. linear, convex, and logistic) could be selected to reproduce the response of different crops to soil water variations. Since the release of the model in 2009, hundreds of studies have been published to test, validate and apply for a variety of purposes (e.g. characterizing the crop response to water stress, developing deficit irrigation schedules, improving farm irrigation management, and assessing the potential increase in production) (Vanuytrecht et al., 2014).\\n\\nNumerous studies have been conducted over the last few decades to evaluate and validate the performance of the AquaCrop for simulating crop growth and production, soil moisture variability around the world. Andarzian et al. (2011) validated the AquaCrop model to simulate wheat under deficit water conditions in a hot dry environment and suggested applying four irrigations (200 mm) for wet and normal years and six irrigations (300 mm) for dry years. Wang et al. (2013b) evaluated the AquaCrop model for simulating winter wheat under five irrigation treatments on China’s Loess Plateau, who reported two irrigations on over-wintering and turning green stags could save water without reducing yields. Iqbal et al. (2014) tested and validated the ability of AquaCrop model to simulate wheat growth and production by both field experiments and long-term measured and demonstrated the model has a reliable accuracy. Furthermore, Toumi et al. (2016) not only evaluated the performance of AquaCrop modelling for different irrigations but proposed the threshold of the root zone water depletion of 0.6 could improve the wheat irrigation management. However, most of the studies only investigated the performances of a few pre-specified alternative irrigation scenarios and one of the best scenario (targeting higher yield, WP, or profits) was recommended as the optimal in the previous studies. Therefore, it was unclear if any other irrigation schedule that was not user-defined scenarios could achieve better results, or if the recommended irrigation schedule could perform consistent performance across the different meteorological seasons.\\n\\nTherefore, to explore optimal irrigation of winter wheat for improving grain yield and water productivity, the full permutations of irrigation amount and time with a total of 625 irrigation scenarios were comprehensively analyzed in this study. The AquaCrop model (Steduto et al., 2009), a famous water-driven crop simulation model developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, was used to reproduce crop growth and yield production. Furthermore, the 60 years of long-term meteorological data (1961—2020) covering the study area were also employed. The main objectives of this study were to: (1) analyze the dynamic of climate (i.e., temperature, precipitation, reference evapotranspiration (ET0)) and crop production (i.e., grain yield, evapotranspiration (ET), and WP) characteristics under both rainfed and irrigated conditions over the last 60 years (1961–2020); (2) investigate the variability of yield and WP as a function of irrigation amount and frequency; and (3) explore the optimal irrigation strategies considering crop yields, WP, and IWP in three typical meteorological years.\\n\\n2. Methodology\\n2.1. Study area\\nThe study focused on the Guanzhong Plain, a conventional grain-based area with an area of about 5.5 million hectares located in Northwest China (34°00’N—35°30’N, 106°30’E—110°30’E) (Fig. 1). The climate is a semiarid warm temperature and continental monsoon, with an average annual temperature of approximately 12—13 °C, and water surface evaporation of 800—1000 mm. The elevation ranges from 325 to 900 m, with an average of 500 m. The average annual precipitation in this region is 650 mm, while the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall is uneven, with about 70% of precipitation falling in the summer season (June to September). Soil texture is a moderately well-drained loamy classified as the loam and silt loam according to the Harmonized World Soil Database (http://www.fao.org/land-water/databases-and-software/hwsd/en/), containing approximately 20% clay, 45% silt, and 35% sand. The average field capacity, wilting point, bulk density, and pH are 33% cm3 cm−3, 10% cm3 cm−3, 1.41 g cm−3, and 7.8, respectively (Zhang et al., 2018).\\n\\nFig. 1\\nDownload : Download high-res image (123KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 1.

Typically, winter wheat is planted from mid-October to early-June of the following year and summer maize is sown as soon as when wheat is harvested from June to October. Normally, irrigation is not required during the maize growing season, except for extreme drought events. However, during the winter wheat growing season, effective precipitation is less than 200\\u2009mm (Less than half of the crop water demand), restricting wheat production. Moreover, more than 50% of farmland relies on rainfed mainly located in the east and most irrigated farming is distributed in the west and middle (Zhou et al., 2020).\\n\\n2.2. Field experiment\\nA deficit irrigation experiment was conducted for two consecutive years (2013–2015). Different irrigation quotas and timings were designed to respond to various water stress degrees. Two irrigation levels of 80\\u2009mm and 40\\u2009mm were planned according to the winter wheat water demands (Chen et al., 2006). Three irrigation timings during winter wheat growth stages were applied. Hence, a total of eight deficit irrigation treatments were implemented, with each of three replicates (Table 1). Winter wheat was planted on 15 October 2013 and 2014, and the final harvests were on 7 June 2014 and 2 June 2015, respectively. The plot size was 4\\u2009m\\u2009×\\u20092\\u2009m with 0.4\\u2009m adjacent space, and all treatments were randomly assigned. A 1.5\\u2009m deep waterproof layer was placed between each plot to prevent soil water exchange. Besides, a mobile shelter was equipped to exclude rainfall from getting in the plots.\\n\\nTable 1.

The measurements were taken from the average of three readings across the plot. The canopy cover was calculated from the LAI using an empirical equation provided by Nielsen et al. (2012). The aboveground biomass was measured after LAI measurements and the dry matter was determined by drying about 15 plants at 75\\u2009°C for 72\\u2009h. Grain was harvest at full maturity stage within 1\\u2009m2 area and the yield was taken by threshing and air-drying to constant weight.\\n\\n2.3. Model description\\nThe AquaCrop model was mainly focused on simulating the crop aboveground biomass and grain yield production as a function of water productivity (WP). Based on the previous water production function proposed by Doorenbos and Kassam (1979), the AquaCrop evolved this approach and separated the ET into crop transpiration (Tr) and soil evaporation (E) to avoid the confounding effect of nonproductive consumptive water use (E) (Eq. (1)) (Steduto et al., 2009).\\n(1)\\nwhere B is cumulative aboveground biomass production (kg m-2), WP is the water productivity (kg (m-2 mm)), and Tr is the daily crop transpiration (mm day−1).\\n\\nSimilar to other crop models, the AquaCrop model assembled a soil–plant–atmosphere continuum (SPAC) for water interaction in daily steps by coupling three basic modules of soil water budget, crop growth, and atmosphere components (Araya et al., 2010). Additionally, some management practices, such as irrigation, fertility, and weeds, that impact on crop development and grain production were also referred. The main processes of crop development and grain production were as follow: (1) crop development. AquaCrop used canopy cover (CC) to describe crop development rather than leaf area index and to calculate crop transpiration during leaf expansion, aging and senescence. (2) crop transpiration. AquaCrop determined crop transpiration by multiplying the ET0 by a crop coefficient. The ET0 could be calculated by the FAO Penman-Monteith equation using several weather variables. The crop coefficient was proportional to CC and adjusted with crop canopy development. (3) aboveground biomass. The biomass was accumulated as a function of crop transpiration and water productivity (Eq. (1)). The normalized water productivity (WP*), related to atmospheric evaporative demand and air CO2 concentrations, was used to make the model valid for different climates including future climate scenarios (e.g. Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP)) (Hsiao et al., 2009). In AquaCrop, the WP*\\u2009was set to a constant of 15–20\\u2009g\\u2009m−2 for C3 crops like cereal wheat (Raes et al., 2009c). (4) grain yield formation. The yield was partitioned from biomass by means of the Harvest Index (HI). The HI in AquaCrop is not a constant but gradually linear increase to the reference Harvest Index (HIo) (cultivar specific) starting from flowering to maturity.\\n\\nAs mentioned above, AquaCrop is a water-driven model that specifically describes the effects of soil water changes on crop growth. With the exception of temperature, fertility, and salinity stresses, five water stress coefficients were incorporated into the model to update transpiration, canopy expansion, harvest index, and root expansion, etc. Further detailed descriptions of model mechanism and application were reported by (Hsiao et al., 2009, Raes et al., 2009b, Steduto et al., 2009).\\n\\n2.4. Input data and parameters determination\\nThe input data of the AquaCrop model version 6.1 could be divided into two groups, driving variables and parameters, including meteorological data, crop data, management data, and soil data. The descriptions and definitions were as follows:\\n\\n2.4.1. Weather data\\nThe meteorological data was used to drive the model interacting with crop and soil. Five kinds of variables of air temperature (maximum and minimum), relative humidity, wind speed, rainfall, and sunshine hours/radiation were minimum inputs into the AquaCrop model. The daily ET0 was calculated from these factors by ET0 calculation, an integrated module based on the FAO Penman-Monteith method (Allen et al., 1998). A long-term historical meteorological data (1961—2020) covering the study area was gained from the China Meteorological Data Service Center (http://data.cma.cn).\\n\\nDifferent climatic conditions have significant effects on crop growth. As a result, three typical meteorological years (hydrological year/ precipitation year) of the wet, normal, and dry years were considered in this study. The method of drought index (DI) (Guo et al., 2012) was used as Eq. (2) to evaluate variations of precipitation among different years:\\n(2)\\nwhere P is the precipitation (mm), M is the average precipitation of years 1961—2020 (mm), and σ is the standard error for precipitation. DI differentiated typical meteorological years as the wet (DI > 0.35), normal (− 0.35\\u2009≤ DI ≤ 0.35), and dry (DI < − 0.35) years.\\n\\nTo eliminate the influence of the precipitation data outside the winter wheat growth stage, the precipitation data during the winter wheat growth season (from October to May of the following year) was used in calculating DI. Finally, 19 wet years, 19 normal years, and 21 dry years were achieved with the average values of 305\\u2009mm, 235\\u2009mm, and 177\\u2009mm, respectively. The monthly precipitation and corresponding mean air temperature in three typical meteorological years during winter wheat growing seasons were depicted in Fig. 2.\\n\\nFig. 2\\nDownload : Download high-res image (266KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 2.

The line and square within the box represent medium and mean values, respectively. (Similarly hereinafter).\\n\\n2.4.2. Crop characteristics\\nCrop parameters in the AquaCrop model were classified as conservative, cultivar specific, and non-conservative crop parameters (Raes et al., 2009a). Conservative crop parameters, such as the temperature or stress threshold and normalized biomass water productivity, did not change substantially with time, management practices, geographic location, or climate. Whereas, the cultivar specific and non-conservative parameters may need to be adjusted depending on cultivars, environmental conditions, and planting methods. During the decade, numerous studies have been worked to calibrate and validate AquaCrop model in the Guanzhong Plain region under various application conditions, such as irrigation (Teng et al., 2015, Silvestro et al., 2017b), remote sensing (Jin et al., 2017, Silvestro et al., 2017a), and mulching (Liu et al., 2017). Given that prior knowledge were achieved in most studies covering this study region and corroborated reliability of model parameterization. Related parameters were referenced directly and the calibration process would not be repeated. Winter wheat parameters determination and sources were presented in Table 2.\\n\\nTable 2.

Management practices\\nThe management data was an essential part in simulating field practices and events, which mainly included field management and irrigation management. In respect of the field management, the events of fertilizer, film mulching, weed infestation, and field runoff were involved. In this study, the soil fertility was treated as adequate that non-limiting for crop canopy, water productivity, and biomass production. Moreover, no film mulch was applied for winter wheat planting. The surface runoff was prevented effectively by soil bunds of 0.3\\u2009m height and excess water from irrigation and rainfall was assumed to be stored in soil layers. Weed was inevitable on farmland and applying herbicides to control weed was common practice. Hence, the level of weed management was put at ‘very good’, ranked second after ‘perfect’, and corresponding parameters (e.g. relative cover and weed stress degree) followed default.\\n\\nIrrigation management includes irrigation methods and irrigation events. Border irrigation, one of the surface irrigation techniques widely applied in this area, was employed in this study. Two important variables of application time and amount need to be determined in each irrigation event to develop a schedule. Lots of studies have been conducted in wheat physiology and ecology to investigate critical water requirement growth stage and reveal the growth response to water stress and reported controversial results for different critical water requirement stages, e.g. seeding stage (Yao et al., 2015), jointing stage (Zheng et al., 2016), anthesis stage (Li et al., 2005), and filling stage (Attia et al., 2016). Therefore, the critical water demand period of the entire winter wheat growing seasons was attributed to four phenological stages as over-wintering (Nov.—Feb.), Reviving green (Feb.—Mar.), Stem jointing (Mar.—Apr.), and Grain filling (May.). Based on the precipitation data during winter wheat growing in 60 years, the maximum and minimum precipitation were about 450\\u2009mm and 140\\u2009mm. respectively. The seasonal water demand of winter wheat was approximately 400—450\\u2009mm (Chen et al., 2006), which meant additional irrigation was unnecessary when precipitation was abundant, but much more water needed to be supplemented with a rainfall scarcity condition. Therefore, various irrigation amount gradients of 0\\u2009mm, 30\\u2009mm, 60\\u2009mm, 90\\u2009mm, and 120\\u2009mm were designed and arranged. Finally, a total of 625 irrigation scenarios have been produced to different soil water status (Table 3).\\n\\nTable 3.

Soil characteristics\\nThe two parts of groundwater and soil profile in the soil module should be filled in. The depth of groundwater in the study area was up to 20\\u2009m, which difficult to supply groundwater to crop growth by soil capillary pressure. Thus, groundwater was negated in this study. For soil profile, several soil characteristics, such as soil texture, thickness, and retention properties, were determined. According to the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD), two soil types of loam and silt loam were distributed in Guanzhong Plain. In the HWSD, soil was divided into topsoil layer with 0—30\\u2009cm depth and subsoil layer with 30—100\\u2009cm depth. Consequently, the same soil layers were arranged in AquaCrop model. The soil properties for inputting in the model were shown in Table 4.\\n\\nTable 4.

Model application\\nFollowing the preparation of all input variables and parameters, a packaged project file was created to simulate winter wheat growth and grain production using historical meteorological data spanning the years 1961–2020. The AquaCrop plug-in program was used for iterative runs of 625 irrigation scenarios. Other indicators in addition to the crop grain yield, such as the WP and irrigation water productivity (IWP), describing the ratio of water use of crop metabolism to water lost, were considered and evaluated to explore and determine the reasonable irrigation schedule. In crop production, the WP is defined as crop grain yield per unit water consumption as Eq. (3). The IWP is defined as the quantity of yield produced by one cubic meter of water supplied, which is also called irrigation water productivity reported by Molden (1997) (Eq. (4)). Furthermore, the maximum profits of crop production under different irrigation schedules were discussed. In the study area, a policy of tiered pricing mechanism for water use was implied strictly, indicating that the more water irrigation, the higher unit price paid (Eq. (5)).\\n(3)\\n(4)\\n(5)\\nwhere Gy, ET and I refer to winter wheat grain yield (kg ha-1), crop evapotranspiration (mm), and total irrigation amount (mm), respectively. Gp is grain price (yuan kg-1), Ip,1 and Ip,2 are basic water price and progressive water pricing, respectively.\\n\\n3. Results and discussion\\n3.1. Model performance evaluation\\nFig. 3 shows the simulated and measured canopy cover under eight deficit irrigation treatments during two winter wheat growing seasons. Results indicated that the simulated canopy cover had good agreement with the measured value in most cases in both growing seasons, with RMSE ranging from 4.9% to 10.4% and from 1.9% to 4.8%, respectively. Wheat canopy covers during the second year (average RMSE: 7.7%, RRMSE: 10.7%) were better simulated than that of the first year (average RMSE: 4.1%, RRMSE: 5.1%). Besides, the simulation accuracy for all 80\\u2009mm irrigation quota treatments (2013–2014, average RMSE: 7.4%, RRMSE: 9.9%; 2014–2015, average RMSE: 3.6%, RRMSE: 4.4%) was slightly higher than that of 40\\u2009mm irrigation quota treatments (2013–2014, average RMSE: 8.0%, RRMSE: 11.5%; 2014–2015, average RMSE: 4.5%, RRMSE: 5.7%) in two growing seasons. This expression was consistent with other studies reports that the performance of models would be decreased with the aggravation of water stress (Fang et al., 2010, Zhang et al., 2019a). The large discrepancies were mainly presented before around 180 DAP and well followed in the late stages. Overall, the global simulated accuracy by AquaCrop model referencing from previous studies in this region presented acceptable compared with the reports by others (Wang et al., 2013b, Toumi et al., 2016, Ran et al., 2017).\\n\\nFig. 3\\nDownload : Download high-res image (392KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 3.

However, crop yield reductions inevitably occur under uncontrolled irrigation with saline waters, especially in areas with shallow and saline groundwater. It is essential to quantify the movement of soil water and salts in a soil-plant system and to optimize irrigation patterns with brackish water to alleviate the harm of salt stress on crop growth. Therefore, a two-year cornfield experiment was carried out during 2020–2021 to evaluate differences in soil water and salt movement under different irrigation regimes: a) brackish water irrigation with high (HB), medium (MB), and low (LB) irrigation depths, and b) freshwater irrigation with medium irrigation depths (MF). Moreover, the HYDRUS (2D/3D) model was used to evaluate soil water contents (SWC), electrical conductivities of the saturation paste extract (ECe), and fluxes, distributions, and mass balances of soil water and salts for the HB, MB, LB, and MF regimes. Meanwhile, oxygen isotope (18O) was used to calibrate and verify the simulation accuracy of the HYDRUS (2D/3D) model by determining the proportion of water and salt sources in a soil-plant system.The results showed that HYDRUS (2D/3D) could precisely capture SWC and ECe under different irrigation treatments, with the root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.004–0.017 cm3 cm−3 and 0.023–0.372 dS m−1 for SWC and ECe, respectively. The highest differences in SWCs and ECe in plots under brackish water and freshwater irrigations occurred in the 0–20 cm soil layer. The stress areas in the soil profile due to water and salt stresses under MB decreased and increased by 1.8 cm2 and 2010.0 cm2, respectively, compared with MF, accounting for 0.04% and 40.2% of the root zone. However, average root water uptake (RWU) in both years under MB decreased by 1.9% compared to MF. Additionally, RWU showed a nonlinear relationship with irrigation depth when brackish water was used for irrigation. The highest RWU occurred under MB, where the average RWU in both years increased by 7.7% and 12.4% compared with HB and LB, respectively. Therefore, the MB treatment could be recommended to increase crop yield and alleviate the freshwater shortage in agricultural production. Moreover, the findings of this study improve our understanding of the mechanisms of soil water and salt movement and groundwater contributions in a system under brackish water irrigation with different irrigation depths.\\n\\nGraphical Abstract\\nga1\\nDownload : Download high-res image (271KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\n\\nPrevious article in issueNext article in issue\\nKeywords\\nBrackish waterStable oxygen isotopeThe proportion of water and saltWater and salt movementCorn yieldHYDRUS\\n1. Introduction\\nThe shortage of freshwater resources represents a \"bottleneck\" for sustainable agricultural development in arid and semi-arid regions (Saco et al., 2007, Zhang et al., 2019, Ortiz and Jin, 2021). However, there is a large number of brackish water resources in most arid and semi-arid regions (Liu et al., 2022), such as in Afghanistan (Ragab and Christel, 2002), Spain (Aparicio et al., 2019), Mexico (Ozturk et al., 2018), and China (Chen et al., 2022b). For example, the Hetao irrigation district of China has about 8.9 billion m3 of brackish water. Therefore, brackish water has been widely recommended to replace freshwater as an irrigation water source to relieve the shortage of freshwater (Jabeen et al., 2022, Fakharany and Salem, 2021). However, the reduction in crop yield inevitably occurs when irrigation with brackish water is used due to the accumulation of soil salts in the crop root zone (Bonachela et al., 2022). Therefore, to alleviate a crop growth reduction due to salt stress, it is essential to quantify the movement of soil water and dissolved salts in a soil-plant system under brackish water irrigation to optimize irrigation patterns with brackish water.\\n\\nSpecific impacts of brackish water irrigation have been studied in the literature, such as on evapotranspiration (ET), crop yield, and water productivity (Cova et al., 2020, Fakharany and Salem, 2021, Lima et al., 2021). For example, ET of Hordeum vulgare in the high-salinity irrigation water (ECiw=10 dS m−1) treatment was 9.6% lower compared to the low-salinity irrigation water (ECiw=0.8 dS m−1) treatment in 2015–2016 (Ozturk et al., 2018). Wheat yield and water productivity under brackish water irrigation (ECiw=1.31 dS m−1) in the 2017–2018 season decreased by 21.1% and 18.8%, respectively, compared to canal water (i.e., freshwater) irrigation (Arshad et al., 2022). The movement of soil water and dissolved salts in the soil profile under brackish water irrigation has also been studied in the literature. For example, Selim et al. (2012) reported that the highest soil salt concentrations were recorded between 50 and 70 cm below the soil surface in the tomato field under brackish water irrigation with ECiw of 1 dS m−1. However, the impacts of groundwater salinity on the dynamics of soil water and dissolved salts in a soil-plant system were hard to quantify. This is mainly because the movement of soil water and salts in such a system under brackish water irrigation is very complex, especially in areas with shallow and saline groundwater since soil water and salts in the crop root zone are simultaneously affected by irrigation water and groundwater (Hosseini and Bailey, 2022). The dilution ratio in the crop root zone would increase after irrigation since soluble salts would be dissolved in soil water and migrate into the deeper soil (Che et al., 2022). However, the soluble salts from shallow groundwater and deep soil would also migrate to the crop root zone during non-irrigation periods due to the capillary action against the direction of the soil water potential gradient (Singh et al., 2021). Therefore, it is complicated to quantify the transport of soil water and salts in a soil-plant system under brackish water irrigation.\\n\\nMany techniques and methods can be used to accurately trace soil water and salt dynamics, including long-term monitoring utilizing a series of sensors (Bañón et al., 2019), labeling Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) (Zong et al., 2018), stable isotope tracers (Kohfahl et al., 2008), and numerical models (Shah et al., 2021). However, many sensors are needed due to soil spatial heterogeneity (Satoh and Kakiuchi, 2021). Similarly, DNA labeling is associated with high costs and complicated implementation methods (Derbyshire et al., 2022).\\n\\nOn the other hand, isotopes are natural tracers that can precisely trace sources of soil water and root water uptake (Dawson and Ehleringer, 1998, Asbjornsen et al., 2007, Wu et al., 2018, Tokarev et al., 2022). For example, Penna et al. (2020) studied water sources for corn root water uptake using the stable isotope tracer technology and indicated that water mainly came from the 0–80 cm soil layer. Xu et al. (2021) further found that about 68% of water in the spring corn stem comes from the 40–60 cm soil layer.\\n\\nHowever, the stable isotope tracer technology cannot continuously monitor the source of root water uptake and the movement of soil water and salts. Additionally, using a larger number of field monitoring points (than we did) would be highly time-consuming and costly, and the soil profile would likely be more disturbed. Numerical models provide a quick and convenient way to quantify the migrations and distributions of soil water and salts under different complex conditions. Among many other models, the HYDRUS (2D/3D) model has been widely used to capture the dynamics of soil water and salts, mainly due to its flexibility in handling various boundary conditions, the friendly graphical user interface, and the capacity to accurately reproducing field results (Chen et al., 2020; Khan et al., 2022). For instance, Ramos et al. (2011) evaluated the effects of using synthetic saline water and freshwater on soil salt movement in a corn field using the HYDRUS model and found that the soil salinity increased considerably after saline water irrigation and decreased during the rainfall period due to salt leaching. Phogat et al. (2018) quantified salinity dynamics in the root zone of almonds under sprinkler irrigation using the HYDRUS model and found that the average root zone ECe remained above the salinity tolerance threshold of almonds. Devkota et al. (2022) reported that soil salinity in the root zone of the rice-wheat and cotton-wheat systems increased by 78% and 66%, respectively, with increases in irrigation water salinity and evaporation rates based on the long-term scenarios analysis. Feng et al. (2023) used the HYDRUS model to simulate water flow and salt transport for furrow irrigation and indicated that ECe increased when ECiw was higher than 4.0 dS m−1 below the drain depth of 80 cm. Ramos et al. (2023) assessed the soil salinization risks in commercial orchards in southern Portugal using the HYDRUS model and found that salinity stress did not reach a harmful level for plants even though salts tended to accumulate in the root zone under the current climate conditions and a given irrigation water quality. Ramos et al. (2023) recommended that tailored irrigation solutions should be considered to alleviate salt stress in dry and very dry years. Zhang et al. (2022) found, using the simulation result generated by the HYDRUS (2D/3D) model, that a \"semicircular low-salt wetting zone\" was formed after brackish water irrigation.\\n\\nHowever, the HYDRUS (2D/3D) model cannot be easily used to determine the water sources for root water uptake. Using the model to determine the contributions of irrigation and groundwater to root water uptake is also challenging. Thus, the innovation of this study is the quantification of the water and salt dynamics in a soil-plant system under brackish water irrigation by a combined use of stable isotope tracers and the HYDRUS (2D/3D) model and the formulation of an optimal irrigation schedule for irrigation with brackish water.\\n\\nTherefore, the objectives of this study are: i) to calibrate and validate the HYDRUS (2D/3D) model using multiple types of data, including soil water, salts, and stable oxygen isotope; ii) to quantify the soil water and salts dynamics, fluxes, and two-dimensional distributions under different irrigation depths of brackish water; and iii) to determine the proportions and balances of soil water and salts in the soil-plant system and crop yield under brackish water irrigation with different irrigation depths.\\n\\n2. Material and methods\\n2.1. Experimental site and design\\nA field experiment was conducted at the Jiuzhuang experiment site (40°41\\'N, 107°18\\'E), Inner Mongolia, China, during the 2020–2021 seasons. The area is in the warm temperature zone, with a mean accumulation of sunshine hours of 3230 h. The mean annual precipitation from 1956 to 2020 was 139 mm. Potential evaporation measured using the standard E601B evaporation pan made of fiberglass (with a diameter of 0.6 m and a depth of 0.6 m) reached 2332 mm. The average percentages of sand, silt, and clay in the 0–100 cm soil layer were 5%, 70%, and 25%, respectively. Thus, the soil texture at the experimental site was classified as silty loam based on the USDA soil triangle (United States Department of Agriculture, 2010). The bulk density, field capacity, and wilting point within the 0–100 cm soil layer were 1.42 g cm3, 0.36 cm3 cm−3, and 0.12 cm3 cm−3, respectively. A completely random design was adopted with four irrigation treatments and three replicates. Therefore, the field was divided into 12 plots (Fig. 1). Each plot was 7.7 m wide and 20 m long, separated by a 3 m wide bar. Corn seeds (Zea mays L, cv. Junkai 918) were sown in early May (in 2020 and 2021) and harvested at the end of September. Seeds were planted 3.0 cm deep, spaced at 30 cm at 4.5 seeds m−2 into north-south oriented rows. The spacings between paired rows and between pairs of rows were 50 and 70 cm, respectively. One drip line was introduced between two corn rows. The paired rows were mulched by plastic film, and the space between pairs of rows was not mulched (i.e., bare area) (Fig. 1). Brackish groundwater with an average salinity (ECiw) of 3.7 dS m−1 was used as an irrigation source. The average groundwater table fluctuated from 126 cm to 220 cm during the entire crop-growing season.\\n\\nFig. 1\\nDownload : Download high-res image (565KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 1. The layouts of the experimental plot (a) and the planting pattern (b).\\n\\nMeanwhile, a locally recommended brackish water irrigation depth (23\\u2009mm) was adopted in this study based on the method proposed by FAO29 (Ayers and Westcot, 1976), denoted a medium irrigation depth (MB). The leaching fraction of the brackish water irrigation treatment was 0.185. The irrigation upper and lower limits under the MB treatment were 90% and 73% of field capacity, respectively, i.e., irrigation was applied when the soil water content was less than 73% of field capacity. Additionally, the recommended irrigation depth was either increased or decreased by 33.0% (7.5\\u2009mm) in the brackish groundwater irrigation treatment, leading to the HB (30\\u2009mm) and LB (15\\u2009mm) scenarios, respectively. To control the single variable, freshwater with an average salinity of 0.91 dS m−1 was adopted as a control treatment with the same irrigation depths as MB (MF). The irrigation schedules in the HB, LB, and MF treatments were the same as in MB. A total of 12 irrigation events were performed during the crop-growing seasons (Fig. 2).\\n\\nFig. 2\\nDownload : Download high-res image (282KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 2.

Measurements and calculations\\nMeteorological data, including air humidity, air temperature, rainfall, solar radiation, atmospheric pressure, and wind speed at a 2-m height, were collected at a one-hour interval using an automated meteorological station (Onset Computer Inc., U30, Hobo, USA) located at the experimental site.\\n\\nAn automatic water level data logger (Onset Computer Inc.; U20L-01, Hobo, USA) and an automatic water conductivity data logger (Onset Computer Inc.; U24–001, Hobo, USA) were installed in an observation well in each plot to monitor the groundwater level and its electrical conductivity. Data were averaged and recorded at one-day intervals and stored in a data logger.\\n\\nThe soil water content (SWC) was measured using two TIME probes (IMKO GmbH Inc.; IPH, TRIME-PICO, Germany) installed in each plot in the middle of the area under plastic film mulching and in the middle of the bare area (i.e., no mulching area) (Fig. 3) (Dalton and van Genuchten, 1986). The SWC measurements using the TIME probes were taken at soil depths of 0–20, 20–40, 40–60, 60–80, 80–100, and 100–140\\u2009cm every 5–7 days. Moreover, the gravimetric method was used to verify moisture probes once every 7–14 days.\\n\\nFig. 3\\nDownload : Download high-res image (219KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 3. A schematic representation of the modeling domain, boundary conditions, observation points, and sensor locations. The modeling domain was divided into six zones, i.e., the 0–40\\u2009cm soil layer under the mulched area (I), the 40–100\\u2009cm soil layer under the mulched area (II), the 100–140\\u2009cm soil layer under the mulched area (III), the 0–40\\u2009cm soil layer under the bare area (VI), the 40–100\\u2009cm soil layer under the bare area (V), and the 100–140\\u2009cm soil layer under the bare area (IV).\\n\\nSampling locations and intervals for measuring the electrical conductivities of the saturation paste extract (ECe) and isotope concentrations (using the gravimetric method) were the same as for SWCs. ECe was determined by the saturated paste method (Rhoades, 1993) and was measured by a standard conductance meter (Shanghai Youke Instrument and Meter Co., Ltd.; DDS-307A, CHN).\\n\\nIsotope measurements included irrigation water, soil water, rainfall, groundwater, and corn stem water. 100\\u2009mL of irrigation water and groundwater were collected to determine isotopes after irrigation. 15\\u2009g of rootless soil was placed into a ziplock bag with parafilm to prevent evaporation and used to determine the isotopes of soil water. The corn stem was collected before and after irrigation and cut into smaller segments. Then, crop samplings were placed inside a ziplock bag to determine the isotopes of corn stem. The soil and corn stem samples\\' water were extracted using a cryogenic vacuum distillation system (LI-2000, LICA United Technology Limited, China) (Ehleringer and Osmond, 1989). The isotopic measurements for irrigation water, soil water, rainfall, groundwater, and corn stem water were carried out using a water vapor isotope analyzer (PICARRO L2140-I, Picarro, Santa Clara, USA). The isotope compositions (δ2H and δ18O) were calculated as follows:\\n(1)\\n�\\n18\\nO\\n(\\n�\\n�\\n�\\n2\\nH\\n)\\n=\\n(\\n�\\nsample\\n�\\nstandard\\n−\\n1\\n)\\n×\\n1000\\nwhere 2H and 18O represented the isotopes of hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O), respectively, Rsample and Rstandard are isotope ratios of 2H or 18O of the water sample and standard water (Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water), respectively, and the analytical precision is less than 0.1‰.\\n\\nAccording to the laws of mass conservation (Trenberth, 1991) and Moore (Chien and Karamcheti, 2013), the contribution rates of different water sources can be calculated as follows:\\n(2)\\n�\\nt\\n=\\n�\\nu\\n+\\n�\\nv\\n(3)\\n�\\nt\\n�\\nt\\n=\\n�\\nu\\n�\\nu\\n+\\n�\\nv\\n�\\nv\\nwhere Q is a flow quantity (cm3 d−1), C is the isotopic composition, a subscript t refers to water mixed from two sources, and subscripts u and v refer to two different water sources, respectively.\\n\\nThe water flux ratio from sources u (Qu) and v (Qv) was determined by solving (2), (11), (12), (13), (14), (15), (16), (17), (18), (19), (20), (21), (22), (23), (24), (25), (26), (27), (28), (29), (30), (31), (32), (1), (3):\\n(4)\\n�\\nu\\n�\\nv\\n=\\n(\\n�\\nv\\n−\\n�\\nt\\n)\\n(\\n�\\nt\\n−\\n�\\nu\\n)\\n\\nSimilar to Eq.

The water stress reduction function of Feddes et al. (1978), the threshold and slope function of Maas (1990), and the compensation approach of Jarvis (1989) were adopted to represent water and salt stresses, respectively.\\n\\nThe soil hydraulic functions θ(h) and K(h) in Eq.

Initial and boundary conditions and auxiliary lines\\nA two-dimensional area 220\\u2009cm deep and 55\\u2009cm wide was defined as the modeling domain. The initial SWC and the electrical conductivity of soil water (ECsw) calculated from the measured ECe (ECsw = 2ECe) (Ayers and Westcot, 1976) were specified in the modeling domain based on their actual distributions. The initial SWC and ECe values were obtained by measurements one day before sowing.\\n\\nFour boundary conditions were defined, i.e., on the upper boundary, the bottom boundary, the left lateral boundary, and the right lateral boundary (Fig. 3). The upper boundary was divided into three parts to represent the emitter (0–2\\u2009cm away from the dripper), the mulched area (i.e., the area under plastic film mulching, 2–35\\u2009cm away from the dripper), and the bare area (no mulching area, 35–55\\u2009cm away from the dripper) (Fig. 3). The emitter and the mulched area were assigned the \"time-variable flux\" and \"no-flux\" boundary conditions, respectively. The bare area was assigned an \"atmospheric\" boundary condition. Rainfall and potential evaporation fluxes were provided for the \"atmospheric\" boundary condition. The potential transpiration flux was associated with the entire surface boundary and distributed over the root zone using the normalized distribution of root density (see Eq. 26). The bottom boundary was assigned the \"time-variable head\" boundary condition representing the shallow groundwater level. The two lateral boundaries were assigned \"no-flux\" boundary conditions. The third-type (i.e., Cauchy) boundary condition was used for salt transport at the upper and bottom boundaries.\\n\\nTwo horizontal auxiliary lines were defined in the transport domain in the 40\\u2009cm and 100\\u2009cm soil depths to capture the dynamics of soil water and salts in the soil profile. Moreover, a vertical auxiliary line was defined 40\\u2009cm away from the dripper. As a result, the modeling domain was divided into six zones, i.e., the 0–40\\u2009cm soil layer under the mulched area (I), the 40–100\\u2009cm soil layer under the mulched area (II), the 100–140\\u2009cm soil layer under the mulched area (III), the 0–40\\u2009cm soil layer under the bare area (VI), the 40–100\\u2009cm soil layer under the bare area (V), and the 100–140\\u2009cm soil layer under the bare area (IV) (Fig. 3).\\n\\n2.5. Modeling parameters\\nThe soil hydraulic parameters for different soil layers were initially estimated using the pedotransfer functions (based on the neural network method, Schaap et al., 2001) from the soil textural information and the bulk density. These parameters were then manually adjusted by comparing simulated and observed SWC and ECe values until good accuracy was achieved. The calibrated soil hydraulic parameters are summarized in Table 1.\\n\\nTable 1.

In areas like Egypt, located in an arid/semiarid region, where vegetation water requirement represents an important fraction of the total water consumption, the pressure of population growth and increasing domestic demand and other sectors for water represent other challenges for the agricultural sector. Agricultural activity in Egypt consumes from 80 to 85% of water resources. To meet these challenges, good water governance, which aims to reduce losses and increase benefits per unit of water, should be adopted. One of the most important ways to improve water use efficiency and optimize plant production is to provide crops only with the water they need based on the climate-plant-soil relationship.There are many ways to increase water use efficiency, such as improving irrigation canals in old land to increase the conveyance efficiency; using a pressurized irrigation system in new reclaimed lands, in addition to water management practices on farm like laser land leveling; using the raised bed irrigation method, irrigation scheduling, intercropping, crop intensification, and mulching; using soil amendments and organic fertilizers; and using short and drought tolerance varieties. The integrated management for soil, water, and crops is very important to maximize crop yield and water productivity, so in this chapter, the author will provide an overview on how to maximize crop yield with minimal water use.KeywordsEgyptIrrigation efficiencyWater managementWater requirements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccess provided by University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\\n                    \\n                            \\nDownload chapter PDF\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1 IntroductionDue to the growing and more affluent population, over the coming decades, the agricultural product demand will increase rapidly, with serious implications for the demand for agricultural water. Symptoms of the scarcity of water are increasingly apparent, threatening food production sustainability and ecosystem services. Improving water productivity will shrink the extra water requirements in agriculture [1]. Improving water productivity in rain-fed and irrigated agriculture decreases the need for extra water and is thus a critical reaction to growing water scarcity [2].Egypt is located in North Africa in an arid and semiarid region. Water resources are limited, and the Nile River is the main source of freshwater. Egypt’s population is growing rapidly, so the per capita water availability is continually decreasing. However, food production and industrial activities and productions should increase; therefore, water demand is expected to continuously increase for agriculture, industrial, and domestic sectors. Egypt is one of the most vulnerable countries to the impact of projected climate change [3]. This will cause more pressure on water resources to meet expected increases in crop water requirements, in addition to the new areas of agricultural production that is expected to continue to grow. Implications could include a reduction in crop yields. All of these challenges lead scientists and policymakers to search about how to maximize irrigation efficiency.Agriculture plays a vital role in Egypt’s economy contributing to about 15% of the gross domestic product and employing about 30% of the national workforce [4]. Over 95% of Egyptian agricultural land lies within the Nile Valley and Delta. There are three cropping seasons in Egypt, the summer season (April to October) and late summer season (July until October) and the winter season commencing from November to May. The main summer crops are cotton, maize, and rice, and the dominant winter crops are wheat, sugar beet, berseem (Egyptian clover), and broad beans. In addition, vegetable crops such as potato, tomato, and others are cultivated in all seasons. Sugarcane is growing mainly in Upper Egypt, while rice cultivates in the North Nile Delta. There are several areas in the West and East Delta which grow fruits and medical and aromatic plants.2 Water Resources and Usage in Egypt2.1 Water ResourcesWater resources in Egypt are limited as follows [5]:\\n\\nNile River is the main source of water in Egypt. The Nile water comes from outside Egypt’s borders; Egypt’s per share according to the Nile water agreement with Sudan allocates 55.5\\xa0billion cubic meters (BCM)/year to Egypt.\\n\\n\\nRainfall in Egypt happens only in the winter season as scattered showers. The effectively annual average amount of rainfall water is estimated to be 1.3 BCM/year. Due to the high temporal and spatial variability of the rainfall, this amount cannot be considered a reliable source of water.\\n\\n\\nGroundwater exists in the Sinai and the Western Desert aquifers that are generally deep and nonrenewable. The total amount of groundwater has been estimated to be about 40,000\\xa0BCM. However, the current extraction is estimated to be only 2.0\\xa0BCM/year. This may be due to the great depth of these aquifers up to 1,500\\xa0m and degradation of water quality at increasing depths.\\n\\n\\nShallow groundwater in the Nile aquifer cannot be considered as a distinct source of water. Seepage losses from irrigation and drainage canals and the Nile and percolation losses from irrigated lands are the source of recharging this aquifer. This water must not be added to Egypt’s water resources. Therefore, it is considered as a reservoir in the Nile River system with a huge capacity but rechargeable live storage of only 7.5\\xa0BCM/year. The current suction from this aquifer was estimated at 6.5\\xa0BCM in 2013.\\n\\n\\nDesalination of seawater in Egypt has been given little priority as a water resource due to the high cost of the treatment compared to other sources. There are several desalination practices on the coast of the Red Sea area to supply resorts and tourist villages with adequate clean water. Other desalination units of groundwater have been constructed at numerous locations in Sinai as a water source for Bedouins.\\n\\n\\nTreated domestic sewage is being reused as a source of irrigation with or without mixed freshwater. The total quantity of reused treated wastewater in Egypt was estimated to be 0.3\\xa0BCM in 2013.\\n\\n\\nReuse of nonconventional water sources such as treated sewage water and agricultural drainage water cannot be added to Egypt’s freshwater resources. Using these sources is a recycling process of the fresh Nile water which has been previously used. The total amount of reused water was about 13\\xa0BCM in 2013. The reuse practices increased the overall system efficiency as comparable to the efficiency of new irrigation systems.\\n\\n2.2 Sectoral Water DemandDue to a rapid increase in population and improving living standards as well as the industrialization policy encouraged by the government, water requirements in Egypt are increasing continuously. Water demand can be characterized in classes representing the major items on the demand side of the water balance according to [5] as the following:\\n\\nThe agriculture sector represents the largest consumer of water resources; it consumes more than 85% of Egypt’s per share of Nile water yearly.\\n\\n\\nMunicipal water requirements include water needs for major urban and rural villages. Municipal water demand was estimated to be 10\\xa0BCM in 2013. Municipal water production is diverted from two sources, surface water and groundwater, which represent about 83% and 17%, respectively, of total municipal water demand.\\n\\n\\nThe industrial sector is vital to social and economic progress. The water requirement for the industrial sector was 2.50\\xa0BCM/year during the year 2013.\\n\\nIn summary, there exists a 20\\xa0BCM/year gap between the availability and the demand for water. This gap is overcome by water recycling. The overall efficiency of the Nile system in Egypt is about 75%. By the year 2020, water requirements are expected to increase by 20% (15\\xa0BCM/year) [5]. The main consumer of freshwater is irrigated agriculture. Globally, irrigated land contributes to more than 40% from food production [6]. Water availability is a major challenge facing agricultural sustainable development in Egypt. Water resources in Egypt are highly limited [7]. Renewable water resources are estimated at 57.3\\xa0BCM/year, almost 97% of which originates from the Nile River [8].3 Water Scarcity in EgyptFreshwater is an increasingly limited resource [9]. As world population increases and standard of living is improved, the water need is expected to increase. Huge areas worldwide will suffer from water scarcity during the growing seasons, and natural environments may be affected [10]. The available per capita of freshwater in Egypt has fallen from 1,893\\xa0m3 in 1959 to 900–950\\xa0m3 in 2000 [11]. Further, the average per capita of the available water in Egypt reached about 710\\xa0cm3 in 2014, and it is expected to reach to about 350\\xa0cm3 by 2050 [12]. In Egypt, the water shortage amounts to 13.5\\xa0BCM/year and is expected to increase continuously. This water shortage is remunerated by using drainage reuse which subsequently declines water quality. By 2025 the water shortage is expected to be 26\\xa0BCM/year in the case of using the same current policies [13].The economic and political factors are the major driving forces to water scarcity in Egypt, in addition to the population growth, physical variables (land expansion and water resources), and social factors (quality of life, poverty, crop pattern, consumer’s behavior, and imbalanced distribution of water) [14]. Rapid population increase, increased urbanization, food security concerns, and the expected potential climate change impacts are increasing the attention given to more efficient and sustainable water management in Egypt [15]. The major challenge facing water resources in Egypt is the limited availability of supply resources. There are many challenges found on the demand side, such as water surface evaporation loss, seepage losses, evaporation losses, and infiltration losses from aquatic weeds in canals and agricultural lands, as well as imperfection in control gates, the efficiency of water distribution operation, expansion of agricultural lands such as sugarcane and rice areas, and extra pumping rates from wells and lack of extraction control in deep groundwater, use of sprinkler irrigation, damages in drip irrigation systems, low distribution efficiency in drinking water network, and weak public awareness in domestic water division [13].4 Crop Water Requirements and Irrigation Efficiencies in EgyptWater requirements for various crops depend mainly on evapotranspiration which is affected by weather parameters, management, and environmental factors. Also water requirements for the same crop differ from one place to another depending on the agro-metrological zone, irrigation system, variety, and management. Data in Tables 1, 2, and 3 represent the optimum water requirements as m3/feddan for winter, summer, and nili (late summer) crops, respectively, which are grown in the main three regions in Egypt (Delta, Middle Egypt, and Upper Egypt) under surface irrigation. Application efficiency reached 80% at farm level according to [16].Table 1 The optimum water requirements for winter crops (m3/feddan) at farm level of the main three regions in Egypt on 2016 [16]Full size tableTable 2 The optimum water requirements for summer crops (m3/feddan) at farm level of the main three regions in Egypt on 2016 [16]Full size tableTable 3 The optimum water requirements for nili crops and fruits (m3/feddan) at farm level of the main three regions in Egypt on 2016 [16]Full size table\\nIrrigation efficiency mentions to the amount of water removed from the source of the water that is used by the crop. This value is determined by water distribution characteristics, management of irrigation system, crop water use rates, and soil and weather conditions. Ideal water efficiency for crop irrigation means reducing losses in evaporation, runoff, or subsurface drainage and however increasing production [17].Utilization efficiency for water resources in Egypt is very low. Large amounts of irrigation water are being lost during water transmission from Aswan High Dam to fields. The recorded data indicated that the irrigation water at the Aswan Dam has increased by about 20% from 2000 to 2009. However, the losses during the transferring irrigation water from Aswan High Dam to fields due to evaporation and transpiration have increased by 30.90% and 35.46% in 1985 and 2005, respectively, and reached 33% in 2010. The efficiency of the field irrigation system is about 50% [18].5 Sustainable Water Use and Management to Cope with Water ScarcityIn order to secure the stability of food production globally under climate change condition [19], increasing water use efficiency in agricultural systems is very important for agricultural production, industrial and municipal purposes, and ecosystem health. Egypt can utilize the available quantity of water resources through expansion of less-water-consuming crops and reducing areas of high-water-consuming crops like rice and sugarcane, as well as enhancing the water supply system efficiency by detecting leakages, improving irrigation conveyance and distribution efficiency, and, in addition, introducing water conservation tariffs which might contain several kinds of crop or land taxes, water pricing, production charges, or subsidies for conservation of water and introducing public awareness for the society of a new water culture based on conservation principles [14]. The Egyptian national food security strategy is influenced particularly by growing cash crops on new lands, decreasing the areas of sugarcane and rice, increasing the cereal production on old lands, and giving attention to positive effects of the market-oriented economy [20].Strategies for water saving in agriculture do not only include irrigation practices, but they extend into the other areas affecting on-farm water application including cultivation methods, varieties, and benefits of land leveling [21, 22]. Other water-saving strategies include covering canals with effective reaches, the timing of land irrigation, removing aquatic weeds in water passes, and turning sugarcane areas to beet in old lands. In addition, suitable pumping rates from deep groundwater aquifers using high-efficiency irrigation systems like sprinkler and drip irrigation systems in newly reclaimed lands were suggested as proposed planning alternatives which would completely eliminate Egypt’s water shortage in 2025 [13].There are many strategies to sustain water use and management in the agriculture sector to reduce water scarcity. These strategies are related to irrigation system management, farm practices, and breeding programs.5.1 Increasing Irrigation Efficiency on Mesqa and Marwa level in Old LandsThe irrigation system in Egypt starts from the Aswan High Dam to the confluence of the two river branches Rosetta and Damietta with the Mediterranean Sea. It is a very complicated system; water passes many and through principle canals, main canals, branch canals, tertiary canals called Mesqa, and a field ditch that is called Marwa. The overall irrigation efficiency in Egypt is very low about 40–60%, due to evaporation, seepage, deep percolation, and transpiration from aquatic crops in irrigation canals. The cultivated area in Egypt is only 7.9\\xa0million feddan, about 3.3% from the total land area. This area is distributed as 9% oases and deserts, 12% new lands, and 79% old lands. The irrigation efficiency in the old land which has the main cultivated area in Egypt is about 40–60%. Thus, it is essential to improve the irrigation system and hence efficiency in the old land [23]. Several changes have the potential to reduce surface evaporation from free water, seepage, and aquatic weeds so irrigation efficiency increases such as changing earth field ditches called Mesqas to canals or pipelines, changing water abstraction from multi-point in the Mesqa to one point in the top end of the raised Mesqa, and changing the control from upstream to downstream [14].Rice yield increased by 11.4% under Mesqa improvement. This increase is due to good water availability by the equity distributing between the tail and head of the Mesqa. The irrigation water applied was decreased as mean of 15.55% and water use efficiency was increased [24]. The Irrigation Improvement Project (IIP) was one of the main irrigation projects for using modern methods in land networks and on-farm development. Land leveling/tillage and rehabilitation of main and branch canals especially Mesqas (replace earth Mesqa with pipeline) were included. This promotes cooperation between the irrigation directorate and farmers by forming water user associations in irrigation distribution management [25]. Integrated Irrigation Improvement and Management Project (IIIMP) is expected to achieve additional positive effects on water distribution, quality, quantity, equity, timeliness, and water savings by replacing earth Marwa with pipeline and other technical assistance required for establishing water boards and water user associations [26]. Under the World Bank-funded IIP from 1996 to 2006 and IIIMP, the main objective of the two projects is improving the management of irrigation and drainage in the Nile Delta of Egypt. The specific objectives of the irrigation modernization are to enhance equitable water distribution, water quality, and water use efficiency and ultimately to increase agricultural production and decrease poverty. Irrigation improvements under the IIP have taken place at the Mesqa level, Mesqa for the tertiary level of irrigation canals, while IIIMP has taken place at the Marwa level, the term Marwa is used for the infrastructure at farm levels. Modernization of the Marwas under IIIMP is ongoing currently at selected areas. Seepage losses from the Mesqas are reduced by the piping of the tertiary canals, in addition allowing for pressurized water delivery. Similar improvements have newly been made to selected Marwas under IIIMP [27].5.2 Using Pressurized Irrigation System in Newly Reclaimed LandsUsing modern irrigation system such as sprinkler and drip irrigation system in newly reclaimed lands is one of the most common strategies to cope with water scarcity in Egypt, because these systems save irrigation water and maximize efficiency. Moreover, these techniques can help overcome unsuitable soil, topography, climate, and water quality conditions. Drip irrigation is the best irrigation system when using saline water because it causes the highest irrigation application efficiency. Moreover, it causes less salt accumulation in the soil, prevention of leaf burn, and short irrigation frequency which prevents the soil from drying. Also, it helps to avoid higher peaks in salt concentration through continuous leaching of salts away from the wetted area accumulating at the wetting edges away from the active root zone [28]. Drip irrigation saves about 30–50% of irrigation water compared to surface irrigation, moreover reduces waterlogging and salinization, and achieves irrigation efficiency up to 95% [29].Irrigation application efficiency can be designed as 60%, 75%, and 90% for surface (border, basin, and furrow), sprinkler, and drip irrigation, respectively [30]. Using drip and sprinkler irrigation systems in the newly reclaimed land in the desert is required, and it is prohibited to use flood irrigation in these places because of the high permeability of these soils and low water holding capacity [14]. Sprinkler irrigation saves water, time, and financial costs and can provide additional income generation [31]. Drip irrigation could be used as a possible solution for the problems of water scarcity [32].5.3 On-Farm Water Management Practices to Maximize Water ProductivityMany agricultural practices on farm level could be applied in Egypt and could enhance productivity by implementing the following:\\n\\nLaser land leveling is a very important practice to enhance water use efficiency and rationalize irrigation water through decreasing losses such as runoff and deep percolation, especially for high-water-consuming crop such as rice and sugarcane. Land leveling prevents water logging and water stress, and also it reduces water runoff, so the application uniformity is enhanced which thus contributes to increased crop production [33]. Laser land leveling reduces deep percolation and runoff by 8% and 24%, respectively, compared to non-leveled fields in Tajikistan [34]. Land leveling has a positive influence on the reduction of water applied because it minimizes surface runoff especially of the highest-water-consuming crops like sugarcane and rice [14]. Mechanization management in soil preparation and laser leveling with transplanting could decrease irrigation water applied for rice by 29% and increase water use efficiency [35].\\n\\n\\nRaised beds is one of planting methods as another on-farm practice that is effective to save irrigation water. Raised beds were originally used in row crops, but nowadays there are many researchers that have indicated the importance of this planting method to apply on non-row crops like rice, clover (berseem), and wheat. Growing berseem on raised seed beds is a successful practice to save irrigation water by 18% and, moreover, increase fresh and dry yield from 20 to 26% and 23 to 28%, respectively, compared to the traditional growing on flat soil [36]. Raised bed planting method with deficit irrigation saved about 1,600 and 1,500\\xa0m3\\xa0water/ha and increased water productivity by 30 and 45% for maize and wheat, respectively, compared to farmers' practice with full irrigation practice [37]. Transplanting rice in bottom of beds can save a large amount of irrigation water ranging from 27 to 38% and increased irrigation water productivity by 56–66% without yield reduction or even slight yield increase [38,39,40].\\n\\n\\nAlternate furrow irrigation is one of the most applicable on-farm practices to reduce irrigation water applied and irrigation costs and increase crop yield, so it improves water productivity. Corn yield increased and irrigation efficiency improved with applied alternate furrow irrigation practice [41,42,43]. Alternative furrow irrigation technique saved about 22% and 42% from applied irrigation water compared to irrigating each furrow and basin irrigation, respectively, for cotton plants. This technique can increase water productivity without any yield reduction [44]. Alternative furrow irrigation can save about 30% compared to traditional furrow irrigation, in addition to slight increased on cotton yield [45].\\n\\n\\nAlternative root drying or partial root-zone drying can save a considerable amount of irrigation water especially for vegetables and fruit plants under drip irrigation system. This practice increased water use efficiency by 40% and increased yield by 43% per vine of wine grapes compared to traditional drip system [46]. Partial root-zone drying enhances irrigation water with respect to controls [47]. Applying alternative root drying strategies for potatoes and tomatoes could save 20–30% of irrigation water compared to fully irrigated plants. This technique increases significantly the potatoes marketable yield by 15% due to better size distribution [48].\\n\\n\\nDeficit irrigation, that is irrigated plants with amounts of water less than that required for full irrigation without any reduction in crop yield. Deficit irrigation allows for better water use efficiency compared to full irrigation, as presented experimentally for many crops [49, 50]. Also water-saving strategies can be used such as regulated deficit irrigation, that is, to irrigate in drought-sensitive stages of growth with minimum amounts of irrigation water [19].\\n\\n\\nSurge irrigation is applied as cycles of on and off from the stream which is delivered to the head of furrows. This technique saves a large amount of irrigation water and improves irrigation water productivity [51, 52]. In Egypt this technique is very important to maximize water productivity especially in heavy clay soils. On and off cycles give an appropriate chance to close soil cracks and decrease deep percolation. Surge irrigation practice reduces the irrigation water necessary during application by 14.5% and 18.6% for wheat and maize, respectively, while yield increased by 7% and 7.87% for wheat and maize, respectively [53]. Irrigation efficiency increased by 11.66% and 28.37% for the cutback and surge irrigation methods, respectively [32].\\n\\n\\nSchedule irrigation is applying a metric that identifies when to irrigate and by how much. It is very important to know the accurate crop water requirement depending on crop stages. Schedule irrigation leads to enhancing water use through decrease on on-farm water losses due to evaporation and can enhance crop yield.\\n\\n\\nNighttime irrigation is important to improve water productivity through reducing evaporation during daytime hours and produce healthy plants. Farmers should irrigate crops at night, because it reduces losses of evaporation which are carried out during sunlight and tail end losses to drainage system if there is no abstraction of freshwater during night time [14].\\n\\n\\nSupplemental irrigation is one of the important strategies that is used in arid areas through applying small amounts of irrigation water to winter crops that are normally grown under rain-fed conditions [54]. Many of the agronomic practices for improving the efficiency of water use rain-fed systems and depend on reducing water losses by runoff, soil evaporation, deep percolation, and competing weeds. Supplemental irrigation technique is used to overcome periods of low rainfall or high temperatures, and it is suggested to improve crop production [19].\\n\\n5.4 Sustainable Use of GroundwaterAccording to MWRI [5], extraction from deep groundwater aquifers in Sinai and the Western Desert is estimated to be only 2.0\\xa0BCM/year and 6.5\\xa0BCM in 2013 from shallow groundwater in the Nile aquifers.The quality of the groundwater in the Nile areas especially in North Nile Delta is expected to be affected strongly by the impact of sea level rise combined with changes of Nile River flows, which will lead to an increase in the salinity levels of the groundwater [55]. In addition, current and future human activities, especially extensive and unplanned groundwater abstraction, are resulting in degradation of the availability of groundwater resources. Serious negative socioeconomic impacts can follow as a consequence. In the Nile Delta, extensive groundwater abstraction is also a very significant factor that increases seawater intrusion, and groundwater wells which were beyond salinization zones in the past are consequently showing upcoming of saline or brackish water [56].There is a gap in information and implementation of groundwater resources development sustainability and protection of the environment in Nile Delta as a regional strategy. In addition, there is deficit knowledge about groundwater quality deterioration [57]. So, detailed studies should be applied to include all groundwater resources and data on quality deterioration in the Nile Delta aquifers, as well as hydrological studies of all groundwater resource aquifers in whole Egypt including Sinai and the Western Desert to define the available quantities and the secure yield of abstraction for sustainable use.5.5 Reuse of Drainage WaterThe importance of using nonconventional water resources like the reuse of drainage water, treated wastewater, and desalination of brackish and seawater are becoming increasingly important around the world particularly in water-scarce areas. Optimization of the use of water resources in Egypt is implemented via recycling industrial and domestic wastewater, reuse of drainage water, and desalination [14]. The reuse of agricultural drainage water in Egypt is considered as an integral addition to the water sources. Pumping stations of the government and farmers’ small diesel pumps extract water from drainage ditches and put it directly in the irrigation canals to reuse in agriculture irrigation; these actions have increased the country’s water resources by 20% [58]. Water shortage in Egypt is 13.5\\xa0BCM/year and it expected to increase continuously. This water shortage is compensated by the reuse of drainage which deteriorates the water quality [13].5.6 Modification of Cropping PatternUsing the optimum cropping pattern which achieves the maximum water return from the unit of water, it is a main factor to cope water scarcity in Egypt. Moreover it should have priority in the next years especially cropping patterns which save irrigation water. Expansion of less-water-consuming crops and reducing areas of high-water-consuming crops like rice and sugarcane is one of the encouraged strategies to cope with water scarcity in Egypt [14]. The main problem for water distribution engineers in Egypt lie in the free cropping pattern. These difficulties resulted from the randomized distribution of crop along the network canals, with their different areas [7].Planting drought- and salt-tolerant crop species as amaranth, Andean lupin, and quinoa may result in more resilient high-value cash crop products and crop rotations [19]. As water scarcity is considered a main limitation for agricultural expansion, high efficient crop patterns are recommended to minimize the consumed water amount [7].6 Breeding for High Water Use Efficiency CropsBreeding programs for the different crops always have two strategies to cope with water shortage. The first strategy is to introduce short-duration varieties especially for a high-water consumer such as rice. The Egypt’s rice program developed many rice varieties such as Giza 177 and Sakha 102 which require less water consumption. These varieties reduce the duration from seed to seed by 40\\xa0days [59]. Replacing long-duration varieties by new short-duration varieties is an encouraging way to save irrigation water in Egyptian agriculture. Rice is a great example for short-duration varieties. Maize, wheat legumes, and cotton are other examples. The reduction in the number of days means a reduction in a number of irrigations and consequently in the water quantity used [14]. Cultivating short-duration rice varieties saved about 18% of the water deliveries needed compared to long-duration rice varieties [35].The second strategy is breeding drought-tolerant plants and varieties through genetic transfer or agronomic practices. Breeding programs introduced new rice varieties that are more drought-tolerant and achieved higher yield with less water applied. Aerobic rice saves about 40% from irrigation water applied through irrigating every 12–15\\xa0days compared to the same varieties under conventional irrigation [60]. Developed types of rice withstanding drought, “Oraby 1 and 2,” consume 50% of the water when grown in furrows compared to traditional rice without any reduction of productivity [61]. The hybrid rice varieties as the Egyptian hybrid “1” and “2” produce higher yield from 14 to 16\\xa0ton/ha, while it saves more than 20% from irrigation water [62]. Stresses can be overcome from mild to medium levels by agronomic practices. This can include using different crops through increased salinity and drought tolerance according to their stress adaptation mechanisms to enhance crop productivity [19].7 Integrated Water Management for Sustainable AgricultureThe integrated water management for sust\", 'unique_identifier': 168}\n",

We hypothesize that scaling relations may also\\nexist for water-related urban indicators such as the water footprint. The water footprint is an\\nindicator of water use that measures humans’ appropriation of freshwater resources. We\\nanalyze the scaling of the water footprint for 65 mid- to large-sized US cities using both\\nempirical estimates and a social interaction network model of city functioning. The network\\nmodel is used to explain the presence of any scaling exponent in the empirical estimates of\\nthe urban water footprint by linking to previous theories of urban scaling. We find that the\\nurban water footprint tends to approximately show sublinear scaling behavior with both pop-\\nulation and gross domestic product. Thus, large cities tend to be more water footprint effi-\\ncient and productive than mid-sized cities, where efficiency and productivity are quantified,\\nin a broad sense, as deviations from a linear scaling exponent. We find the sublinear scaling\\nmay be linked to changes in urban economic structure with city size, which lead to large cit-\\nies shifting water intensive economic activities to less populated regions. In addition, we find\\nthat green water contributes to the scaling both positively by transferring the dependence of\\nfood consumption on population into the water footprint and negatively by increasing hetero-\\ngeneity. Overall, the proposed scaling relations allow for the comparison of water footprint\\nefficiency and productivity of cities. Comparing these properties and identifying deviations\\nfrom the expected behavior has implications for water resources and urban sustainability.\\nIntroduction\\nFor the first time in human history, the 21th century has seen the advent of a city-dominated\\nhuman settlement pattern where the majority of people now live in cities [1]. People are mov-\\ning to cities because of opportunities, economic development, change in social structure and\\nhuman behavior [2]. By 2030, cities in developing countries are expected to double in popula-\\ntion and cities in developed countries are expected to increase by 20% [3]. It is increasingly\\nrecognized that cities are central to global sustainability because they can collectively create\\nsubstantial stress on interconnected natural resources (e.g., food and water) [4] and have gov-\\nernance structures that allow for more flexible and independent decision making [5].

In order to explore\\nthe ability of cities to achieve sustainability goals and targets, it is important to quantitatively\\nunderstand how such indicators may vary among cities.\\nRecently, it has been shown that many urban indicators and functional citywide properties\\ncan be quantified mathematically through scaling relationships. According to scaling theory,\\nseveral specific properties of cities vary on average with their size in predictable ways [7].\\nRobustness in scaling exponents has been found for a wide variety of urban indicators which\\nmakes scaling a pervasive feature of urban systems [8]. Studies have shown that there are per\\ncapita increases (superlinear scaling) in socioeconomic indicators such as Gross Domestic\\nProduct (GDP), employment, invention rate, etc., as a function of population size, indicating\\nthat larger cities are more prosperous, innovative and productive [9, 10]. In contrast, variables\\nrelated to material infrastructure, e.g., the length of electric cables and road surfaces, exhibit\\neconomies of scale as they increase slower than the city population size (sublinear scaling) [11,\\n12]. Linear scaling with population has been associated with basic human needs such as house-\\nhold consumption of water and electricity, housing, and jobs [8]. Several studies have also\\nfound that scaling relationships exist for urban environmental indicators, e.g., CO2 emissions\\n[13–16].\\nA wide variety of disciplines such as engineering [17], economics [12, 18], complex systems\\n[11, 19, 20] and geography [19, 21] have demonstrated that many characteristics of cities can\\nbe quantified and predicted mathematically due to agglomeration or scaling effects. Recently,\\nBettencourt [11] proposed a theoretical framework to predict the scaling exponents of different\\nurban quantities using the properties of social and infrastructural networks. According to his\\ntheory, the functional properties of cities are determined by the interactions of the population\\nembedded in a massive social network. These social connections, which are also part of other\\nnetworks such as transportation, electrical, communications, etc., mainly control how people,\\nthings, and information interact across urban space and time. In a different explanation of\\nurban scaling, Gomez-Lievano et al. [22] proposed that urban scaling depends on the level of\\neconomic complexity and therefore scaling phenomena will occur when all the necessary com-\\nplimentary factors are simultaneously present [20, 22]. In this study, we use Bettencourt’s\\nnetwork-based theory to analyze empirical results for the scaling of water-related urban\\nindicators.\\n“Living system” or “organism” are often used as metaphors of urban functioning since cit-\\nies, much like an organism, consume and produce resources, goods, services, and information.\\nThis view of cities is central to urban metabolism which can be defined as “the sum total of the\\ntechnical and socio-economic processes that occur in cities, resulting in growth, production of\\nenergy, and elimination of waste” [23, 24]. Urban metabolism has tended to emphasize the\\ndirect flow of resources and materials through an urban system [24–26]. To expand this frame-\\nwork, in the context of water resources, water footprints can be used to consider indirect\\nflows. A water footprint is an indicator of consumptive water use that accounts for the direct\\nwater flows that enter a geographic area as physical water and the indirect water flows, also\\nknown as virtual water flows, embedded in the consumption of goods and services [27–31].\\nThe virtual or embedded water is an important component of water footprints because it pro-\\nvides information about the dependency of a geographic region on distant water resources\\n[32]. Previous studies have estimated water footprints at the national or global level [29, 30, 33,\\n34] and a few studies have also focused on regional or city level [32, 35–40]. A main focus of\\ncity-level water footprint studies has been on quantifying direct and indirect water uses [41],\\nhighlighting that water can be saved at a much broader scale by targeting a city’s indirect water\\nuse such as the water consumed through commodity production and consumption [38, 39]. In\\ncontrast, our focus here is in the scaling behavior of the urban water footprint.\\nLarge cities get more for less: Water footprint efficiency across the US\\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0202301\\nAugust 20, 2018\\n2 / 17\\nCivil and Environmental Engineering at the\\nPennsylvania State University.

The scaling is analyzed using both empirical and\\ntheoretical estimates. The latter are obtained using a social network model of city functioning.\\nThe model is used to explain the presence of any scaling exponent in the urban water foot-\\nprints by linking to previous theories and mathematical relations of urban scaling. To deter-\\nmine the urban water footprints, we account for the direct and indirect water used by cities in\\nthe production and consumption of food and industrial commodities. Our motivation for\\nexamining the scaling of urban water footprints is to understand whether large cities are more\\nwater footprint efficient and to explain deviations from and the likely sources of any efficiency.\\nIn this study, we define urban water footprint efficiency broadly as deviations (sublinear or\\nsuperlinear) from linearity in the values of urban water footprint scaling exponents. In the case\\nof a sublinear scaling exponent (exponents less than 1), we denote the urban water footprint\\nscaling as “efficient” since the urban water footprint per capita decreases with increasing popu-\\nlation size, i.e., each urbanite has a lesser water footprint as the city size increases. In the case\\nof superlinear scaling (exponents greater than 1), the scaling exponent is used to denote ineffi-\\nciency since each urbanite has a greater water footprint as city size increases. This way of mea-\\nsuring urban water footprint efficiency is mainly concerned with economic-related efficiencies\\n(e.g., allocation of resources, economic specialization, comparative advantages, etc.), as\\nopposed to technological-related (e.g., drip versus spray irrigation) or policy-related (e.g.,\\nimproved reservoir operations) efficiencies. Ultimately, understanding the scaling behavior of\\nthe urban water footprint may be practically useful to devise strategies and policy intended to\\nenhance urban water sustainability, e.g., through cross city comparisons and by fostering\\ngreater water resources use accountability.\\nMaterials and methods\\nData\\nThe urban water footprint was computed using agricultural, livestock and industrial commodity\\nflows, and their corresponding virtual water contents, VWC. For the commodity flows, we used\\n2007 Freight Analysis Framework version 3 (FAF3) data [42]. The FAF3 data represents, for the\\nyear 2007, the flow of economic commodities among 123 different origin-destination regions\\nencompassing the entire geography of the US. Out of these 123 regions, 73 are metropolitan statis-\\ntical areas (MSAs). MSAs are defined by the US Census Bureau as a geographical region contain-\\ning at least one city core with population greater or equal 50,000, together with any adjacent\\ncounties that have a strong economic tie to the city core. After combining the 6 FAF3 MSAs that\\nhave boundaries overlapping multiple states, we ended up with 65 MSAs. We used these 65 MSAs\\nto compute and assess the scaling behavior of the urban water footprint. These 65 MSAs account\\nfor the largest and some of the major mid-sized US cities. Notice that to expand the number of cit-\\nies considered would require modeling the entire commodity trade network of any additional city\\nnot included in the FAF3 data. This is deemed outside the scope of the present analysis. We only\\naccounted for US cities because of data availability, i.e., the FAF3 data only includes US cities.\\nThe FAF3 data also contains commodity flows between the US and various international\\nregions, specified as import and export flows. Only export flows were included since our analy-\\nsis focuses on US cities. The FAF3 data divides the entire US product economy into 43 differ-\\nent commodity classes. Out of these 43 commodity classes, we included 6 agricultural and\\nlivestock classes (hereafter food classes) and 24 industrial classes. Only the commodity classes\\nrelated to the energy and mining sectors were left out.\\nTo transform the FAF3 commodity flows into virtual water flows, we used VWC data from\\nprevious studies [32, 33, 43]. We estimated the VWC of the different FAF3 food commodity\\nLarge cities get more for less: Water footprint efficiency across the US\\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0202301\\nAugust 20, 2018\\n3 / 17\\nclasses using VWC data for individual crops and livestock from Mekonnen and Hoekstra [33]\\nand Mubako [43], production data from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) [44], and\\nby applying the averaging approach of Dang et al. [45]. The VWC of the different industrial\\ncommodity classes were obtained from the study by Ahams et al. [32], which relied on avail-\\nable estimates of volume of water used per employee for individual industries at the US\\nnational level [46]. The VWC data for the food commodities accounts for both blue and green\\nwater. The blue water accounts for the consumptive use of water originating from ground or\\nsurface water sources [30] while the green water accounts, in this case, for the rainwater con-\\nsumed as evapotranspiration in agricultural production [33]. Using the commodity flow and\\nVWC data, the water footprint of production, WFP, and consumption, WFC, were determined\\nas follows\\nWFPi ¼\\nX\\nj\\nX\\nk\\nVWCi;kTi!j;k; and\\nð1Þ\\nWFCi ¼\\nX\\nj\\nX\\nk\\nVWCj;kTj!i;k þ Di;\\nð2Þ\\nrespectively, where i indexes different cities. In Eq (1), VWCi,k is the virtual water content of\\ncommodity k in the FAF3 city i, and Ti!j,k is the tonnage of k produced by city i and consumed\\nby FAF3 region j. Note that region j can be a city or non-city region. In Eq (2), VWCj,k is the\\nvirtual water content of commodity k in the FAF3 region j, and Tj!i,k is the tonnage of k pro-\\nduced by the FAF3 region j and consumed by city i. The term Δi in Eq (2) denotes the con-\\nsumptive use of domestic and commercial water [47, 48] by city i. These consumptive water\\nuses were obtained from the USGS as in Ahams et al. [32]. The urban water footprint, WF, of\\ncity i was determined as follows\\nWFi ¼ WFCi þ WFPi:\\nð3Þ\\nWFC involves both direct and indirect consumptive water uses, whereas WFP only consid-\\ners direct uses. Direct consumptive water uses occur within city boundaries while indirect con-\\nsumptive water uses take place outside city boundaries. Indirect consumptive water uses are\\nvirtually transferred to a city through the consumption of food and industrial commodities.\\nFor example, in the hypothetical illustration in Fig 1, the direct WFC of Atlanta city (Fig 1) is\\nequal to the water used for domestic and commercial activities as well as the water used to pro-\\nduce food and industrial commodities for self-consumption. The indirect WFC of Atlanta con-\\nsists in Fig 1 of the virtual water transferred through the consumption of food and industrial\\ncommodities produced in Pittsburg. In terms of production, WFP accounts for the direct\\nwater used to produce food and industrial commodities in Atlanta that are then consumed in\\nPittsburg (Fig 1).\\nScaling analysis\\nUrban scaling implies that urban indicators exhibit self-similarity [49]. The self-similarity of\\nan urban indicator can be expressed as follows [8]\\nYðN; tÞ ¼ YoðtÞNðtÞ\\nbexðtÞ;\\nð4Þ\\nwhere Y(N, t) is an urban indicator or citywide property that depends on the population N at\\ntime t, Yo(t) is a baseline prefactor common to all cities at time t, β is a dimensionless scaling\\nexponent, and ξ(t) are statistical fluctuations that account for deviations from the expected\\nvalue. At a fixed time, with ξ(t) being Gaussian, Eq (4) takes the following form in logarithmic\\nLarge cities get more for less: Water footprint efficiency across the US\\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0202301\\nAugust 20, 2018\\n4 / 17\\nspace\\nlnYi ¼ lnYo þ blnNi þ xi:\\nð5Þ\\nThus, in Eq (5), β is the slope and lnYo the intercept of the line implied by the regression of\\nY on N. With Y and N given by the data, the coefficients β and lnYo can be obtained by the\\nmethod of ordinary least squares minimization. The scaling exponent β is of particular interest\\nas it provides information about the behavior of the indicator Y. For instance, it has been\\nshown that when Y is urban infrastructure (e.g., the length of transportation infrastructure), β\\ntends to be sublinear, β < 1, and when Y is equal to an urban socioeconomic output (e.g.,\\nGDP), β is superlinear, β > 1. We used Eq (5), together with our water footprint estimates\\nfrom Eqs (1)–(3), to empirically assess the scaling of the urban water footprint with popula-\\ntion. In this study we performed scaling analysis with both population and GDP where popula-\\ntion data was collected from US Census [50] for the year 2007 and GDP was obtained from\\nBureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) [51].\\nFig 1.

Following from a few basic principles, the model can be used to obtain, in\\na unified and quantitative way, theoretical scaling exponents for different urban indicators and\\nfunctional properties. Our aim is to first use the model to obtain likely, theoretical scaling\\nexponents for WFC and WFP, and then compare those values against the empirical scaling\\nexponents obtained from the data. To implement the network model and derive the theoretical\\nexponents, we rely on several previous scaling and mathematical relations used to explain\\nurban indicators [11]. At the end, however, we obtain a single theoretical exponent that\\ndepends only on two variables. The derivation of this theoretical exponent is shown next.\\nTo implement the social network model, we let Y in Eq (5) be equal to the food or industrial\\ncommodities consumed or produced by a city in terms of monetary value. Y is expressed first\\nin terms of monetary value to facilitate the implementation of the model. Later, we convert Y\\nfrom units of monetary value to units of volume of water to determine the scaling exponents\\nfor WFC and WFP. The network model assumes the scaling is due to a citywide network of\\nsocial interactions set, on average, by the population density over the total area of the network,\\nN/An [11]. Furthering this analysis, we suggest that, instead of N/An, the relevant network of\\ninteractions is in this case set by Nf/An, where Nf is the fraction of population N interacting in\\nthe social network associated with food or industrial commodities. Nf/An is used because we\\nonly account for the fraction of the urban economy associated with food and industrial com-\\nmodities, as opposed to accounting for all the economic activities of a city. The interactions Nf/\\nAn are translated into urban outputs, either outputs for individual consumption or production,\\nusing the following [11]\\nY\\nNf\\n¼ J Nf\\nAn\\n;\\nð6Þ\\nwhere Y/Nf is the per individual output and J is a constant that translates the interactions per\\nindividual into urban outputs.\\nUnder short-term spatial economic equilibrium, the net socioeconomic benefit per capita,\\nY/Nf, is set equal to the transportation or mobility costs C. The costs are represented, as often\\ndone in urban and regional economics [52, 53], by the distant L such that C~L. The length, in\\nturn, can be related in a very general way to the area of the city by L~AH/D [11], where A is the\\ncity area, D sets the appropriate spatial dimension (D = 2 in this case since one is dealing with\\nan area), and H is the fractal dimension. The simplest assumption is to set H = 1 [10] which\\nmeans that individuals can fully explore the city area within the shortest distance traveled.\\nWith the previous relationships for C and L, and setting Y/Nf equal to C, we have that\\nY\\nNf\\n AH=D:\\nð7Þ\\nFor the total network area An, the following relationship is adopted [11]\\nAn \\nA\\nNf\\n \\n!1=D\\nNf;\\nð8Þ\\nwhere the term (A/Nf)1/D is obtained by setting the average distance between individuals equal\\nto the average length of infrastructure network per capita. The form of Eq (8) is motivated by\\nLarge cities get more for less: Water footprint efficiency across the US\\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0202301\\nAugust 20, 2018\\n6 / 17\\nprevious findings [8]. Using A instead of An in Eq (6) to represent the per capita output in\\nterms of city area, and combining Eqs (6) and (7), we get A~Nf\\nα, where α = D/(D+H). The scal-\\ning relationship A~Nf\\nα is substituted into Eq (8) to obtain An~Nf\\n1−δ, where δ = H/[D(D+H)].\\nLastly, substituting the latter scaling relationship into Eq (6), we obtain\\nY  Nf\\n1þd:\\nð9Þ\\nTo empirically evaluate Eq (9), Nf needs to be known but there are no datasets available that\\nrelate the urban consumption or production of food and industrial commodities to Nf. There-\\nfore, as a proxy to Nf and to gain tractability, the number of establishments Nb associated with\\neconomic sector or industry b is used, since previous results have shown that Nb~Nγ where the\\nscaling exponent γ varies with the type of industry and, more broadly, with the economic sec-\\ntor (primary, secondary, or tertiary) [12]. Thus, letting Nf~Nγ and substituting into Eq (9), one\\nhas that\\nY  Ngð1þdÞ:\\nð10Þ\\nContrasting Eqs (4) and (10), the theoretical value of the scaling exponent in Eq (10) is β = γ(1\\n+δ) or b ¼ 7\\n6 g with D = 2 and H = 1.\\nAlthough we have relied on several equations, Eqs (6)–(9), to obtain a theoretical expression\\nfor the exponent β, hereafter we only use Eq (10) to explain any empirical scaling exponents\\nfor the urban water footprint. By including the exponent γ in Eq (10), we have modified the\\noriginal theoretical exponent obtained by Bettencourt [11] to account for the effect of different\\neconomic industries on the scaling. When taking into consideration all the economic indus-\\ntries in a city, however, one expects γ = 1 [12] so that the scaling exponent of Bettencourt [11],\\nnamely 1+δ, is recovered. Since γ can vary over a wide range of values [12], from 0 to 1.2, the\\ntheoretical exponent β, in this case, may be sublinear or superlinear depending on the value of\\nγ.\\nBased on the results of Youn et al. [12], the value of γ for food commodities is likely between\\n0.9 (food services) and 1.0 (manufacturing), which implies according to Eq (10) that the theo-\\nretical value of β is approximately in the range 1.05–1.17. We found by fitting Eq (5) to the\\ndata that the empirical value of β is 1.10 (R2 = 0.84, p-value<0.001) and 1.05 (R2 = 0.63, p-\\nvalue<0.001) for urban food commodity consumption (Fig 2A) and production (Fig 2B),\\nrespectively. Thus, the theoretical and empirical values of β compare well against each other.\\nYoun et al. [12] do not report individual values of γ for the industry classes considered in the\\nFAF3 data. They, however, found the value of γ decreases from approximately 1.2 to 0 for\\nindustries in the service and primary sector, respectively, with secondary sector industries hav-\\ning values of γ in between 1 and 0. Also, the industrial commodities in the FAF3 data consist\\nof a heterogeneous mix of mostly secondary sector industries, which are less prevalent in large\\ncities and likely to engage a smaller fraction of N than the food commodities. Because of these\\nconsiderations, it is reasonable to expect for the industrial commodities that the value of β is\\nclose to or somewhat less than 1 (i.e., γ<0.85). We found the empirical values of β to be 0.86\\n(R2 = 0.89, p-value<0.001) and 0.95 (R2 = 0.70, p-value<0.001) for urban industrial commod-\\nity consumption (Fig 2A) and production (Fig 2B), respectively. These values of β imply that γ\\nis equal to 0.74 and 0.81, respectively, which corresponds with our general observation that\\nγ<0.85. Hereafter we omit reporting the p-value since it is always less than 0.001.\\nNotice that the value of β is sublinear for both urban industrial commodity consumption\\nand production. This is due to the value of γ being less than 0.85 for both cases. This differs\\nfrom the sublinear scaling associated with infrastructure efficiencies [11], which applies when\\nthe scaling variable under consideration is urban infrastructure. Thus, in this case, the value of\\nLarge cities get more for less: Water footprint efficiency across the US\\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0202301\\nAugust 20, 2018\\n7 / 17\\nβ varies depending on the economic industries considered and the change in the prevalence of\\nthose industries with urban population, i.e., the exponent γ.\\nScaling of the urban water footprint of consumption and production\\nTo link the previous theoretical exponents to the scaling exponent for WFC, we added urban\\nfood and industrial commodity consumption together to obtain the total urban commodity\\nconsumption Yc. The scaling exponent β’ in Yc~Nβ’ was obtained as the weighted average of\\nthe scaling exponents for food, β = 1.10, and industrial, β = 0.86, consumption following the\\napproach in S1 Appendix. The approach allows to approximate the scaling exponent of the\\nsum of two scaling variables [7]. β’ is employed here, as opposed to β, to indicate that the scal-\\ning exponent for Yc is approximated from two other more fundamental scaling exponents.\\nUsing the weighted average approach, we found β’ = 0.86, which compares well with the\\nempirical value of 0.87 (R2 = 0.90) estimated directly from the data. Notice that the weighted\\naverage approach allows to track the effect of β on β’ because of this, hereafter, the exponents\\nobtained in this manner are referred to as semi-theoretical.\\nTo transform Yc from units of monetary value to volume of water, we used the dependence\\nbetween Vc and Yc, where Vc denotes the virtual water flows associated with total urban com-\\nmodity consumption. By setting Δ = 0 in Eq (2), one simply has that Vc = WFC, which is a rea-\\nsonable assumption because the magnitude of virtual water flows in Eq (2) is much greater\\nthan the value of Δ [32]. The dependence between Vc and Yc can be generally described by\\nVc~Yc\\nϕ. The reason for this is that Vc is expected to scale with population because as urban\\npopulation increases so does total food consumption and, in consequence, virtual water flows.\\nVirtual water flows increase with population mainly because of green water, which rises as the\\namount of cropland consumption grows. Therefore, through the mutual dependence of Vc\\nand Yc on population, we expect the two variables to relate to each other. Indeed, we found in\\nFig 2.

Combining Yc~Nβ’ and Vc~Yc\\nϕ, and letting Vc = WFC, we\\nfound that the semi-theoretical scaling exponent for WFC~Nϕβ’ is approximately given by ϕβ’\\n= 0.88. A similar analysis was performed for WFP. We found that WFP~Nϕβ’ with β’ = 0.95\\n(using the weighted average approach), ϕ = 0.93 (R2 = 0.58), and ϕβ’ = 0.88, with the empirical\\nestimate for β’ being 0.95 (R2 = 0.71). Interestingly, the value of ϕ is relatively close to 1 for\\nboth WFC and WFP, thus having only a mild effect on the scaling. Table 1 summarizes the\\nrelationships and exponents used to obtain the scaling exponents for WFC and WFP.\\nThe semi-theoretical scaling exponent ϕβ’ for WFC and WFP, which is equal to 0.88 in both\\ncases, is relatively close to the empirical estimates of 0.92 (Fig 3A) and 0.91 (Fig 3B), respec-\\ntively. Thus, both WFC and WFP exhibit slightly sublinear scaling with population, indicating\\nthat large cities tend to be more water footrpint efficient than mid-sized cities, based on our\\ndefinition of water footprint efficiency, β<1.

This is not surprising since the inter-\\nnal economic structure of cities varies from city to city as they specialize in different economic\\nsectors, and some cities (e.g., New Orleans has an unusually high WFP value) may be specializ-\\ning in more water intensive activities. In addition, WFC has much higher values than those of\\nWFP. For example, Los Angeles has a WFC value of 9.8 x 1010 m3/year (Fig 3A), which is more\\nthan twice its WFP value (Fig 3B).

Sub-SaharanAfrica comprises 43 % arid and semi-arid area, which is projected to increasedue to climate change. Small-scale, rainfed agriculture is the main livelihoodsource in arid and semi-arid areas of SSA. Because rainfed agriculture constitutesmore than 95 % of agricultural land use, water scarcity is a major limitation toproduction. Crop production, speciﬁcally staple cereal crop production, will haveto adapt to water scarcity and improved water productivity (output per waterinput) to meet food requirements. We propose inclusion and promotion ofdrought-tolerant cereal crops in arid and semi-arid agro-ecological zones of SSAwhere water scarcity is a major limitation to cereal production. Sorghumuniquely ﬁts production in such regions, due to high and stable water-use efﬁ-ciency, drought and heat tolerance, high germplasm variability, comparativenutritional value and existing food value chain in SSA. However, sorghum issocio-economically and geographically underutilized in parts of SSA. Sorghuminclusion and/or promotion in arid and semi-arid areas of SSA, especially amongsubsistence farmers, will improve water productivity and food security.IntroductionSub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has the highest percentage offood insecurity globally (Clover 2003, FAO, IFAD andWFP 2014). Almost two of every three people in SSA live inrural areas, relying principally on small-scale, rainfed agri-culture for their livelihood (Food and Agriculture Organi-zation (FAO) 2014). In rural households, most food isproduced and consumed locally (Garrity et al. 2010), mak-ing household agricultural productivity critical to improv-ing food security (Schmidhuber and Tubiello 2007). Ruralpoverty accounts for 83 % of the total extreme poverty inSSA, and about 85 % of the poor depend on agriculture fortheir livelihoods (Byerlee et al. 2005). Small-scale rainfedagriculture is the main livelihood source in arid and semi-arid areas of SSA. The yield levels in such farming systemsare very low, especially during years of severe drought(Mavhura et al. 2015).Sub-Saharan Africa comprises 43 % of the area classiﬁedto an extent as arid (Food and Agriculture Organization(FAO) 2008). Under these conditions, water becomes thesingle most limiting factor to successful crop production.Climate change predictions for SSA suggest rainfall reduc-tion, variable distribution pattern, increased erratic rainfall,intraseasonal dry spells, and incidences of ﬂooding, hightemperatures,correspondingincreasedevaporativedemand and higher frequency of droughts (Ringler et al.2010, Schulze 2011). This causes SSA crop production tobe vulnerable because rainfed agriculture constitutes morethan 95 % of agricultural land use (Singh et al. 2011). Thiswill effectively compound the existing challenges to cropproduction and food security, hence underscoring the needfor improving effective use of water in rainfed agriculture(Blum 2009) as well as adoption of resilient crops (Headeyet al., 2012). In this context, resilient crops are those with ahigh ability to withstand or recover from water-stress peri-ods.Cereal crops are a major source of dietary energy in thediets of people in SSA (Chauvin et al. 2012). In principle,producing cereal crops is water intensive. Past and current© 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH1J Agro Crop Sci (2016) ISSN 0931-2250agricultural interventions have been focused on increasingproduction of high-energy crops in order to improve foodavailability and access. The approaches have also assumedthat improved availability would lead to stability (less pricevolatility) and guarantee sustainable access. These effortshave mainly focused on a few energy-rich cereal crops suchas maize, wheat and rice. While this has led to hugeimprovements in terms of crop production, it has alsoresulted in some of the cereal crops being cultivated in lesssuitable areas while suitable cereal crops have been rele-gated (Mabhaudhi et al. 2016a). This success has to beaccompaniedbymatchingcerealcropstosuitableagro-ecologies and maximizing on their genetic potential(Sebastian 2009); this could have greater impacts on foodsecurity. To ensure and improve food security, crop pro-duction, especially for staple food crops, should be focusedon water conservation and improved water productivity.Cereals are an important food source for human con-sumption and food security (Food and Agriculture Orga-nization (FAO) 2014), and SSA cropping systems amongrural subsistence farmers are largely cereal based. Themost widely cultivated cereal crops in SSA are maize (Zeamays L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), millet (Pennise-tum glaucum L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) (Edmondset al. 2009). Other cereals under production includewheat (Triticum spp.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), oats(Avena sativa), buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) andteff (Eragrostis tef Zucc.) (Haque et al. 1986, World Bank,2008). Of these, maize has high water requirements, whilewheat, barley and rice suffer high yield losses and cropfailure under water stress and during drought periods.MilletandsorghumareindigenouscropstoSSArenowned for their drought and heat tolerance. However,sorghum has a wider production distribution range, isproduced on a larger area and has higher yield outputthan millet. Sorghum can tolerate temporal waterlogging,which confers an advantage in ﬂooding situations. Sor-ghum’s drought, heat and waterlogging tolerance as wellas adoption by farmers make sorghum an ideal crop forproduction in SSA.Despite sorghum being the second most grown cerealcrop in SSA, the potential of sorghum’s drought toleranceto contribute to improving water productivity is relativelystill underutilized (Mabhaudhi et al. 2016b). This reviewproposes sorghum as an alternative cereal crop for cultiva-tion in SSA to enhance water productivity and improvefood security, especially in regions threatened by waterscarcity. This article reviews water use of cereal crops pro-duced in SSA and motivates for sorghum inclusion and/orpromotion in arid areas of the region. This is carried outby reviewing cereal crop production in SSA, identifyingagro-ecological zones (AEZs) and distribution thereof,identifying regions where inclusion and/or promotion ofsorghum would beneﬁt cereal production, and reviewingsorghum attributes, which make it uniquely poised as aniche crop in such regions.Water Use of CerealsDistribution of agro-ecological zones and comparativeadvantage of cerealsLand and water resources and the way they are used arecentral to the challenge of improving food security acrossthe world. Agriculture in SSA is 95 % rainfed (Singh et al.2011) with very limited use of external inputs such as fertil-izers. This means that the land’s agricultural production ofcereals depends almost solely on the agro-ecological poten-tial (Sebastian 2009). Agro-ecological zones are geographi-calareasexhibitingsimilarclimaticconditionsthatdetermine their ability to support rainfed agriculture. Sub-Saharan Africa can be divided into six AEZs, differentiatedby the length of the potential growing period for rainfedagriculture. Within these AEZs, rainfall ranges dramati-cally, from over 2000 mm year1 in central Africa to<400 mm year1 in arid areas (Bationo et al. 2006, Ringleret al. 2010). These AEZs are deserts, arid, semi-arid,humid, subhumid and highland regions. Sub-SaharanAfrica comprises 17 % arid area, 17 % semi-arid and 9 %dry subhumid, totalling 43 % of the continent classiﬁed toan extent as arid (Food and Agriculture Organization(FAO) 2008). About 60 % of SSA is vulnerable to drought,with 30 % of it considered as highly vulnerable (Mavhuraet al. 2015).Production of cereal crops in suitable AEZs with a com-parative advantage can potentially increase water produc-tivity under rainfed cropping systems. This could increasecrop yields without a corresponding increase in water use.Agriculture has seen a shift from increasing productionthrough increasing area under cultivation to focusing onwater conservation and increasing water productivity(Machethe et al. 2004, Fanadzo et al. 2010). Despite this,cereal production systems and trends in SSA remain largelyunchanged and dominated by maize production, even inarid regions. Cereal crop production increases have beendue to improvements in breeding and increased productionarea rather than improved water productivity.Cereal crop production in SSASub-Saharan Africa’s rural economy remains strongly agro-based relative to other regions (Livingston et al. 2011). Assuch, economic growth focused on agriculture has a dis-proportionately positive impact in reducing food insecu-rity. In SSA, cereals are a staple food for, and mostlyproduced by, resource-poor farmers. Cereals and cereal© 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH2Hadebe et al.products are an important source of energy, carbohydrate,protein and ﬁbre, as well as containing a range of micronu-trients such as vitamin E, some of the B vitamins, magne-sium and zinc (McKevith 2004). Land under cerealproduction in SSA in 2008 was 92 132 298 hectares (WorldBank, 2008). The most widely cultivated cereal crops inSSA are maize, sorghum, millet and rice, respectively(Edmonds et al. 2009). Being the largest crop produced,maize has cultural, economic and political signiﬁcance inSSA and is the dominant staple food for much of easternand southern Africa, while greater dependence on millet,rice and sorghum is found in western Africa (Doward et al.2004).Among the staple cereal crops, rice and maize have highwater requirements (Table 1); hence, the production ofcereal crops with low water requirements provides a com-parative advantage in water-scarce areas (Table 2). In largeparts of SSA, maize is the principal staple crop, covering atotal of approximately 27 Mha. Maize accounts for 30 % ofthe total area under cereal production in this region: 19 %in West Africa, 61 % in central Africa, 29 % in easternAfrica and 65 % in southern Africa (Food and AgricultureOrganization (FAO) 2010; Cairns et al. 2013). In southernAfrica, maize is particularly important, accounting for over30 % of the total calories and protein consumed (Food andAgriculture Organization (FAO) 2010). Among SSA AEZs,the subhumid zone constitutes 38 % of the total land areain SSA and has favourable rainfall (700–200 mm perannum) for maize production (Zingore 2011). Maize yieldshave stagnated and in some areas declined in SSA. One ofthe primary reasons is the lack of use of drought ameliora-tive measures (Fischer et al. 2014). This AEZ land area andrainfall is sufﬁcient for the production of maize and otherhigh water requirement cereals lacking drought and heattolerance. Rice lies fourth in area SSA area under produc-tion. In the decade, the growth of rice yield has droppedbelow 1 % per year worldwide and low yield constitutesone of the main challenges of rice production in SSA. Riceproduction is increasingly constrained by water limitationand increasing pressure to reduce water use in irrigatedproduction as a consequence of global water crisis (Zhanget al. 2012). Breeding attempts have resulted in NEw RICefor Africa (NERICA) initiative, which has led to the releaseof upland NERICA varieties with relatively less water usecompared to traditional lowland rice (Akinbile et al. 2007).However, even the NERICA varieties still have signiﬁcantlyTable 1 Growing conditions, production statistics and water-use characteristics of major cereals in SSACereal typeWater use (mm) pergrowing season1Average growingperiod (days)1Stress tolerancesWater productivity(WP) (kg m3)Water-use efﬁciency(WUE) (kg ha1 mm1)Maize500–800125–180–1.1–2.757.6–10.414Sorghum450–6503,6115–130Heat, drought, temporalwaterlogging and salinity0.6–2.7812.4–13.44Wheat450–650120–150–0.6–2.05,169.7–11.02Rice (paddy)450–9401190–150Waterlogging and ﬂooding0.6–1.654.5–10.911Barley450–650120–150–0.7–1.577.7–9.715Millet450–650105–140Heat and drought0.4–1.0125.1–10.44,10Teff450–550150–165Drought and waterlogging0.6–1.294.2–11.213WP and WUE values were quoted for grain yields where water use was above the minimum crop water requirements.

However, thesecrops are still susceptible to drought and heat stress andsuffer high yield losses under water stress. Teff, millet andsorghum have low water requirements beﬁtting rainfallranges in arid and semi-arid regions. Additionally, thesethree crops exhibit drought and heat stress tolerance. Sor-ghum and millet are highly drought tolerant, while teffexhibits a moderately sensitive and linear response to waterstress (Araya et al. 2011a). Sorghum, among the three cere-als, is particularly suited for arid and semi-arid AEZs inSSA as it is uniquely tolerant to temporal waterlogging.Temporal waterlogging tolerance is important under con-ditions of extreme, erratic rainfall which is experienced bycrops in SSA.It has previously been suggested that increasing pro-ductivity of cereals will improve food security in theregion (Romney et al. 2003). However, it is not about‘any’ but rather about improving the production of cer-eal crops that are suited to SSA’s AEZs. Cereal cropsthat have desirable water-use characteristics are currentlybeing overshadowed by the major crops in terms of pro-duction area, consumption trends and research atten-tion.This‘business-as-usual’approachtocerealproduction has resulted in declining yields for majorcrops such as maize (Fischer et al. 2014) and generalneglect of alternative cereal crops with potential to con-tribute to food security in marginal AEZs. Because wateris the predominant limiting factor in crop productionwithin SSA, a starting step would be reviewing the wateruse of the different cereal crops. This would allow ﬁttingthem into speciﬁc AEZs where each cereal crop possessesa comparative advantage.Water-use characteristics of cereal production in SSATo improve cereal yield in arid and semi-arid AEZs, it isimportant to understand their crop water use. Under rain-fed agriculture, water-use efﬁciency (WUE) of major cerealcrops becomes a key factor in increasing yield under waterscarcity (Blum 2005). Water-use efﬁciency is the yield out-put per unit evapotranspiration (soil evaporation plus croptranspiration) (Mabhaudhi et al. 2016a). To obtain WUEin cereal grain crops, the mass of the yield portion (pinna-cle, cob, head, etc.) is divided by crop water use (evapo-transpiration) from sowing to physiological maturity. Thisshould not be confused with water productivity (WP),which is the yield output per unit of water transpired bythe crop (Steduto et al. 2007). The difference betweenWUE and WP is highlighted below in the equations used tocalculate them.WUE ¼ total biomass or yield=Xevapotranspiration ð1ÞWP ¼ total biomass or yield=Xtranspiration:ð2ÞWater-use efﬁciency is a function of several factors,including crop physiological and morphological character-istics, genotype, planting population, soil characteristicssuch as soil water holding capacity, meteorological condi-tions and agronomic practices. In order to optimize yieldunder water-limiting conditions, an ideal cereal cropshould have a long and dense root structure, stay greencharacteristics, high harvest index and maintain high WUEunder stress. To improve WUE, integrative measuresshould aim to optimize cultivar selection and agronomicpractices (Azizian and Sepaskhah 2014).Among the agronomic practices for improving WUE iscrop selection. Multiple approaches have been proposed toimprove cereal production in arid and semi-arid environ-ments of SSA, for example supplementary irrigation andbreeding for drought tolerance in major crops (Edmeadeset al. 1997, Ortiz et al. 2007, Kijne et al. 2009, Cairns et al.2013). In this review, we propose production, promotionand inclusion of suitable drought-tolerant cereal crops toimprove water-use efﬁciency under arid and semi-aridAEZs of SSA. In comparison with teff and millet, sorghumhas higher WUE (Table 1). Additionally, sorghum has thehighest tonnage and number of SSA countries producing it.Lowest annual rainfall is experienced in arid and semi-aridAEZs of SSA. The situation is exacerbated by that receivedannual rainfall generally is not available throughout acrop’s growing season (Table 2). Therefore, actual rainfallreceived during a growing season is often lower thanquoted ﬁgures and also highly irregular. This makes sor-ghum production in arid and semi-arid regions of SSA aviablealternative(Table 2)forincreasingwaterproductivity in the region.Maize and sorghum have the highest upper water pro-ductivity thresholds compared with other cereals discussedin this review (Table 1). This implies that both crops havethe highest water-use potential and are preferred for pro-duction under conditions of zero or minimal soil evapora-tion. This can be attributed to relatively high yields inmaize compared with sorghum, and relatively low cropwater requirements in sorghum compared with maize.This means that maize can attain higher yields using morewater than sorghum, while sorghum attains lower yieldsusing less water than maize. High yield potential thus© 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH4Hadebe et al.gives maize comparative advantage for production in sub-humid and humid regions of SSA (Table 2). However,sorghum has higher water-use efﬁciency than maizemainly due to high tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses(Table 1). Thus, cropping sorghum is advantageous forproduction under water-limited areas and arid and semi-arid regions of SSA.Climate change and variability impacts in SSA willmainly be felt through water, that is increased frequency ofrainfall extremes such as droughts and ﬂoods (Schulze2011). Increasing rainfall variability will also expose cropsto episodes of intermittent water stress (Chivenge et al.2015). In addition, the percentage semi- and arid area ofSSA is predicted to increase, thus suggesting an increase inmarginal agricultural production areas. Therefore, we canno longer afford to side-line the production of drought-and heat stress-tolerant cereals.Impacts of climate change on cereal crop productionCereal crop production in SSA is projected (based on IFPRIIMPACT modelling) to decline by a net 3.2 % by 2050 as aresult of climate change. This will largely be due to pro-jected increased incidence of drought and temperatureswarming above global average. The largest negative yieldimpacts are projected for wheat (22 %), maize (5 %)and rice (2 %), respectively. Increasing the area undercereal crop production by 2.1 % will partially compensatefor the overall yield growth decline. On the contrary, milletand sorghum yields are projected to increase slightly underclimate change given their drought and heat stress toler-ance (Ringler et al. 2010). This highlights that the majorcereals’ (maize, rice and wheat) capacity to meet the foodrequirements of a growing population will be negativelyimpacted. As such, current research efforts for major cerealcrops are targeted at breeding drought- and heat stress-tol-erant cultivars that will be able to produce under theseconditions.On a positive note, these simulations suggest that underconditions of increasing water scarcity and high tempera-ture, millet, sorghum and other drought- and heat-tolerantcrops may become future cereal crops for production inSSA. However, current trends show that, in terms of landarea under cereal production, sorghum and millet still lagbehind maize even in arid regions of SSA. This implies thatpotential of sorghum is currently underutilized in theregion. There is a need to promote sorghum as a possiblefuture crop. In order to do this, there is need for empiricaldata describing its morphological, phenological and physi-ological characteristics that make it suited for productionin water-scarce regions. This knowledge will be importantin exploiting the potential of sorghum in arid and semi-arid regions of SSA.Sorghum Adaptation to Water StressThe effect of drought stress depends on the plant develop-mental stage at the onset of stress. Under ﬁeld conditions,drought stress can occur at any stage of crop growth rang-ing from seedling establishment, vegetative, panicle devel-opment and post-ﬂowering, and the period between grainﬁlling and physiological maturity (Rosenow and Clark1995, Rosenow et al. 1996). Sorghum is reputed for its abil-ity to tolerate water stress, both intermittent and terminalstress. This is mostly attributed to its dense and proliﬁcroot system, ability to maintain relatively high levels ofstomatal conductance, maintenance of internal tissue waterpotential through osmotic adjustment and phenologicalplasticity (Tsuji et al. 2003). Water-stress responses in sor-ghum can be of physiological, morphological and pheno-logical in nature. Sorghum genotypes differ in their degreeof drought tolerance, especially with respect to the timingof stress. Sorghum genotypes that exhibit good toleranceduring one developmental stage may be susceptible todrought during other growth stages (Akram et al. 2011).Such genotypic variation with respect to responses to waterstress allows for farmers to select varieties which best suitlocal farming conditions and hence making sorghum suit-able to a range of conditions.Physiological adaptationAbility to maintain key physiological processes, such asphotosynthesis, during drought stress is indicative of thepotential to sustain productivity under water deﬁcit. Sor-ghum exhibits physiological responses that allow a contin-ued growth under water stress (Dugas et al. 2011). Delayedsenescence, high chlorophyll content and chlorophyll ﬂuo-rescence as well as low canopy temperature and high tran-spiration efﬁciency are physiological traits that conferdrought tolerance to sorghum (Harris et al. 2006, Kapani-gowda et al. 2013). From a crop improvement perspective,manipulating these traits can increase drought tolerance insorghum.Crop species reduce photosynthesis through the modiﬁ-cation of photosynthetic apparatus under water stress.Reduction in chlorophyll content forms part of that modi-ﬁcation (Kapanigowda et al. 2013) to water stress. Chloro-phyll content is genotype dependent and varies accordingto plant stage (Van Oosterom et al. 2010, Wang et al.2014). Delayed senescence or ‘stay green’ is the ability ofthe plant to retain greenness during grain ﬁlling underwater-limited conditions (Borrell et al. 2014). Delayed leafsenescence in sorghum allows the continued photosynthe-sis under drought conditions, which can result in normalgrain ﬁll and larger yields compared with senescent culti-vars (Tolk et al. 2013).© 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH5Cereal Water Use: A Focus on SorghumStomatal conductance mediates the exchanges of watervapour and carbon dioxide between leaves and the atmo-sphere. Sensitivity of sorghum stomatal conductance to soilwateravailabilityandvapourpressuredeﬁcitvariesbetween genotypes. Sorghum partially closes stomata, rollsleaves and has a narrow leaf angle in response to water andheat stress, effectively reducing transpiration and exposurearea to solar radiation. Under intermittent water stress,partial closure of stomata is used to sustain reduced photo-synthetic activity, which ultimately results in high andstable WUE in sorghum compared with other drought-sus-ceptible cereals (Takele and Farrant 2013).Osmotic adjustment is conservation of cellular watercontent. In sorghum, osmotic adjustment is associated withsustained biomass yield under water-limited conditionsacross different cultivars (Blum 2005). Osmotic adjustmenthelps maintain higher leaf relative water content at low leafwater potential under water stress; this sustains growthwhile the plant is meeting transpirational demand byreducing its leaf water potential (Blum 2005). The osmoticpotential is adjusted through changes in the accumulationof proline, inorganic ions and other osmotic solutes(Sonobe et al. 2011). Increased deep soil water capture hasalso been found to be a major contribution of osmoticadjustment in sorghum (Blum 2005). Typically, in sor-ghum older leaves are selectively senesced under stress,while the remaining young leaves retain turgor, stomatalconductance and assimilation as a result of high osmoticadjustment in the younger leaves (Blum and Arkin 1984).This ensures photosynthetic activity by keeping top leavesgreen, and reduced transpiration water losses by oldershaded leaves under water stress. In addition, sorghum hasan effective transpiration ratio of 1 : 310, as the plant usesonly 310 parts of water to produce one part of dry matter,compared with a ratio of 1 : 400 for maize (Du Plesis2008). Hence, production of sorghum in water-scarceregions as an alternative to maize will conserve water andincrease water productivity.Morphological adaptationDrought tolerance in sorghum is consistent with its evolu-tion in Africa where domestication occurred in arid andsemi-arid areas parts of northern Africa (Morris et al.,2013). This resulted in the development of heritable mor-phological and anatomical characteristics (Dugas et al.2011). These attributes minimize yield losses associatedwith water stress.The root system is the plant organ in charge of capturingwater and nutrients, besides anchoring the plant into theground. It is naturally viewed as a critical organ to improvecrop adaptation to water stress (Vadez 2014). Under water-limiting conditions, water extraction by a dryland crop islimited by root system depth and by the rate of degree ofextraction (Robertson et al. 1993). Sorghum has long rootswith high root density at deeper depths (Schittenhelm andSchroetter 2014) with roots that can reach up to 2 m(Robertson et al. 1993) in the absence of impeding soil lay-ers. This allows sorghum to access water lower down thesoil proﬁle during water-scarce periods. Water stress can bedetrimental at vegetative stage if it inhibits root growth(Comas et al., 2013). However, this is seldom the case asunder water stress dry matter partitioning will often favourroot growth at the expense of vegetative growth (Mab-haudhi 2009). Maximum rooting depth usually occurs afteranthesis (Robertson et al. 1993). Drought tolerance andwater extraction efﬁciency in sorghum are associated withmaintaining high root length density, the number of nodalroots and late metaxylem vessels per nodal root underwater scarcity (Tsuji et al. 2005). For optimal root develop-ment, it is important that pre-ﬂowering water stress isavoided.Long, narrow, pointy leaves reduce the contact surfacearea with direct sunlight during high temperatures, hencepreventing desiccation. Sorghum leaves and stem are cov-ered by a waxy cuticle and epicuticular wax (Saneoka andOgata 1987) preventing excessive water loss during waterstress. This suggests that cuticle and epicuticular waxenhance WUE in sorghum during water stress.Tillering ability is commonly associated with sorghum inregions with limited rainfall. Tillering is generally recog-nized as one of the most plastic traits affecting biomassaccumulation and ultimately grain yield in many ﬁeldcrops (Kim et al. 2010). Genetic variation in tillering affectsthe dynamics of canopy development and hence the timingand nature of crop water limitation (Hammer et al. 2006).Simulation studies on sorghum (Hammer et al. 1996) indi-cated a signiﬁcant yield advantage of high-tillering types inhigh-yielding seasons when water was plentiful, whereassuch types incurred a signiﬁcant disadvantage in lower-yielding water-limited circumstances. However, tilleringhas been bred out of commercial cereal cultivars to ensuremaximum biomass partitioning to the yield portion.Nonetheless, tillering is a prominent feature in sorghumlandraces cultivated by subsistence farmers (Pandravadaet al. 2013) as these have not been the subject of deliberatecrop improvement. Whether tillering in landraces is beneﬁ-cial in arid and semi-arid SSA remains unclear; however,the fact that landraces still tiller may suggest that subsis-tence farmers ﬁnd an advantage to this trait. It may be thatsuch farmers associate tillering with yield compensationunder stressful conditions. Studies conducted by Lafargeet al. (2002) could not associate tillering with either yieldor drought tolerance. However, it is likely that emergenceof tillers is genetically controlled and partly serves as a sur-vival mechanism under water-stress conditions. Hence, the© 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH6Hadebe et al.selection of the best genotype is confounded by genotype-by-environment interactions for tillering (Hammer et al.2005).Phenological adaptationSorghum utilizes quiescence adaptive mechanisms to allowfor extreme drought tolerance (Dugas et al. 2011). It canremainvisuallydormantduringdroughtconditions,resuming growth once conditions are favourable (Assefaet al. 2010) ensuring crop survival and yield under terminalstress. Water stress affects sorghum at both pre- and post-ﬂowering stages of development. Pre-ﬂowering droughtstress response occurs when plants are under signiﬁcantwater stress prior to ﬂowering, particularly at or close topanicle differentiation and until ﬂowering (Kebede et al.2001). The most adverse effect of water stress on yieldoccurs during and after anthesis (Blum 2004). Post-ﬂower-ing drought stress signiﬁcantly reduces the number and sizeof the seeds per plant (Rosenow and Clark 1995), which arethe main causes for lower grain yield in sorghum (Assefaet al. 2010). Phenological plasticity of sorghum allows forshorter or delayed seasons in sorghum to minimize theeffect of water stress on yield.Water-use efﬁciencyWater-use efﬁciency captures the yield response of physio-logical, morphological and phenological adaptations towater stress. When water is scarce, understanding the mag-nitude of water consumption is important. In most cases,evaluation for decision-making requires information aboutefﬁciency – when water is being used, it is being used effec-tively. Water-use efﬁciency in sorghum is variety speciﬁc.During water stress, reduction in sorghum biomass pro-duction is minimized while water use is signiﬁcantly low-ered. Hence, maximal water-use efﬁciency (WUE) isattained under water scarcity conditions, while lowestWUE values are o', 'unique_identifier': 170}\n",

However, insufficient information is available regarding soybean crops in terms of irrigation scheduling methods and their interaction with irrigation water productivity (IWP) for different soybean varieties. The objective of this study was to quantify the effect of climate-, soil-, and plant-based irrigation scheduling methods on the physiology, yield, and IWP of three soybean varieties. A shelter experiment was conducted using a randomized design with split plots of two factors and five replications. Five irrigation methods and three soybean varieties (TMG 7067, 58i60RSF IPRO, and NA 5909) were tested. In CB (climate-based method) the evapotranspiration-water balance was used; in SB1 and SB2 (soil-based methods), irrigation at field capacity was applied when the soil matric potential reach − 20 kPa at depths of 0.1 m and 0.3 m, respectively; while In PB1 and PB2 (plant-based methods), canopy temperature depressions (CTD) of ∼2 °C and ∼4 °C, respectively, were employed to trigger irrigation. The amount of irrigation water applied under all irrigation scheduling methods ranged from 310 (PB1 and PB2) to 786 mm (V1 under SB1). The net photosynthetic rate (A), stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration (E), and leaf water potential (LWP) were higher under SB1 and SB2 than under other irrigation methods. On average, grain yield (GY) was significantly higher in SB1 (3.5 Mg ha-1), than in SB2 (3.0 Mg ha-1), CB (2.5 Mg ha-1), PB1 (2.4 Mg ha-1) and PB2 (2.0 Mg ha-1). However, it was also found that PB1 treatment resulted in significantly increased IWP (0.84 kg m-3) compared to the other irrigation treatments. Overall, the choice of irrigation scheduling methods for soybean crops under tropical conditions should be based on the technology level, water resource availability, and individual farmer goals to maximize GY per unit area (SB1 and SB2) or optimize IWP (PB1). In addition, despite the ease of use of climate- and plant-based methods, all of these methods should be calibrated against soil-based methods under different climatic conditions and for a large number of genotypes.\\n\\nPrevious article in issueNext article in issue\\nKeywords\\nCanopy temperatureEvapotranspirationSoil matric potentialWater balance\\n1. Introduction\\nThe percentage of soybean yield gaps caused by water deficit in the United States (Grassini et al., 2015), Brazil (Sentelhas et al., 2015), and China (Wang et al., 2022) is around 30%, 42%, and 50%, respectively. These percentages are expected to expand as the global climate becomes warmer, increasing the demand for new irrigated soybean fields. A recent study showed that irrigation of soybean reduces the land area required to produce an equivalent amount of biofuel crop yield by two-four times compared with rainfed management (Rodriguez et al., 2018). However, there is insufficient information available regarding soybean varieties in terms of irrigation scheduling methods.\\n\\nThe purpose of irrigation scheduling is to determine the exact amount and timing of water application to crops (Sałata et al., 2022), and it is based on at least one variable of the soil-plant-atmosphere system (Kang et al., 2021). The adoption of an adequate irrigation scheduling method is essential to secure the physiological processes of crops and, hence, yield (Kumar Jha et al., 2019). Moreover, efficient irrigation scheduling reduces water use and energy consumption (Souza and Rodrigues, 2022). In contrast, over- and under-irrigation associated with inadequate or poorly designed irrigation scheduling has resulted mainly in low grain yield and irrigation water productivity (IWP), waterlogging, soil salinization, and rises in water table levels (Yohannes et al., 2019, de Almeida et al., 2022, Quiloango-Chimarro et al., 2022).\\n\\nIrrigation scheduling methods can be classified as climate-, soil-, or plant-based (Steele et al., 1994). Climate-based methods for irrigation scheduling typically use climatological parameters to estimate potential evapotranspiration (ET), crop coefficient curves to refine crop water use estimates, and soil water storage capacity (SWSC) data (Pereira et al., 2020). Soil-based methods for irrigation scheduling are based on soil moisture sensors that are used to monitor either the soil water potential or soil water content (Bwambale et al., 2022). Plant-based methods for irrigation scheduling use crop water status measurements such as canopy temperature (Veysi et al., 2017), leaf water potential (Costa et al., 2020), sap flow rates (Conejero et al., 2007), stomatal resistance (Cannavo et al., 2016), and turgor pressure (Zimmermann et al., 2013). To date, no studies have simultaneously compared the effectiveness of these three methods in soybean production.\\n\\nScientific and field extension efforts to enhance irrigation scheduling in soybeans have concentrated on climate-based methods rather than on soil- or plant-based methods. For example, recent studies have focused on the accuracy of crop coefficient values in southern Brazil (da Silva et al., 2019) and the quantification of crop evapotranspiration using the eddy covariance technique in the USA (Anapalli et al., 2022). However, difficulties in matching an adequate irrigation scheduling method in soybean are related to larger differences in amount of irrigation water applied and IWP among genotypes, depending on the maturing group. For example, Garcia et al. (2010) reported differences between maturing varieties V and VI in amount of irrigation water applied and IWP of 65 mm and 0.6 kg m-3, respectively. In addition, in other legumes, responses to irrigation scheduling were associated with differences in growth habits (Rowland et al., 2010) and genetic differences in water use strategies (Farooq et al., 2019). In this context, it is necessary to conduct trials dealing with different irrigation scheduling methods in accordance with the characteristics of different soybean cultivars.\\n\\nThe objective of this study was to quantify the effects of different irrigation scheduling methods (soil-, climate-, and plant-based methods) used by agricultural producers on the physiology, yield, and IWP of three soybean varieties under tropical conditions.\\n\\n2. Materials and methods\\n2.1. Characterization of the experimental area, planting and crop management\\nA rain-out shelter experiment was carried out at the Biosystems Engineering Department, University of São Paulo (USP/ESALQ), Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil (22°46\\'39\" S, 47°17\\'45\" W) from October 2020 to February 2021. The cover structure consisted of a ceiling height of 5.2 m, a transparent plastic cover (diffuser film), and a black screen on the sides that intercepted 30% of the incident radiation. Waterproofed concrete containers of 0.33 m3 (1.0 m length, 0.4 m width and 0.8 m depth) were filled with sandy-loam soil (Oxisol Typic Ustox).\\n\\nDaily solar radiation, minimum and maximum air temperatures, relative humidity, and wind speed were recorded at 10-minute intervals using an automatic station installed inside the experimental area connected to a CR1000 data logger (Campbell Scientific, Logan, Utah, USA). For the estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ETo), the method of Penman-Monteith was used (Allen et al., 1998). Daily weather parameters during the growing cycle are presented in Fig. 1.\\n\\nFig. 1\\nDownload : Download high-res image (154KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 1. A: Maximum and minimum air temperature, B: relative humidity and solar radiation, and C: reference evapotranspiration (ETo) in the experimental area throughout the growing season.\\n\\nSoybean was sown on October 24, 2020, in a single row per container with an intra-row spacing of 0.40\\u2009m and an inter-row spacing of 0.09\\u2009m (10 plants per container) (Fig. S1A). The sowing date was within the soybean planting window in Southeast Brazil. Certified seed of three commercial varieties that are suitable for irrigated conditions and present a super-early cycle (118–128 days) was sourced from Compass Minerals in São Paulo, Brazil, and used in this study: TMG 7067 (V1), which is in high demand, is distinguished by its semi-determinate growth habit and belongs to maturity group 6.5 (Zuffo et al., 2022); 58i60RSF IPRO (V2), which is distinguished by its indeterminate growth habit and resistance to lodging and belongs to maturity group 5.8 (Chechi et al., 2020); and NA 5909 (V3), which is distinguished by its indeterminate growth habit and stability under varying soil and climatic conditions and belongs to maturity group 6.2 (Durli et al., 2022).\\n\\nPhosphate fertilizer was applied uniformly by hand at sowing in each container at a rate of 200\\u2009kg\\u2009P2O5 ha-1. Potassium fertilizer was top dressed on 20 and 40 days after sowing at a rate of 100\\u2009kg\\u2009K2O ha-1, being the total equivalent to 200\\u2009kg\\u2009K2O ha-1. Fertilization was based on guidelines for soybean provided by van Raij et al. (1997). The chemical soil parameters of 0–0.4\\u2009m soil layer before fertilizer application were as follows: pH, 5.2; soil organic matter content, 11.1\\u2009g\\u2009kg-1; available potassium content, 80.1\\u2009mg\\u2009kg-1; and available phosphorus content, 4.4\\u2009mg\\u2009kg-1. Pesticide applications were made when necessary and weed control was conducted manually throughout the growing season.\\n\\n2.2. Experimental design and treatments\\nA random design with split plots of two factors, irrigation scheduling methods and soybean varieties, was used in the experiment. 15 combinations of irrigation scheduling methods and soybean varieties were used in this trial. Each treatment was performed in five replicates, for a total of 75 plots (Fig. S1B). All plants were irrigated based on daily evapotranspiration (Kc initial growing = 0.50) (Allen et al., 1998) during the first 20 days. Later, soybean varieties were subjected to five irrigation scheduling methods (M) as follows: soil-moisture-based through soil water potential (SB1 and SB2), climate-based through evapotranspiration-water balance (CB), and plant-based through canopy temperature depression (PB1 and PB2). Irrigation water was provided through a drip irrigation system. A drip line of 1\\u2009m length was installed in each plot with six emitters, each with a flow rate of 0.6\\u2009L\\u2009h-1 and spaced at 0.15\\u2009m, resulting in a total flow rate of 3.6\\u2009L\\u2009h-1 per container (plot). All plots were controlled individually through micro-registers installed on a control panel.\\n\\n2.2.1. Evapotranspiration and soil water balance–based irrigation scheduling\\n2.2.1.1. Crop evapotranspiration estimation\\nSoybean crop evapotranspiration was calculated according to Eq. 1 (Allen et al., 1998):\\n(1)ETc = Kc ETo\\nwhere ETc is the daily actual evapotranspiration of soybean (mm), Kc is the crop coefficient (dimensionless), and ETo is the daily reference evapotranspiration (Penman-Monteith method) (mm). The specific Kc values (Fig. S2) adopted during the crop development (II), mid-season (III), and end season (IV) were 0.80, 1.15 and 0.50, respectively (Allen et al., 1998, Payero and Irmak, 2013). The reference evapotranspiration (ETo) was calculated on a daily step (Allen et al., 1998):\\n(2)\\nwhere Rn is the surface radiation balance (MJ m-2 d-1), G is the soil heat flux density (MJ m-2 d-1), T is the air temperature at 2\\u2009m height (°C), u2 is the wind speed at 2\\u2009m height (m s-1), es is the saturation vapour pressure (kPa), ea is the partial vapour pressure (kPa), ∆ is the slope of the saturation vapour pressure curve (kPa °C-1) and γ is the psychrometric constant (kPa °C-1).\\n\\n2.2.1.2. Water balance model\\nWater balance model represents the balance of input, output and change of soil water storage (ΔS) in the effective root zone as showed in Eq. 3 (Hillel, 2003):\\n(3)ET = I - P + U – R – D + W0 -We\\nwhere I is the irrigation amount (mm), P is the effective rainfall (mm), U is the water table recharge (mm), R is the surface runoff (mm), D is the deep percolation (mm), W0 is the initial soil water storage (mm) and We is the end soil water storage (mm). Eq. 4 was simplified since the experiment was carried out in containers under rain-out shelter conditions and then used to estimate irrigation amount (mm):\\n(4)I = ET + (We – W0)\\n\\n2.2.1.3. Irrigation shift\\nThe irrigation shift considers different data regarding soil water content. Total available water (TAW, mm) and readily available water (RAW, mm) in the top 0.40\\u2009m of the root zone were calculated as (Allen et al., 1998):\\n(5)TAW= (θFC – θPWP) × Zr\\n(6)RAW = p × TAW\\n\\nwhere θFC is the volumetric soil water content at field capacity (m3 m−3), θPWP is the volumetric soil water content at permanent wilting point (m3 m−3), Zr =\\u2009root system depth (mm), and p is the average fraction of the total available water (TAW) that can be depleted from the root zone before water stress occurs (ranging between 0 and 1). In the case of soybean, p is equal to 0.50 (Allen et al., 1998). On a daily basis, Eq. 4 was employed to estimate the amount of irrigation. When the calculated value was close to the threshold represented by RAW, irrigation was initiated to return to θFC.\\n\\n2.2.2. Soil-moisture-based irrigation scheduling\\nIrrigation scheduling based on soil moisture was managed according to the average soil matric potential measured through tensiometry in all five plot replications of each soybean variety. In each plot, a battery of two tensiometers installed at 0.1 and 0.3\\u2009m depths provided measurements of 0–0.2 and 0.2–0.4\\u2009m soil layers, respectively. Soil matric potential was monitored daily, and irrigation was carried out to increase the soil water to field capacity for each soil layer according to the following criteria: a) SB1, when the soil matric potential reached around −\\u200920 kPa at 0.1\\u2009m depth and b) SB2, when the soil matric potential reached around −\\u200920 kPa at 0.3\\u2009m depth.\\n\\nThe amount of irrigation was estimated from the soil matric potential using the van Genuchten approach (van Genuchten, 1980), according to Eq. 7:\\n(7)\\nwhere θ (ψm) is the soil volumetric water content (cm3 cm-3), θr is the soil residual volumetric water content (cm3 cm−3), θs is the volumetric water content of the saturated soil (cm3 cm−3), m and n are the regression parameters of equation (dimensionless), α is the parameter with dimension equal to the inverse of the tension (kPa−1) and ψm is the function of the matric potential (kPa). The fitting parameters for the van Genuchten model and the physical water-retention parameters of the soil (Table 1) were estimated using non-deformed soil samples collected prior to the beginning of the trial at two depths, 0.1 and 0.3\\u2009m.\\n\\nTable 1.

Plant-based irrigation scheduling\\nThe canopy temperature (Tc) was measured using a portable infrared sensor TIV 6500 (Vonder, Curitiba, Brazil) with the emissivity adjustment set at 0.95. The device has a minimum measurement diameter of 6\\u2009mm and a distance to spot size of 10:1.\\n\\nThe canopy temperature data collection was conducted from 21 DAS until the end of the growing season. Measurements were continuously replicated for five readings of each plot at the top of the canopy, focusing on sampling leaves that were fully exposed to the sunlight from 10:30 to 11:30 AM, and then averaged. Canopy temperature depression (CTD) was calculated for each soybean variety, according to Eq. 8:\\n(8)CTD = Tc – Tair\\nwhere Tc is the canopy temperature and Tair is the air temperature readings during the measurement period. Irrigation was triggered according to the following criteria: a) PB1, when the average CTD was ∼2\\u2009°C and b) PB2, when the average CTD was ∼4\\u2009°C. These CTD thresholds were developed based on preliminary data collected by our team (Almeida, 2021).\\n\\nThe amount of irrigation was calculated according to evapotranspiration and soil water balance methodology. However, only steps corresponding to items 2.2.1.1 (crop evapotranspiration estimation) and 2.2.1.2 (soil water balance) were conducted because under these plant-based methods, irrigation started when CTD reached the corresponding threshold for PB1 and PB2.\\n\\n2.3. Physiological measurements\\nPhysiological measurements were conducted at 37 DAS (end of the vegetative stage) and 52 DAS (floral initiation of soybean). The gas exchange parameters: net photosynthesis (A), stomatal conductance (gs), and transpiration (E); and predawn leaf water potential (LWP) were measured on fully expanded leaves from the top of the plant. Gas exchange parameters were measured in three replications per plot with a portable gas exchange system Li-6400 XT (IRGA/LiCOR-Inc, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) from 9:00 to 11:00\\u2009h. The equipment was set to use concentrations of 400 μmol CO2 mol−1 in the leaf chamber, and the photon flux density photosynthetic active used was 1000 μmol [quanta] m−2 s−1.\\n\\nPredawn LWP of soybean was measured with a pressure chamber model 3005 (Soil Moisture, Santa Barbara, California, USA). One leaf of each plot was sampled between 3:00 and 5:00 AM and processed in the pressure chamber, which was slowly pressurized until a droplet of liquid appeared on the cut surface. In order to reveal integrated treatment effects, pooled data of physiological parameters (average values for the two measurement dates) were used to perform the analysis of variance.\\n\\n2.4. Shoot growth parameters, yield and irrigation water productivity\\nPlants were harvested from a subsample of each plot (plants from the central part of the row) at physiological maturity and divided into vegetative and reproductive components. To measure plant height and stem diameter, a flexible measuring tape and a digital pachymeter were used, respectively. Leaf area was determined with a leaf area meter LI-3000\\u2009C (LiCOR-Inc, Lincoln, Nebraska, USA). The leaf area index (LAI) was calculated by dividing measured leaf area by sampling area. Additionally, the number of nodes per plant was recorded. The aboveground components were then dried at 60\\u2009°C in an oven with forced air circulation for 72\\u2009h. Then, vegetative and reproductive components were weighed on a precision scale to obtain the aboveground biomass, yield and yield components (pods per plant and 100-grain weight). The grain yield was adjusted for 130\\u2009g\\u2009kg−1 moisture and scaled to Mg ha-1. Irrigation water productivity (kg m-3) was calculated as the ratio of grain yield to the total amount of water applied.\\n\\n2.5. Statistical analysis\\nAll the statistical analyses were performed with R Studio (R Project for Statistical Computing, version 4.1.2). Shapiro-Wilk and Levene tests were used for the estimation of normality and homogeneity of variance. The effects of irrigation scheduling and variety were evaluated at the 0.05 and 0.01 probability levels using the F-test. The means of variables with a significant F-test value were compared using the Fisher’s least significant difference test (LSD) at 0.05 probability level. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to generate the bi-plots to show the relationship between the varieties and the assessed variables under the different irrigation scheduling methods. To assess the suitability of the data for PCA, Bartlett\\'s test of sphericity was performed to check for multicollinearity among the variables (Rojas-Valverde et al., 2020).\\n\\n3. Results\\n3.1. Irrigation water applied\\nThis study revealed significant variations in the amount of water applied using various irrigation methods. On average, the amount of irrigation water applied was significantly higher in SB1 (614\\u2009mm), than in SB2 (522\\u2009mm), CB (358\\u2009mm), PB2 (310\\u2009mm) and PB1 (309\\u2009mm). The total amount of irrigation water applied ranged from 309\\u2009mm for PB1 in varieties V1, V2 and V3 to 786\\u2009mm for SB1 in V1 (Table 2). Moreover, the irrigation water applied in SB1 was higher than that applied in SB2 for the three varieties V1, V3, and V2 in that order. In the CB and PB methods (PB1 and PB2), the amount of water applied varied depending on the phenological stage but not on the crop variety, as the crop coefficient (Kc) varied only by phenological stage.\\n\\nTable 2.

The number of irrigation events varied among the methods, with SB1 having the highest number of events (on average, 43 events), and CB and PB2 having the lowest number of events (on average, 36 events).\\n\\n3.2. Physiological responses\\nThe irrigation scheduling method had a significant impact on the photosynthetic rate (A), stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration (E), and leaf water potential (LWP). In contrast, the effect of soybean variety was only significant on gs and E. Furthermore, the interaction between irrigation scheduling method and soybean variety was significant for gs and LWP (Table 3).\\n\\nTable 3.

Specifically, the A values were reduced by 11.5%, 19.3%, and 27.8% for CB, PB1, and PB2, respectively, compared to SB1, which had the highest A values. Notably, V2 under the CB method exhibited gs values similar to those of SB1 and SB2, whereas for V3, PB1, and PB2 resulted in a greater reduction in gs values compared to SB2. The results also showed that transpiration (E) values were similar for SB1, SB2, and CB, but significantly decreased by 30.8% and 36.9% for PB1 and PB2, respectively, compared to SB1. Furthermore, the E values for V1 and V2 were higher than those for V3 by 17.8% and 14.5%, respectively.\\n\\nRegarding leaf water potential, all soybean varieties exhibited a distinct behavior, with higher values obtained using the SB methods and lower values obtained using the PB methods (Table 3). Notably, the CB method achieved LWP values similar to those obtained using the SB method (SB1 and SB2), except for V1. In contrast, PB2 consistently exhibited the lowest LWP values for all soybean varieties examined. Overall, the results indicated that soil moisture-based methods favored higher values of A, gs, E, and LWP than the other methods evaluated.\\n\\n3.3. Morphological, yield and irrigation water productivity responses\\nThe interaction between irrigation scheduling and variety was significant for leaf area index (LAI) and stem diameter (SD). The individual effects of irrigation scheduling and variety were significant for plant height (PH), leaf area index (LAI), stem diameter (SD) and number of nodes per plant (NNP), except irrigation scheduling for NNP (Table 4).\\n\\nTable 4.

PB1 and PB2 had the lowest average plant height. In addition, it was notable that the semi-determinate growth variety (V1) was tallest compared with the indeterminate growth varieties (V2 and V3). Under SB1 and SB2, the LAI was similar, indicating consistent performance and the highest average values among the irrigation treatments. In contrast, under the PB1 and PB2 treatments, all soybean varieties exhibited reduced LAI compared with SB methods. Notably, when comparing V2 under CB, the LAI values were comparable to those of SB1 and SB2. However, under PB1 and PB2, V2 displayed the largest reductions in LAI compared with the other varieties. Stem diameter followed a similar trend as LAI, showing the highest values for the SB methods. However, V1 exhibited reduced SD values for the CB and PB methods when compared to the SB methods, and V2 showed similar SD values among irrigation treatments, except for PB1.\\n\\nIrrigation scheduling was significant for grain yield (GY), aboveground biomass (AB), and pods per plant (PP), whereas variety was significant for all these traits and for 100-grain weight (HGW). The interaction between irrigation scheduling and variety was significant for AB and PP (Table 5).\\n\\nTable 5.

As the leading producer and ex-\\nporter of agricultural produce in the United States, 5.6 percent of California’s energy is currently\\nused for pumping groundwater. These problems and new regulatory policies (e.g., Sustainable\\nGroundwater Management Act, Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program) pressure growers to schedule,\\naccount and maintain records of water, energy and nutrients needed for crop and soil management.\\nGrowers require varying levels of decision support to integrate different irrigation strategies into\\nfarm operations. Decision support can come from the public or private sector, where there are\\nmany tradeoffs between cost, underlying science, user friendliness and overall challenges in farm\\nintegration. Thus, effective irrigation management requires clear deﬁnitions, decision support and\\nguidelines for how to incorporate and evaluate the water–nutrient–energy nexus beneﬁts of different\\npractices and combinations of practices under shifting water governance. The California Energy\\nCommission-sponsored Energy Product Evaluation Hub (Cal-EPE Hub) project has a mission of\\nproviding science-based evaluation of energy-saving technologies as a direct result of improved water\\nmanagement for irrigation in agriculture, including current and future irrigation decision support\\nsystems in California. This project incorporates end-user perceptions into evaluations of existing\\ndecision support tools in partnership with government, agricultural and private stakeholders. In this\\narticle, we review the policy context and science underlying the available irrigation decision support\\nsystems (IDSS), discuss the beneﬁts/tradeoffs and report on their efﬁcacy and ease of use for the\\nmost prevalent cropping systems in California. Finally, we identify research and knowledge-to-action\\ngaps for incorporating irrigation decision support systems into new incentives and requirements for\\nreporting water and energy consumption as well as salinity and nitrogen management in the state\\nof California.\\nKeywords: food–water–energy nexus; nitrate leaching; precision agriculture; water productivity;\\nirrigation management; soil moisture\\n1. Introduction\\nAgricultural production in California includes the cultivation of approximately 400 crops\\naccounting for one-third of vegetable and two-thirds of fruit and nut production in the\\nUnited States [1]. According to California Agricultural Production Statistics (2019), this\\nagricultural abundance makes California a leading US state accounting for over 13% of the\\ncountry’s total value in agricultural production. Some of California’s leading crops include\\nalmonds, grapes, strawberries, pistachios, lettuce, walnuts and processing tomatoes [1]. In\\norder to produce these crops for export across the country and other parts of the world,\\ngreat amounts of water, fertilizer and energy are used. In California, agricultural water\\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962. https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12081962\\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\\n2 of 31\\nuse represents one-ﬁfth of the electricity consumed for water use and four percent of total\\nelectricity consumption annually [2]. Approximately 75–80% of the total water pumped is\\nused to irrigate three million hectares throughout the state [3,4]. The majority of the water\\nand energy consumption is during the summer growing season (June to August), relying on\\ngroundwater that uses between 496 to 1750 Megajoules per Megaliter of water [5]. Declines\\nin aquifer levels, increased land subsidence and loss of storage strain growers for energy\\nefﬁciency improvements in drought years. The ampliﬁed demand for water and energy\\nduring drought also lowers stream ﬂows and lake levels, which impact the production\\nof hydroelectric power. In addition, the water table is lowered continually during these\\nperiods, as growers pump groundwater from deeper wells demanding more power. The\\nCalifornia drought assessment of 2014 reported a loss of 8.1 million ML of surface water\\nwith a simultaneous increase of 6.3 million ML in groundwater pumped for an additional\\ncost of USD 454 million [6]. Flood and furrow irrigation still account for approximately\\n40 percent of the total irrigated area in California, despite the advances and investments in\\nirrigation systems. The adoption of the drip and micro-sprinkler irrigation signiﬁcantly\\nincreased in acreage between 1991 (0.52 million hectares) and 2010 (16 million hectares) [7].\\nFigure 1 identiﬁes the hydrologic regions across the state of California and the distribution\\nof major crops, irrigation methods and levels of salinity in irrigation water.\\nCalifornia’s increasing severity of droughts not only depletes groundwater but also\\nincreases the carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions from increased burning of\\nfossil fuels to generate the power for pumping groundwater. After facing several severe\\ndrought years, state leaders implemented incentives, regulations and policies to manage\\ngroundwater that require record keeping and reporting of water use, nitrogen (N) leaching\\nand energy consumption. Simple and scalable irrigation decision support systems are\\nneeded to facilitate base information for growers to manage and maximize irrigation\\nwater, energy and N use efﬁciency. On-farm water management using irrigation decision\\nsupport systems coordinates the development and management of water, land and related\\nresources aimed toward equitable economic welfare and sustainable water use for future\\ngenerations [8,9]. Irrigation decision support systems (IDSS) are integrated solutions\\ncombining and interpreting real-time meteorological, soil moisture and/or crop water\\nstress data using telemetric services to help growers make irrigation decisions. Most of\\nthe ﬁrst IDSS developed in California ranged from spreadsheets to stand-alone software.\\nWith recent improvements in public weather-station networks, sensor technology, satellite\\nand aerial imaging, wireless communications and cloud computing, web and smartphone\\napplications automating a range of complex calculations involved in evapotranspiration-\\nbased irrigation scheduling, crop and soil nitrogen status IDDS have been developed.\\nThe California Energy Product Evaluation Hub (or Hub) was proposed by the Califor-\\nnia Energy Commission to ﬁll an information gap between energy sector manufacturers\\nand large commercial and institutional customers. The purpose of the Hub is to accelerate\\nthe adoption of beneﬁcial technologies by informing customers purchasing distributed\\nenergy resource products through procurement processes. The objectives of the Hub are to\\nevaluate the selected distributed energy resource products (e.g., IDSS) in a rigorous and\\ntransparent manner and widely disseminate the evaluation results to large commercial and\\ninstitutional customers. The evaluations will allow comparisons of similar technologies,\\nas well as comparisons to existing government and industry standards. The evaluations,\\nand the data behind them, will be distributed through the Hub’s public web platform. The\\nHub is a cooperative effort among the University of California, Davis, Lawrence Berkeley\\nNational Laboratory, Energy Solutions and the Center for the Built Environment of the\\nUniversity of California, Berkeley.\\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\\n3 of 31\\nare integrated into existing crop irrigation management as part of the ongoing research of \\nthe California Energy Product Evaluation Hub.

Finally, we identify knowledge gaps in\\nIDSS research and current available tools for integrating energy, nitrogen leaching and soil\\nsalinity management.\\n2. Objective and Review Methodology\\nWe identiﬁed all active IDSS in California through a comprehensive search of all IDSS\\non the search engines and in consultation with a California IDSS product advisory group.\\nThe IDSS product advisory group consisted of growers, certiﬁed crop advisors, cooperative\\nextension advisors, the California Department of Agriculture, California Agricultural\\nIrrigation Association and additional government, industry and trade organizations. The\\nadvisory group helped deﬁne the IDSS needs for the California cropping system. This\\ninformation was used to identify the commercially or freely available technologies and\\nexclude the IDSS that have not yet been made available for widespread use.\\nSection 3 deﬁnes California’s water management context and the need for IDSS un-\\nder increasing drought, regulation and risk management. Section 4 provides a broad\\noverview of soil–plant–atmosphere approaches for IDSS. Section 5 describes the commer-\\ncially available IDSS based on soil tension, canopy temperature, stem water potential and\\nremote-sensing techniques. Section 6 describes the science, policy and role of IDSS for\\nintegrated irrigation and energy management in agricultural systems. Section 7 describes\\nthe science, policy and role of IDSS for integrated irrigation and nitrogen (N) management\\nto control the environmental problems or groundwater contamination due to excessive\\nN fertilizer uses. Section 8 describes the science, policy and role of IDSS for integrated\\nirrigation and salinity management. Sections 9 and 10 focus on IDSS as a holistic effort\\nfor water, nutrient and salinity management and consider the innovation, validation and\\nadoption strategies.\\n3. Context for IDSS in California Agriculture\\n3.1. Water Scarcity\\nOverdrawn aquifers, decline in snowpack, frequent droughts and rising evaporative\\ndemand are increasing water scarcity in California. These water resource concerns have\\nled to decreasing water availability for irrigation, increasing regulation (e.g., reduced allo-\\ncations), increasing energy consumption, difﬁculty in water/fertilization co-management\\nand increasing water and energy prices. Because the annual evaporative demand exceeds\\nprecipitation in the majority of California, irrigation is generally considered compulsory.\\nWhile most of the precipitation falls in the winter, key economic crops have high water\\ndemands during the spring–summer–fall season. Additionally, there is a spatial disconnect\\nbetween precipitation and agricultural water demand in California. Most of the surface\\nwater used for agriculture comes from precipitation in the northern part of the state, while\\nthe Central Valley and southern parts of the state have the greatest demand for agricultural\\nwater. These discrepancies in space and time have led to complex water conveyance,\\nstorage and transfer systems that are important for understanding the potential beneﬁts of\\nIDSS for California growers [10].\\nAlthough California spans a wide range of climates, much of the state, including\\nsome of the most productive farmland, occupies semi-arid regions of the Central and Impe-\\nrial Valleys, which are characterized by a Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers\\nand mild, wet winters. Statewide, the average water use is roughly 50% environmental,\\n40% agricultural and 10% urban [11]. By necessity, California has adopted management\\nstrategies to deal with water shortages, such as reusing water, long-distance water con-\\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\\n5 of 31\\nveyance and desalination technologies to complement local ground and surface water [12].\\nUnfortunately, water supply diversiﬁcation strategies can also lead to increased energy use\\nand, consequently, to increased greenhouse gas emissions [13]. California’s water system is\\nestimated to emit 10% of the state’s greenhouse gas emissions [14]. Water–energy nexus\\napproaches recognize the close connection between water and energy and the importance\\nof considering all aspects of these complex systems [15,16]. As irrigation makes up a large\\nportion of the water supply system in the state, it is under critical consideration by both\\ngovernment agencies and agricultural end users. Policy makers face the difﬁcult task of\\nbalancing the needs of diverse stakeholders, protecting the environment and providing\\nreliable, sustainable water supplies to agricultural, industrial and residential customers [16].\\nAt the same time, California growers face more frequent and severe drought events, warmer\\ntemperatures and variable rainfall associated with climate change [17], leading to increasing\\ndependence on irrigation [18].\\nGrowers also face increasing competition for irrigation water and growing concerns\\nabout the environmental impacts of irrigation. Growers pay for water, energy and infras-\\ntructure to irrigate crops. California growers pay between USD 12/106 ML−1 water in\\ndirect costs and USD 17/151 ML−1 water in energy costs [19–21]. While growers are willing\\nto adopt new technologies to reduce risks during periods of water shortage, the information\\nprovided by extension services and other educational sources plays an important role in\\nnew irrigation technology adoption [22].\\n3.2. Regulations\\nCalifornia growers identify the key barriers to water and energy conservation efforts as\\n(1) cost, (2) a lack of return on investment (3) and uncertainty about the future of available\\nwater. Cost alone is not enough to increase IDSS adoption or agricultural water conserva-\\ntion [23]. In semi-arid regions, regulating surface water without regulating groundwater (or\\nvice versa) increases pressure on the unregulated water source instead of increasing the use\\nof IDSS [24]. However, approaches that involve cooperation across institutional ecosystems\\nas well as multi-actor governance and participation to jointly regulate groundwater and\\nsurface water quantity, nutrient/pollutant transport and energy usage may increase IDSS\\nadoption [23,25].\\nFor the past century, California has been a demonstrative example where the reg-\\nulation and governance of surface water quantity and quality have placed tremendous\\nstress on groundwater supply and energy required to pump groundwater in years with\\nlimited surface water allocation. However, the legislation and policies adapted in 2014–2016\\nare attempting to jointly regulate groundwater and surface water quantity, quality and\\ncooperation across institutions. In 2014, California passed the Sustainable Groundwater\\nManagement Act (SGMA), in which two state agencies (Department of Water Resources and\\nState Water Resources Control Board) mandate and oversee communities self-organizing\\ninto groundwater sustainability agencies [26]. Each agency created groundwater sustain-\\nability plans to achieve sustainability goals by 2040–2042. Similarly, in 2014, the California\\nIrrigated Lands Regulatory Program was expanded to regulate nitrates in discharge to\\nboth surface and groundwater from irrigated agricultural lands [27]. California’s 2020\\nheat wave and widespread agricultural power outages have spurred agricultural trade\\norganizations to consider the need for IDSS to accommodate off-peak energy usage and\\nregulations imposed by utility companies [28]. However, there are not yet any direct\\nstatewide regulations on the energy used for groundwater pumping in California.\\n3.3. Loss and Risk Management\\n3.3.1. Infrastructure Failures\\nIDSS could help growers plan for water usage throughout the growing season when\\nadjustments may be required to accommodate irrigation interruptions to avoid yield losses\\nat critical moments. For example, in the 2018 Census on Irrigation and Water Management,\\n1792 CA growers (29,538 ha) reported yield losses because of irrigation interruptions related\\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\\n6 of 31\\nto groundwater/surface water shortages, equipment failure, energy shortages, high salinity,\\nloss of water rights or increase in water costs [29]. Having a formal IDSS in place does not\\nprevent water, energy or infrastructure disruptions but instead could assist in identifying\\nequipment failures and providing the projected data and calculations needed for difﬁcult\\ndecisions—how best to prioritize the available water across the farm to the crops that will\\nhave the highest potential for short- and long-term revenue.\\n3.3.2. Disease-Based Losses and Water\\nGrowers using intuitive, informal irrigation practices may err on the side of applying\\n‘extra’ water to ensure that crop water requirements are met. Additionally, some IDSS may\\nalso err on the side of overprediction of evapotranspiration and crop water requirements\\nto match grower management practices. Although this logic may decrease the risk of\\nunderwatering or water stress, it can increase water logging, nitrate leaching, anoxia,\\ndenitriﬁcation, salinity, soil erosion and runoff, in addition to the wasted energy and water\\ncosts [30]. In California perennial crops, overirrigation or irrigating too soon can impact\\nroot development—especially of shallow, ﬁne roots—which can lead to long-term yield\\nlosses, especially if the root zone oxygen concentration drops below 10% [31]. In both\\nannual and perennial crops, overirrigation that increases soil and/or canopy moisture can\\noften increase the survival, growth, infection and dispersal of pathogens, which ultimately\\nleads to disease-based yield losses [32]. However, it is important to note that not supplying\\nenough water to meet crop needs can also trigger many belowground diseases [32]. For\\na comprehensive review of irrigation–disease interactions, please see Swett (2020) [32].\\nAlthough IDSS could integrate crop-speciﬁc co-management of water and diseases in the\\nfuture, to the best of our knowledge, no IDSS currently have this function for California\\ncropping systems.\\n4. Soil–Plant–Atmosphere Approaches and Data for IDSS in California\\n4.1. Precipitation\\nPrecipitation is an important component of the hydrologic cycle considered for all\\nwater budgets. In California, real-time rainfall data can be acquired from different sources,\\nsuch as the Department of Water Resources California Irrigation Management Information\\nSystem (CIMIS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s California Nevada\\nRiver Forecast Center (CNRFC) and United States Climate Data. For annual water budget-\\ning, monthly precipitation data are often used. Several researchers have observed decreases\\nin precipitation and increases in autumn temperatures since the 1980s [33,34]. In 2018, the\\ndelayed start of precipitation months resulted in the most destructive wildﬁres of California,\\nburning about 766,439 hectares of land area [34,35]. This has not only disturbed water\\nbudget planning and estimation, but it has also impacted the contamination of groundwater\\nand other available sources of irrigation by changing the pH due to debris and ash [36].\\n4.2. Evapotranspiration\\nEvapotranspiration depends on weather conditions, crop type, canopy density/\\ndevelopment, stomatal conductance and regulation, irrigation system and management,\\nsoil management and soil type. In California, the estimates of reference evapotranspiration\\n(ETo) come from the 153 active CIMIS stations that are sited, maintained and equipped\\nby the California Department of Water Resources to measure shortwave solar radiation\\n(pyranometer), soil temperature (thermistor), air temperature (HMP35), relative humidity\\n(HMP35), wind direction (wind vane), wind speed (anemometer) and precipitation (tipping\\nbucket rain gauge). The state is divided into 18 ETo climatic zones based on long-term\\nmonthly CIMIS averages. Additionally, a spatial CIMIS data product combines the network\\nof available stations for ground measurement and satellite data in order to simulate the\\nETo of the whole state. CIMIS estimates hourly ETo for cool-season grass with a height\\nof 0.10–0.15 m using the CIMIS Penman equation, which is modiﬁed from the Penman\\nequation [37], with an approach for estimating net radiation from shortwave solar radiation,\\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\\n7 of 31\\ntemperature and relative humidity measurements developed and validated using 71 net\\nradiometers across California [38]. The CIMIS Penman equation also uses different weights\\nfor wind speed in the hourly estimation of ETo depending on whether it is day or night\\ntime and a unique cloud factor obtained from each CIMIS station [39].\\nIn addition to the CIMIS network, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-\\ntion (NOAA) Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) satellites have\\nbeen used to predict incoming solar radiation as the main source energy for evapotran-\\nspiration. Satellite-based ETo maps are calculated on a two-kilometer grid, which is an\\nimportant contribution of data for decision making, given that the distance between the\\nCIMIS stations can be tens of kilometers. These freely available estimates of ETo can be\\npaired with crop-speciﬁc coefﬁcients (Kc) to estimate crop evapotranspiration (ETc) during\\nthe growing season. It is important to note that evapotranspiration offers decision support\\nas to how much water has been used by the crop based on meteorological data or will be\\nused by the crop based on meteorological forecasting [40,41].\\n4.3. Irrigation Scheduling Resources\\nThe quantity and timing of water application to irrigate a crop is a critical part of\\nplanning a growing season. Crop management activities are mainly dependent on the\\nmoisture present in the soil and root matrix. Scheduling depends on the combination\\nof evaporative demand from the atmosphere, spatial and temporal heterogeneity in soil\\nproperties and changes in crop canopy during a growing season. California IDSS currently\\nschedule irrigation by measuring, remotely sensing and/or modeling some combination of\\nthree different categories: (1) evapotranspiration, (2) allowable depletion of soil moisture\\nand (3) canopy characteristics [42]. In this work, we discuss California IDSS and state\\nspeciﬁc data sources that can be used to ascertain data from these categories and represent\\nthese tools and sensors in Figure 2. These categories are used in IDSS throughout the world,\\nand we recommend Gu et al. (2020) for an in-depth general review [43].\\n4.3.1. In Situ Calculation of Crop Coefﬁcient Values\\nCrop coefﬁcient (Kc) values can be obtained for the entire growing season from his-\\ntorical evapotranspiration databases for specialty crops (almonds, walnuts, pistachios,\\nprocessing tomatoes, etc.) developed by the University of California under the drought man-\\nagement program. There are available databases maintained by the University of Califor-\\nnia Agriculture and Natural Resources (https://www.sacvalleyorchards.com/et-reports/\\n(accessed on 20 August 2021)) Westlands Water Districts (https://wwd.ca.gov/water-\\nmanagement/irrigation-guide/ (accessed on 20 August 2021)) that provide regional esti-\\nmates of ETo and ETc for growers. Signiﬁcant efforts have been made to measure actual\\nevapotranspiration to derive the Kc values speciﬁc to California crops and management.\\nDirect measurements using lysimetry, eddy covariance and surface renewal have estimated\\nKc values for almond, pistachio, walnut, processing tomato, wine grapes, lettuce, rice,\\ncorn, wheat, and alfalfa (Table 1) [44–68]. It is important to note that the Kc values derived\\nfrom actual evapotranspiration studies have several assumptions and site-speciﬁc limita-\\ntions for widespread adoption and water use projections. Attention should be given as\\nto whether water stress had occurred during the actual evapotranspiration measurement\\nperiods as well as the uncertainty of actual evapotranspiration estimates by a method-\\nological approach. The use of crop coefﬁcients for irrigation of perennial crops is often\\nmore challenging than for annual crops. This is because there can be signiﬁcant variability\\nas a consequence of the crop density, crop load, row orientation, variety, irrigation sys-\\ntem, pruning, ﬂoor management, soil type, salinity/sodicity and plant vigor between the\\ntwo types.\\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1962\\n8 of 31\\ny\\nstate specific data sources that can be used to ascertain data from these categories a\\nrepresent these tools and sensors in Figure 2.

According to the normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) \\nand the relative error (RE), WinSRFR had, on average, excellent accuracy in the continuous and surge \\nirrigation for simulating advance-recession times (NRMSE: 6.15 and 4.24% for advance time, and \\n2.20 and 5.20% for recession time), infiltrated water depth (NRMSE: 3.37 and 6.38%), and runoff \\nvolume (RE: 6.93 and 2.57%), respectively. SIRMOD had also, on average, excellent simulation in the \\ncontinuous and surge irrigation for advance-recession times (NRMSE: 3.34 and 2.45% for advance \\ntime, and 2.28 and 6.41% for recession time), infiltrated water depth (NRMSE: 2.98 and 5.27%), and \\nrunoff volume (RE: 5.31 and 17.49%), respectively. The average of irrigation application efficiency (AE), \\ndistribution uniformity (DU), deep percolation (DP), and tail-water ratio (TWR ) were 61.50, 90.25, \\n11.75, and 26.75% in continuous irrigation, and 72.03, 94.09, 8.39, and 19.57% in surge irrigation, \\nrespectively, which shows that surge irrigation increased AE (irrigation management performance) \\nand DU (irrigation method performance) and reduced DP and TWR  compared to continuous \\nirrigation. Moreover, longer furrow lengths increased AE and DP under both irrigation methods, \\nwhile it decreased TWR  and DU. However, increasing the stream size decreased AE and DP and \\nincreased TWR  under both continuous and surge irrigations. The higher stream size improved DU in \\ncontinuous irrigation but reduced DU in surge irrigation. The results confirmed that both SIRMOD and \\nWinSRFR are reliable analytical tools to evaluate furrow irrigation strategies for improving irrigation \\nmanagement. In conclusion, this study showed that surface irrigation models could be employed in \\npractice by irrigation engineers and practitioners to design and define the optimized furrow length and \\nstream size in arid and semi-arid areas where efficient and high performance irrigation strategies are \\nrequired to save water and reduce water loss.\\nSurface irrigation is still the most popular irrigation system because of its simplicity of design, low cost and \\nenergy requirements, and low investment  requirements1,2. Currently, more than 70% of the irrigated lands in Iran \\nare under surface irrigation, and most of these fields are irrigated as furrow  irrigation3. However, the sustainability \\nof surface irrigation systems does not solely depend on irrigation technology but also depends on proper irriga-\\ntion  management4. The challenges for adopting climate resilient irrigation practices are still enormous because \\nmore than 95 and 80% of irrigated farms in Asia and the Middle East are surface  irrigated4. Therefore, this makes \\nsurface irrigation an important target research goal since it has great impact on the catchment water resources \\nin semi-arid  areas5. In this regard, precise surface irrigation management depends on designing appropriate \\nsurface irrigation methods, which improve irrigation performance  indicators6,7. In a recent study, Bryant et\\xa0al.8 \\nreported that nearly 80% of mid-southern U.S. farms are irrigated through furrow irrigation with low applica-\\ntion efficiency. Thus, improving the performance of surface irrigation systems requires extensive research and \\nevaluating the deriving components of the irrigation  system4,9.\\nOPEN\\n1Water Engineering Department, School of Agriculture, Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran. 2Drought Research Center, \\nShiraz University, Shiraz, Iran. *email: seyedhamid.ahmadi@gmail.com\\n2\\nVol:.(1234567890)\\nScientific Reports |         (2023) 13:5768  | \\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-32842-8\\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\\nGenerally, imprecise irrigation management would increases runoff and deep percolation in furrow irriga-\\ntion system and reduces the efficiency and distribution  uniformity10. The primary parameters that influence \\nirrigation system performance are stream size, furrow field length, soil roughness, field slope, soil infiltration \\nrate, and cut-off  time4. To reduce water losses and increasing the efficiency of surface irrigation, researchers have \\nsuggested surge irrigation and cutback flow  methods11,12, appropriate field length and  slope13,14, and determining \\nthe appropriate amount of stream size and cut-off  time13,15.\\nSurge irrigation is the process of intermittently applying water to furrows in a series of nearly short on- and \\noff-times that could subsequently change physical characteristics of the soil surface resulting in uniform appli-\\ncation and infiltration of  water16–19. The first studies of surge irrigation dates back to early 1980 with focus on \\nimproving advance rate, surface irrigation efficiencies and uniformities and reducing the total amount of irriga-\\ntion  water20–23. Given that continuous irrigation has low  efficiency24, the use of surge irrigation combined with \\nappropriate furrow variables (stream size, cut-off time, and furrow length) would be a promising alternative to \\ncontinuous irrigation for conservation of water resources and reduction of water  losses12,25,26. Surge irrigation \\nhas been reported to reduce water losses and improved water distribution in  soil11,18,19,27,28. Nevertheless, Henry \\net\\xa0al.29 reported that about 4–6% of furrow-irrigated fields are just irrigated by surge irrigation, which is very \\nsmall compared with the continuous irrigation. In a recent study, Bryant et\\xa0al.8 reported that surge irrigation can \\nlead to an increase in application efficiency up to 209% while runoff, deep percolation, and total water applied \\nwere reduced by 57, 64, and 31%, respectively. Coolidge et\\xa0al.30 showed that surge irrigation reduces the infiltrated \\nvolume for the advance time and improves the distribution uniformity along the furrow.\\nHowever, the hydraulic process of surface irrigation is complex since it simultaneously combines surface \\nflow with infiltration into the soil profile. Several computer models have been developed for surface irrigation \\nsimulation. The use of models in design allows taking into consideration the factors that interact with multicri-\\nteria analysis of surface  irrigation4. The WinSRFR and SIRMOD models are among the most powerful models \\nused to design and evaluate surface irrigation systems in continuous and surge irrigation methods. Xu et\\xa0al.14, \\nNie et\\xa0al.31, and Mazarei et\\xa0al.2 used the WinSRFR model to evaluate and optimize the physical parameters of \\nfurrows. Likewise, various  researchers32–34 used the SIRMOD model to evaluate continuous surface irrigation \\nsystems whilst Ismail et\\xa0al.35, and Ismail and  Depeweg11 used the SIRMOD model in assessing surge irrigation.. \\nHowever, because of the difficulty in implementing and managing surge irrigation, few studies have been done \\non surge surface irrigation.\\nPrevious studies have focused on evaluation and optimization of the continuous surface irrigation \\n systems2,13,14,36. However, there is a knowledge gap on evaluation and simulation of surge irrigation manage-\\nment. In this study, different surge irrigation scenarios have been developed and simulated by the SIRMOD and \\nWinSRFR models. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous study comparing the performance of these \\ntwo models in surge irrigation, and this study provides solutions to simplify surge irrigation simulation. SIR-\\nMOD and WinSRFR models potentially serve as the analytical tools for simulating field irrigation management \\nscenarios that help decision-makers, field managers, and irrigation professionals for assessing furrow irrigation \\ntechniques. The concern considered in this research is the furrow irrigation performance and the reduction of \\nwater losses; thus, efforts have been made to improve them. We hypothesized that surge irrigation improves \\nirrigation performance. The study aimed to assess the performance of the two simulation models namely; SIR-\\nMOD and WinSRFR under continuous and surge irrigation. Thus, the specific objectives of this study were: (1) \\nevaluating continuous and surge irrigation methods under field conditions to improve irrigation performance, \\nand (2) assessing model performance of the SIRMOD and WinSRFR models in simulating the continuous and \\nsurge irrigation methods.\\nMaterial and methods\\nField description. \\nThe field experiment was conducted at the School of Agriculture, Shiraz University, Shi-\\nraz, Iran. The location of the field experiment was 52°32′N, 29°36′E and 1810 above m.s.l. in summer 2016 \\n(Fig.\\xa01). The experimental field has a deep and uniform silty clay loam soil texture. Experiments were carried out \\nin furrows with lengths of 70\\xa0m  (L1) and 90\\xa0m  (L2), furrow width of 0.75\\xa0m, and longitudinal slope of 0.002. It \\nshould be noted all field experiments were conducted on the bare soil under open-end boundary conditions, and \\nthere is a buffer furrow between experimental furrows. The uniform and constant stream sizes of 0.4 and 0.6\\xa0l/s \\nwere supplied by a typical residential water meter (ISO4064, Brass, ½ inch inlet size, and measuring accuracy \\nof ± 0.1 L at 5–40\\xa0°C).\\nIrrigation methods and practices. \\nTwo stream sizes of 0.4\\xa0l/s  (Q1) and 0.6\\xa0l/s  (Q2) were used to irrigate \\nthe furrows at constant rates. The furrow lengths and stream sizes were chosen based on the standard local lay-\\nout of small farms in the  region37. Furthermore, preliminary trials showed that higher stream sizes induced soil \\nerosion in the furrows. The Washington State College (WSC) flume type 1 was installed at the end of the furrows \\nto measure runoff volume (tail-water). The required irrigation depth was considered 0.05\\xa0m to ensure uniform \\nseed germination and crop establishment according to the current practices in the region recommended by the \\nOffice of Farm Management, School of Agriculture.\\nField data was collected under continuous and surge irrigation. The continuous irrigation was the reference \\nirrigation method with which surge irrigation was compared for irrigation performance subject to the combi-\\nnations of furrow length, stream size, and cycle ratio as the irrigation treatments. The on-time and off-time of \\nthe surge flows were 8\\xa0min and 8\\xa0min, respectively, which resulted in cycle time of 16\\xa0min (CT) and cycle ratio \\n(CR) of 0.5 based on Eqs.\\xa0(1) and (2). The on- and off-times were selected based on a set of preliminary field \\ntests so that at least three surges could be applied to complete the advance phase of the irrigation in the furrows.\\n3\\nVol.:(0123456789)\\nScientific Reports |         (2023) 13:5768  | \\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-32842-8\\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\\nTo determine the advance-recession times along the furrows, the length of all furrows were subdivided into \\n5\\xa0m intervals (stations) and the advance-recession times were monitored and recorded at all stations. Infiltrated \\nwater depth over the soil profile was measured by monitoring soil water content (SWC). The SWC was gravi-\\nmetrically measured using a metal spiral auger down to 100\\xa0cm. The initial SWC was measured before starting the \\nexperiments. Having done the experiments and 48\\xa0h after each irrigation event, the soil samples were collected at \\n20\\xa0cm intervals over soil profile at five soil depths as 0–20, 20–40, 40–60, 60–80, and 80–100\\xa0cm at five selected \\nstations (0, 15, 35, 60 and 70\\xa0m) and at seven selected stations (0, 15, 30, 50, 60, 80 and 90\\xa0m) along the 70\\xa0m \\nand 90\\xa0m furrow lengths, respectively. The soil sampled were immediately weighted at the field (wet weight) and \\nthen were oven-dried at 105\\xa0°C for 24\\xa0h (dry weight) to calculate the gravimetric  SWC38. The volumetric SWC \\nwas calculated by multiplying the soil bulk density (Table\\xa01) by the gravimetric SWC. The volumetric SWC was \\nthen used to calculate the depth of infiltered water through multiplication with the associated soil depth (20\\xa0cm). \\nTable\\xa02 summarizes the field measurement data.\\nInfiltration equations. \\nInfiltration is one of the most sensitive hydraulic parameters affecting surface irri-\\ngation, and is of course one of the most difficult parameters to be determined in the field 31. The Kostiakov-Lewis \\nequation is the widely used equations in determining infiltration parameters as:\\n(1)\\nCT = on − time + oﬀ − time\\n(2)\\nCR = on − time\\nCR\\n(3)\\nZ = ktα + f0t\\nFigure\\xa01.

The base infiltration rate f0 is determined according to Walker and  Skogerboe40 as follows:\\nwhere  Qin and  Qout are the inflow and outflow rate  (m3  min−1), and L is the length of the furrow (m), respectively. \\nIn the two-point method, the advance curve is determined using Eq.\\xa0(5)39,40.\\nwhere p and r are the fitting parameters, and t is the time from the start of inflow to reach station x. Finally, the \\nother two parameters (a and k) are determined using Eqs. (6)–(10).\\nwhere σy is the surface profile shape factor (0.77); σZ is the subsurface profile shape factor; A0 is the wetted area \\nat the upstream  (m2) and  t0.5L and  tL are the advance times (min) at two points, x1 = 0.5L and x2 = L, respectively.\\nThe two-point method is one of the most practical methods for estimating infiltration parameters in surface \\nirrigation because it is mathematically simple and applicable and requires limited  data41. For this reason, many \\nresearchers have also used this method to determine the infiltration parameters in  continuous13,14,31,42,43 and surge \\n irrigation11,28,44. Ismail and  Depeweg11 reported that the two-point method has high accuracy in evaluating the \\ncontiomus and surge irrigation in short-length furrows. However, the two-point method has also some limita-\\ntions. The main limitation is the use of two points in field data collection to estimate infiltration parameters. This \\nmethod has a high sensitivity to advance time  measurement45. For this purpose, Bautista et\\xa0al.41 recommended \\nincreasing the accuracy and measuring more points during the process of data collection. Therefore, in this \\nstudy, we collected the data at all stations completely and continued the process of data collection until the end \\nof the recession phase to reach the f0 that would improve the accuracy of the two-point method in estimating the \\ninfiltration parameters. Moreover, according to Gillies et\\xa0al.46 using the runoff hydrograph rather than a fixed \\nvalue of runoff increases the accuracy of the two-point method in estimating infiltration parameters. Therefore, \\nthe runoff hydrograph was used to evaluate and simulate the irrigation process.\\nIn surge irrigation, soil wetting can be expressed by two independent equations. However, it seems that neither \\nof the equations can properly consider the second wetting because the wetted perimeter changes significantly \\nbetween the first and third cycles. The soil wetting process is described by two independent equation in surge \\nirrigation, both of which consider the first and third cycles as the wetted  perimeter47.

The \\nf0 was measured using Eq.\\xa0(4) when furrows were wetted by the last surge and runoff  started22,45.\\nDetermination of cut‑off time. The parameters of the Kostiakov-Lewis infiltration equations (Eq.\\xa03) were first \\ndetermined in the first set of furrows based on the Elliot and  Walker39. For this purpose, eight experimental \\nfurrows were used to measure the infiltration parameters of the Kostiakov-Lewis equation (a combination of \\nstream size of 0.4\\xa0l/s\\xa0and 0.6\\xa0l/s and furrow lengths of 70\\xa0m\\xa0and 90\\xa0m under continuous and surge irrigation \\nmethods). Table\\xa03 shows the field-measured parameters a, k and f0. Then, in the second adjacent set of furrows, \\nthe advance-recession times, infiltrated water depth, volume of applied water, and runoff hydrograph were mon-\\nitored and measured for irrigation performance analyses based on addressing the required irrigation depth of \\n Zreq = 0.05\\xa0m at the end of the  furrows40,48. Determination of cutoff time is important for addressing the required \\ninfiltrated depth. Cutoff time in every furrow of the second set was calculated according to Eqs. (11) and (12). \\nDue to different cutoff times, the total volume of applied water in each furrow  (Vin,  m3) was different (Table\\xa02) \\nbecause  Ta and  Tz differed.\\nwhere Ta is advance time, Tco is cutoff time, and TZ is opportunity time and a, k and f0 given Table\\xa03. Since the unit \\nof Zreq is  m3  m−1, the required amount of applied water of 0.05\\xa0m was multiplied by the furrow width as 0.75\\xa0m.\\nIt is noteworthy that conducting the experiment on two sets of furrows would consider soil spatial variability \\nand its likely effect on the variability of infiltration  parameters49,50. Although infiltration may change because of \\nspatial  variability51 and the changes could be even in many orders of magnitude within short  distances52, former \\nstudies on the experimental field showed that the spatial infiltration variability was  negligible53,54. Nevertheless, \\nbecause of the time gap between the former researches in 2002 and this research, our further confirmatory \\nfield-based analyses showed that the application of the parameterized infiltration equations obtained under \\na combination of stream size (Q) and furrow length (L) did not reveal high spatial variability in infiltration, \\nand the measurements done in different furrows resulted in nearly similar estimated infiltrated water depth, \\n Zparametrized (Fig.\\xa02). In this regard, Trout and  Mackey55, after extensive field measurements, reported that the \\nfurrow-to-furrow infiltration variability is basically due to uneven tractor and implement wheel compaction of \\nfurrows, which was not the case in our small experimental field. In addition, according to a detailed soil survey \\nin the study  area56, the soil texture of the experimental site is uniform, which also confirms the lack of influential \\ninfiltration  variability49.\\nModels’ description and application. \\nWinSRFR model. The WinSRFR model is a software pack-\\nage for hydraulic analysis of surface irrigation systems, developed by the Agricultural Research Service of the \\nUnited States Department of  Agriculture57,58. WinSRFR is the combination of three earlier models:  BORDER59, \\n BASIN60, and  SRFR61. The WinSRFR is built based on four analytical functionalities namely; Event Analysis, \\nSimulation, Physical Design, and Operations Analysis. In this study, Event Analysis and Simulation were used to \\ncalibrate the model, and then to simulate and evaluate the performance of the continuous and surge irrigations, \\n respectively58. The zero-inertia model was used for simulation and evaluation of furrow irrigation in WinSRFR \\nversion 5.158 due to open-ended boundary conditions and low slopes in furrows.\\nAccording to Ojaghlou et\\xa0al.28, surge irrigation affects the infiltration process differently from continuous \\nirrigation.

For this purpose, the concept of Cycle Ratio-Time Model (CRTM) of Blair \\nand  Smerdon47 has been used in the WinSRFR. The concept of CRTM is that the infiltration rate continues to \\ndecrease during the off-time, just as if water was flowing  continuously47. Hence, the opportunity time at any point \\nis a function of the total  time58. The option can be practically used with any infiltration formulation. We therefore \\nused the Kostiakov-Lewis infiltration equation for simulating the surge irrigation in WinSRFR.\\nSIRMOD model. The SIRMOD model was first developed at Utah State University in 1987, and its latest version \\nwas proposed in  200562. The SIRMOD simulates all surface irrigation methods, including furrow, border, and \\nbasin irrigation systems on the field, and helps in the evaluation and simulation of physical design and inflow \\nvariables. The most important influential parameters in SIRMOD are basic infiltration rate, stream size, cycle \\non-time, and cycle  ratio11. Similar to WinSRFR, the zero-inertia model was used in simulating with SIRMOD.\\nFor simulation of surge irrigation in SIRMOD, the first cycle (as a dry, continuous condition) and the third \\ncycle (as wet, intermittent flow condition) are used to estimate the infiltration parameters by the two-point \\nmethod as recommended by Ismail and  Depeweg11, Horst et\\xa0al.18, and Ojaghlou et\\xa0al.28. The resulting equations \\nare:\\nwhere Zc and Zs are the infiltrated volumes per unit furrow length  (m3  m−1) for continuous (dry) and intermit-\\ntent flow (wet) conditions, respectively. The k, k’, a, a’, f0 and f0’ are the empirical parameters that depend on the \\nsoil type and the effect of cycled wetting and drying, and τ is the cumulative opportunity time over all the surges \\n applied11. The infiltration in the second cycle is described by a transition function as described in Walker and \\n Humpherys63, Ismail and  Depeweg11 and Horst et\\xa0al.18.\\nCalibration of infiltration parameters using WinSRFR and SIRMOD. \\nThe calibration of the infil-\\ntration equations by WinSRFR and SIRMOD was done by the trial-and-error14,64. To calibrate the continu-\\nous irrigation in SIRMOD, the initially field-measured values of the non-conservative parameters a, k, and f0 \\nwere fine-tuned and calibrated. However, the Manning roughness coefficient (n = 0.04) was considered as a \\nconservative parameters without any change. Then by changing the infiltration coefficients in an acceptable \\nrange (NRMSE < 10%), the match between the measured and simulated advance-recession times, infiltrated \\nwater depth, and runoff were assessed. To calibrate the infiltration parameters in surge irrigation in SIRMOD, \\nthe measured infiltration equations from the first and third cycles were calibrated. The values of the calibrated \\nparameters in SIRMOD were determined by trial and error to find the best match between the measured and \\nsimulated advance-recession  times18,65 (Table\\xa04).\\nTo calibrate the non-conservative infiltration parameters for the continuous irrigation in the WinSRFR, \\nMerriam and  Keller66 method was chosen under the Event Analysis world  option14,43. In this regard, the field-\\nmeasured values of a and f0 were set as non-conservative infiltration parameters. Then by changing a and f0 the \\nmatch between the measured and simulated advance-recession times, infiltrated water depth, and runoff was \\nassessed (NRMSE < 10%), and if the match values were poor, then new values of a and f0 would be tested.\\nBecause of the inability of the Event Analysis world of WinSRFR to evaluate surge irrigation, the Simulation \\nworld was used to calibrate the infiltration parameters of surge irrigation. Besides, as the Merriam-Keller method \\nuses runoff in the simulation and there is no runoff in the first surge under surge irrigation, the Merriam-Keller \\nmethod cannot be used to calibrate the infiltration parameters of surge irrigation. It should also be noted that \\nto calibrate the infiltration parameters of surge irrigation in the Simulation world, the infiltration parameters a \\n(13)\\nZc = kτ a + f0τ\\n(14)\\nZs = k′τ a′ + f\\n′\\n0τ\\nFigure\\xa02.

The values of the calibrated parameters in WinSRFR were deter-\\nmined by trial and error to find the best match between the measured and simulated advance-recession times \\nand infiltrated water depth (Table\\xa04).\\nIrrigation performance indices. \\nFour irrigation performance indices were used to analyze the irrigation \\nperformance including application efficiency (AE), distribution uniformity (DU), deep percolation (DP), and \\ntail-water ratio (TWR )12. It is noteworthy that irrigation method performance is generally assessed using the \\ndistribution uniformity index, while the irrigation management performance is assessed with the application \\nefficiency or the fraction of beneficial water  use4.\\nwhere Dad, Dap, Dmin, Davg, Ddp, and Dro are the depth of total water stored in the 1\\xa0m soil profile over the furrow \\nlength (mm); depth of water applied to the furrow (mm); minimum depth of infiltrated water (mm); the average \\ndepth of infiltrated water over the furrow length (mm), depth of deep percolated water (mm), and the depth of \\nrunoff (mm), respectively.\\nEvaluation of irrigation models. \\nIn order to evaluate the performance of the SIRMOD and WinSRFR \\nmodels in simulating the observed field data of advance and recession times, and infiltrated water depths, the \\nNormalized Root Mean Squared Error (NRMSE)67, the refined Willmott Index of Agreement (dr)68, and the \\nNash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NS)69 which is also known as Model Efficiency were used. The runoff vol-\\nume was assessed by the Relative Error (RE) because we had only one observed value of the total runoff volume \\nand one value for the simulated runoff volume by each model.

IntroductionFresh water scarcity is presently affecting arid and semi-aridcountries (i.e. about 2 billion people) and it is reasonably expectedthat in the next few decades a larger part of the world’s populationwill experience this problem, because of the combination ofclimate change, industrial development and population growth(Vo¨ro¨smarty et al., 2000). The agricultural sector, which accountsfor about the 70% of the actual global water withdrawal (see Kijne,2003), may thus face frequent water shortages, even in the midlatitudes. Efﬁcient planning and management of agricultural waterresources is thus an unavoidable task, which requires, in turn, anaccurate modelling of the water stored in the root zone of cropsand, thus, of the irrigation water demand. The former is the so-called ‘green water’ (Falkenmark, 1991), as opposed to the ‘bluewater’ of lakes, rivers and groundwater stores.The artiﬁcial process of water distribution and application toagricultural ﬁelds isintrinsicallydistributedin nature, anddistributed hydrological modelling approaches, despite their hugedata demand, are generally employed for the simulation of the soilwater dynamics in the vadose zone. A number of distributed-parameter models have become available for this purpose, eitherphysically based (see, for instance, Ahrends et al., 2008; van Damet al., 2008; Sudicky et al., 2006; Voss and Provost, 2002; Singh et al.,1999), or conceptual (Niswonger et al., 2006; Arnold and Fohrer,2005; Neitsch et al., 2002; Bergstro¨m, 1995; Refsgaard and Storm,1995; Young et al., 1989). Despite the large improvements inprocessor speed, both types of models are still characterized by asevere computational effort. The number of simulations that ispossible to produce is in practice limited, which is one of the reasonswhy decision makers ask for scenario (or what-if) analysis evenwhen the formulation of an optimal decision-making problemwould be more appropriate. In fact, when dealing with planning ormanagement problems (e.g. the design of a reservoir release policyserving a cultivated area or the optimal allocation of water amongdifferent crops), these models are unusable, since their statedimensions are such that optimization algorithms would requirebillions of years to determine the optimal solution. This statementmay appear to overstate the case, while in fact it is understates it. Toverify it, consider the case of a single reservoir that supplies anirrigation district. When the system is modelled by discretizing thereservoir storage with 10 values and representing the district withan a priori given trajectory of the water demand, the design of arelease policy requires about 1 min on a good desktop computer.When the irrigation system is described by a distributed-parametermodel with 10,000 state variables (each one discretized with 10values), the computing time for the same design turns out to be1010;000 min,since the computing time growsexponentially withthestate dimensions (this is the so-called ‘curse of dimensionality’, seeSection 2.1). To feel what 1010;000 min are, note that from the BigBang until now only 1016 min have elapsed.In order to make optimal decision-making problems actuallytractable, it is therefore necessary to resort to computationallyefﬁcient models, such as lumped-parameter models.

This paper, with the aim of improving the quality of theselatter, introduces a new approach for their design. This approach is based on metamodelling, whichproposes to identify a simple, lumped-parameter model on the basis of the data produced via simulationwith a distributed-parameter model. The approach proposed is tested on a real-world case study, namelythe identiﬁcation of a metamodel describing the water demand of the Muzza–Bassa Lodigiana irrigationdistrict (Italy). The metamodel, which inherits the physical description of the original distributed-parameter model, is sufﬁciently simple to permit the resolution of an optimal control problem, i.e. thedesign, via stochastic dynamic programming, of the release policy of Lake Como, serving the Muzzairrigation district. 2009 Elsevier B.V.

All rights reserved.doi:10.1016/j.agwat.2009.09.007model can easily be obtained for the dynamics of the storage in areservoir or of the inﬂow to a reservoir from the contributingcatchment: the ﬁrst is well represented by a mass balance equationand the second by empirical models, e.g. an Auto Regressive MovingAverage eXogenous (ARMAX) model or a Data Based Mechanistic(DBM) model (see Soncini-Sessa et al., 2007), since long time seriesof measured inﬂows are commonly available. The water demand ofan irrigation district cannot be treated with this approach, because itis intrinsically distributed in space and measurement is stillimpractical (Schiermeier, 2008); therefore the identiﬁcation ofempirical models is generally precluded for cultivated areas. It isthen common practice to employ lumped-parameter, conceptualmodels. Vedula and Mujumdar (1992); Vedula and Kumar (1996)and Ghahraman and Sepaskhah (2002) used, for example, a simplesoil water balance for the design, via Stochastic Dynamic Program-ming (SDP), of a reservoir release policy under a multiple cropsscenario. Shangguan et al. (2002) employed a similar balanceequation for optimizing the allocation of irrigation water resourceson a regional scale. The main drawback of this modelling approachconsists in the absence of any calibration and in the large number ofsimpliﬁcations it requires.In order to overcome these limitations, an attractive approach isthe combined use of distributed-parameter and lumped-para-meter models: granted that the former cannot be directlyemployed in optimization problems, it seems reasonable toemploy the detailed outputs they provide for the improvementof the lumped-parameter models’ quality. This can be achievedwith techniques based on metamodelling. A metamodel is asimple, computationally efﬁcient model that is identiﬁed on adata-set produced by simulating a large, distributed-parameter,physicallybasedorconceptualmodel.Metamodelling,ﬁrstintroduced by Blanning (1975), is a well-known technique inmechanical and aerospace engineering (see Queipo et al., 2005, fora recent review), where it is widely employed to make optimiza-tion studies feasible. In relation to agricultural systems, the onlyﬁeld where metamodelling has already been applied and reportedin the literature is the analysis of diffuse pollution in arable soils.One of the ﬁrst applications was by Bouzaher et al. (1993), whodeveloped a metamodel to predict the groundwater concentrationof herbicides for a scenario analysis. Børgesen et al. (2001) andHaberlandt et al. (2002) employed a linear regression metamodeland a fuzzy-rule-based metamodel for the estimation of nitrogenleaching on a regional scale. To the authors’ knowledge, apart froma recent work by van Walsum and Groenendijk (2008) concerningsimulation efﬁciency, there are no reported applications ofmetamodelling to the estimation of the dynamics of irrigationwater demand in cultivated areas.The purpose of this paper is to introduce metamodelling in theﬁeld of agricultural water management and to test the design of ametamodel of a large, distributed-parameter, conceptual model(simply distributed-parameter model in the following), whichdescribes the irrigation water demand of the Muzza district,located south-east of Milan (Italy) and fed by the River Adda (theLake Como efﬂuent). The goal of the metamodelling exercise is tostrongly reduce the state dimensionality of the distributed-parameter model, i.e. to replace the distributed-parameter, two-layer, bucket model with a lumped-parameter, one-layer, bucketmodel, which can be subsequently employed to design, via SDP, theLake Como release policy.Even if the case we consider concerns the real-time control(management) of a reservoir, the approach we propose can be usedfor planning problems as well. For this reason, in the next sectionwe describe how to use metamodelling within a planning/management problem and we set out the procedure we adoptedto identify the metamodel. Section 3 presents the distributed-parameter model. Section 4 concerns the design of the metamodel.In Section 5 we brieﬂy present the results that can be achieved bycontrolling the system with the designed release policy and wesubsequently re-validate the metamodel on the trajectoriesobtained. In Section 6 we draw some conclusions on this work.2. Metamodelling within planning/management problemsIn the ﬁrst part of this section, we introduce a procedure forusing metamodelling within a planning/management problem bydescribing the management problem (the design of a reservoirrelease policy) that we will actually solve in the following sections.Then we will immediately see how the procedure can bestraightforwardly extended to planning problems. In the secondpart, we describe the procedure that we employed for theidentiﬁcation of the metamodel. The reader interested in a surveyof metamodelling techniques may usefully consider Simpson et al.(2001) or Queipo et al. (2005).2.1. Design procedureThe optimal management of a water system, composed of areservoir serving an irrigation district, requires us to design arelease policy that (daily) suggests the amount of water to bereleased, given the reservoir storage and the irrigation waterdemand. The most efﬁcient and consolidated approach for suchdesign is based on the formulation and resolution of an OptimalControl Problem (OCP). Among the different methods that can beadopted for solving this kind of OCP, SDP is by far the most used(see Soncini-Sessa et al., 2007; or Castelletti et al., 2008b, for recentreviews of this topic). The main limit of SDP is that itscomputational requirements grow exponentially with the dimen-sion of the state vector, so that, even when adopting the mostadvanced approaches (see, for example, Castelletti et al., 2008a),only few state variables can be used to model the water system.In order to make the OCP practically solvable, the dynamics of allthe water system components must thus be described with lumped-parameter models. As pointed out in Section 1, the reservoir storageand the inﬂow from the catchment can be easily and effectivelydescribed with this kind of model. As far as the dynamics of theirrigation water demand is concerned, the common approach (seeGhahraman and Sepaskhah, 2002, and references therein) consistsin employing a lumped-parameter, conceptual model (i.e. a simplesoil–water balance). Our proposal is to resort to a metamodel, whichis a lumped-parameter, empirical model, identiﬁed on the dataproduced via simulation with a distributed-parameter model. Thismetamodel must present a small dimension of the state vector, sothat the design of a reservoir release policy can be performedthrough the resolution of the OCP via SDP.The design procedure we propose is shown in Fig. 1. In Phase Athe metamodel is identiﬁed and validated on an Input–Output (I–O) data-set suitably designed via simulation with the distributed-parameter model (we will analyze this phase in greater detail inSection 2.2). Then (Phase B) the release policy is designed bysolving an OCP, where the irrigation district dynamics is describedwith the metamodel. In Phase C the behavior of the water systemcontrolled by the designed policy is simulated. In so doing, theirrigation district dynamics is described with the distributed-parameter model, and not with the metamodel, in order to obtaintrajectories of its input and output over the simulation horizon, onthe basis of which the metamodel can be validated for the secondtime (Phase D). If the performance measures are low, it means thatthe metamodel explanatory capacity is weak in the region of the I–O space where the system is driven by the designed policy. It is thusnecessarytore-calibratethemetamodelbyaddingthesetrajectories to the calibration data-set considered in Phase A. Onthe contrary, if the validation is satisfactory, the procedure ends.S. Galelli et al. / Agricultural Water Management 97 (2010) 187–200188The reader can easily note that the resolution of the manage-ment problem (policy design) in Phase B can be straightforwardlysubstituted by the resolution of a planning problem (e.g. theoptimal allocation of water among different crops), withoutaffecting the rest of the procedure. Both management and planningproblems, indeed, base their resolution on the use of optimizationalgorithms, which, in their turn, can actually be applied only whenthe state dimension of the model is low, i.e. a lumped-parametermodel is used to describe the dynamics of the system we want tomanage or plan.2.2. Metamodel identiﬁcation procedureIn order to identify the metamodel, we adopted the procedureshown on the right-hand side of Fig. 1. It is partially based on themethodology presented by Kleijnen and Sargent (2000). As iscurrent practice in metamodelling, the procedure is valid for aMulti Input–Single Output (MISO) metamodel, because it permitsus to build a metamodel emulating the dynamics of the variable weare interested in. When more variables are to be emulated (let’s sayn), i.e. when a Multi Input–Multi Output (MIMO) metamodel mustbe identiﬁed, the procedure can be applied n times, one for eachMISO metamodel. Let us present the contents of each step.A.1 The distributed-parameter model is analyzed, with the aim ofgaining knowledge of the physics of the system it describes andexpressing this knowledge with a causal network, which willbe used in the following steps.A.2 The metamodel output, namely the distributed-parametermodel variable that we want to emulate, is deﬁned. Thedeﬁnition is obviously based on the metamodel goal: in thepresent application, for example, in order to design the LakeFig. 1. The procedure for the design of a release policy using metamodelling and SDP. On the right-hand side an explosion of Phase A concerning the identiﬁcation of themetamodel.S. Galelli et al. / Agricultural Water Management 97 (2010) 187–200189Como release policy, we need to forecast the one-step-aheadirrigation water demand of the Muzza district. Operationally,the deﬁnition consists in establishing the spatial and timedomain on which some of the distributed-parameter modelvariables (eventually) have to be aggregated into one singlevariable,namelythemetamodeloutput.Thechoiceofthespatialdomain can be based on physical considerations or on clusteringtechniques (see Jain et al., 1999, for a review of the principalcluster analysis methods), while the temporal domain dependson the relative size of the decision time-step and of thesimulation time-step adopted in the distributed-parametermodel. Finally, the range of variability of the metamodel outputcan be derived from physical considerations (as in our case) orthrough simulation (stepA.4). This last information will turn outto be useful in the release policy design (Phase C).A.3 One has to identify, through the causal network, those inputvariables that affect the metamodel output. When they turnout to be too many, one has to identify the most important onethrough physical considerations or data-driven techniques(e.g. correlation analysis). If the selected input variables arespatially and temporally distributed, they must be aggregatedwith the same spatial and temporal resolution adopted for themetamodel output, so that consistency is maintained betweenthe deﬁnition of the output and input variables. The spatial andtemporal aggregation, moreover, permits us to strongly reducethe number of input variables.A.4 This step is known in the metamodelling literature asExperimental Design (ED) or Design of Experiments (DOE)and its concern is to produce, via simulation with thedistributed-parameter model, an I–O data-set. This set willbe split into two sub-sets to be used for calibrating andvalidating the metamodel in the next step. The DOE aims atexploring the I–O space while considering the computationalburden induced by each simulation with the distributed-parameter model. It can possibly be based on statisticaltechniques (for a recent review, see Kleijnen et al., 2005).A.5 The class of models (e.g. autoregressive-exogenous or data-based mechanistic models, splines or neural networks, etc.) towhich the metamodel will belong is ﬁrst chosen. Then, themetamodel form (e.g. the number of neurons and hidden layersof a neural network) within the selected class is speciﬁed.Finally, the metamodelparametersare estimated witha suitablealgorithm. If the performance measures (e.g. the coefﬁcient ofdetermination R2) on the calibration data-set are satisfactory,one proceeds to the next phase; otherwise, the form or the classof the metamodel is changed and the step repeated.A.6 If the metamodel provides satisfactory performance measuresalso on the validation data-set, it can be considered valid on thedesigned I–O space. The metamodel can then be used in theOCP for the design of the reservoir release policy. If theperformance measures are not satisfactory, it is necessary toreturn to the previous step, considering a different form orclass for the metamodel.3. The Muzza distributed-parameter modelThe Muzza–Bassa Lodigiana district is located in the PadanaPlain (Italy), south-east of the city of Milan. It has an area of about700 km2 and irrigation is practised there with the border method(or free-surface ﬂooding). The cultivated area covers 85% of thewhole district; major crops are cereals (especially maize) andpermanent grass. The source of the irrigation supply is the Muzzamain canal, which originates from the River Adda, the Lake Comoefﬂuent. The irrigation supply is thus controlled by the releasefrom the lake, which is regulated through the Olginate dam. Aschematic view of the whole system is given in Fig. 2.A series of signiﬁcant droughts in the last ten years hasincreased interest in water savings and attention has been paid tothe water losses produced when the ﬂow diverted into the Muzzamain canal is higher than the irrigation water demand (and the netdiverted ﬂow is thus higher than the irrigation supply), as, forinstance, happens during precipitation events. These losses couldbe decreased by designing a lake release policy that depends notonly on the lake storage, but also on the actual irrigation demand.However, the Muzza district’s gravity ﬂow canals are characterizedby high inertia, which does not permit us to change their ﬂowrapidly in order to follow the rapid ﬂuctuation of the irrigationwater demand. As a consequence, the implementation of a releasepolicy based on-demand requires a modiﬁcation of the canals, suchthat they can be regulated on-demand (it is for this reason that thelake regulator presently tends to track a target demand: an a priorigiven trajectory of the water demand).This is a strong issue in canal management, and some recentpapers (notably Mareels et al., 2005) showed that the rehabilitationof open canal conveyance and distribution networks of largeirrigation districts can be such that they can be practically regulatedon-demand. This is obtained by combining the classical use ofregulation structures (gates), in order to transform the gravity ﬂowcanals into a cascade of pools, with sensors and control algorithms tooperate automatically all the structures. The routing and schedulingof water is then realized through an automatic adjustment of thegates.Withthismodiﬁcation, withinthelimitofafractionofthepoolcapacity, a water volume appears to be shifted along the canalswith a velocity that is not the water velocity (about 2 km/h in theFig. 2. Schematic view of Lake Como, its efﬂuent (the River Adda) and the pilot studybasin (the Muzza district).S. Galelli et al. / Agricultural Water Management 97 (2010) 187–200190Muzza district case), but the celerity of the backward surfaceperturbations,1 generated by the gates’ movement. The inertia of thecanals is thus strongly reduced and, within limits imposed by thevolume of the smallest pool, the irrigation demand can be satisﬁedalmost in real time.Since our policy design problem needs to be combined with on-demand regulation of canals, two assumptions were made inbuilding the distributed-parameter model. First, it was assumedthat the modiﬁcation of the canals is such that their inertiabecomes negligible, which means that their ﬂow can be consideredof the plug-ﬂow type. This does not mean that the canals’ capacityis unlimited, but that their ﬂow can be varied almost instanta-neously and thus quickly adapted to the fast-varying irrigationwater demand. Second, it was assumed that the transport time isnull, since, considering the Muzza district’s size, the decision time-step of the management problem (1 day) is deﬁnitely larger thanthe time required for a released volume to reach the most distantﬁeld in the district. These two assumptions together imply that thevolume released from the lake is delivered to the crops in a timethat is shorter than the decision time step, which means that thecanal dynamic does not have to be considered. Therefore, themodelling effort was concentrated on the hydrological waterbalance in the district.3.1. The modelThe model implemented for the Muzza district is a large,distributed-parameter,conceptualmodel,whichallowsthesimulation of the irrigation water distribution and the computa-tion of the hydrologic balance in the root zone in the whole districton a daily basis. The model includes a number of modules, devotedto speciﬁc tasks: water sources, conveyance and distribution, soil–crop water balance.The water balance module (Facchi et al., 2004) accounts for thespace variability of soils and crops, as well as of meteorological andirrigation inputs, by subdividing the irrigation district with aregular mesh: soil and crop characteristics as well as meteor-ological inputs and irrigation supply are homogeneous in each cellof the mesh but may vary from cell to cell. Each individual cellidentiﬁes a soil volume which extends from the soil surface to thelower limit of the root zone, and a one-dimensional representationof the hydrological processes is adopted within it. The soil volumeof each cell is subdivided into two layers: the upper one(evaporative layer) represents the upper 15 cm of the soil; thebottom one (transpirative layer) represents the root zone and has atime-varying depth ZðiÞr;t. The two layers are modelled as two non-linear reservoirs in cascade (see Fig. 3). The water percolating outof the bottom layer constitutes the recharge to the groundwatersystem.The dynamics of the water content UðiÞ1;t [mm] in the evaporative(ﬁrst) layer of the i-th cell is governed by the following balanceequation:UðiÞ1;tþ1 ¼ UðiÞ1;t þ RðiÞtþ1  IðiÞtþ1  QðiÞr;tþ1  EðiÞtþ1  QðiÞu;tþ1 þ QðiÞi;tþ1(1)where RðiÞtþ1[mm] is the rainfall, IðiÞtþ1[mm] is the canopyinterception, QðiÞr;tþ1 [mm] is the net runoff from the cell, EðiÞtþ1[mm] is the evaporation, QðiÞu;tþ1 [mm] is the outﬂow to thetranspirative layer and QðiÞi;tþ1 [mm] is the irrigation supply, all in thetime interval ½t; t þ 1Þ.2A similar equation holds for the dynamics of the water contentUðiÞ2;t [mm] (the so-called green water) in the transpirative (second)layerUðiÞ2;tþ1 ¼ UðiÞ2;t þ QðiÞu;tþ1  TðiÞtþ1  QðiÞd;tþ1(2)where TðiÞtþ1 [mm] is the transpiration and QðiÞd;tþ1 [mm] is the outﬂowfrom the root zone to the groundwater system, both in the timeinterval ½t; t þ 1Þ.The evaporation EðiÞtþ1 and the transpiration TðiÞtþ1, in Eqs. (1) and(2) respectively, are computed using the FAO-56 dual cropcoefﬁcient method (Allen et al., 1998): the evaporation EðiÞtþ1 isdetermined by multiplying the reference crop evapotranspirationET0ðiÞtþ1 [mm] (computed with the FAO-Penman–Monteith equa-tion) by the evaporative coefﬁcient KðiÞe;t [–] (which depends on UðiÞ1;t).The transpiration TðiÞtþ1 is obtained by multiplying ET0ðiÞcoefﬁcients. The ﬁrst is the water stress coefﬁcient KðiÞ tþ1 by twos;t [–] (whosevalue depends on UðiÞ2;t), which expresses the effect of limited soilwater availability; the second is the basal coefﬁcient KðiÞcb [–], whichaccounts for the differences in the crop canopy and aerodynamicresistances relative to the reference crop. It follows thatTðiÞtþ1 ¼ KðiÞs;t ðUðiÞ2;tÞ  KðiÞcb  ET0ðiÞtþ1(3)By observing that the product KðiÞcb  ET0ðiÞtþ1is the potentialtranspiration TðiÞc;tþ1 [mm] (i.e. the crop transpiration in thecondition of optimal water content) we can rewrite Eq. (3) asfollows:TðiÞtþ1 ¼ KðiÞs;t ðUðiÞ2;tÞ  TðiÞc;tþ1(4)Drainage discharges QðiÞu;tþ1 and QðiÞd;tþ1 are determined using asimpliﬁed scheme, similar to those used in other models (e.g.ANSWERS2000, Bouraoui et al., 1997; EPIC, Williams et al., 1984),which consider a Darcian-type gravity ﬂow in the unsaturated soil(Gandolﬁ et al., 2006).The runoff rate QðiÞr;tþ1 in Eq. (1) is calculated by using the SCS-Curve Number method (USDA-SCS, 1972, 1986), which is used foragricultural areas by models like AGNPS (Young et al., 1989) andAQUACROP (Steduto et al., 2009). The canopy interception IðiÞtþ1 isevaluated by the Braden formula (Braden, 1985), as a function ofthe leaf area index, the cover fraction and the volume capacity perunit foliage area, which are variable according to the crop type andthe growing stage. Storm runoff, as well as irrigation tail-waters,are collected by the drainage network and may eventuallycomplement the supply QðiÞi;tþ1 to cells of downstream units.Fig. 3. Sketch of the processes being modelled in the ith cell by the distributed-parameter model. The signiﬁcance of the symbols and of the arrows is explainedwithin Section 3.1.1 This celerity is equal to ðﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃg  hp vÞ, where g is the gravitational acceleration, his the water depth in the canal and v is the ﬂow velocity. Considering a depth h of1.5–3.0 m, for instance, the celerity is about 12–18 km/h.2 The subscript in the symbol of a state variables, as UðiÞ1;t, denotes the time atwhich its value is considered, while the subscript of a ﬂow variable, as RðiÞtþ1, denotesthe termination time of the period in which the ﬂow occurs.S. Galelli et al. / Agricultural Water Management 97 (2010) 187–200191During the irrigation season (1 April to 31 October) the waterﬂow qMuzzatþ1[m3/s] diverted from the River Adda into the Muzzamain canal, which is the only water source, is delivered to thedistrict. The water available for irrigation (simply net diverted ﬂowin the following) is equal to the diverted ﬂow qMuzzatþ1multiplied bythe conveyance and distribution efﬁciency h. Due to the hypothesisthat gates will be placed in the canals, in order to regulate them on-demand, propagation processes within the network were notconsidered in the model. Regulation on-demand implies that anirrigation application occurs (i.e. the daily irrigation supply QðiÞi;tþ1 isnon-zero) only when two conditions are satisﬁed.First, the soil moisture deﬁcit DðiÞ2;t [mm] (deﬁned as the ﬁeldcapacity UðiÞ2; fc [mm] minus the soil water content UðiÞ2;t) is higherthan a threshold valueDðiÞ2;t >a  RAWðiÞt(5)where a is a coefﬁcient lower than 1 and RAWðiÞt[mm] is the soilwater content readily available to the crop (Allen et al., 1998).Eq. (5) can be rewritten asUðiÞ2;t < UðiÞ2; fc  a  RAWðiÞt(6)and therefore the ﬁrst condition requires that the soil watercontent UðiÞ2;t in the transpirative layer fall below the thresholdUðiÞr;t ¼ UðiÞ2; fc  a  RAWðiÞt[mm].The second condition is that the irrigation system can providewater to irrigate the cell. When QðiÞi;tþ1 is non-zero, its value wasassumed to be 180 mm/day for each cell in the district (thequantity averagely used for the border method).The description of the water conveyance and distributionreﬂects the typical structure of the irrigation network in mostdistricts of the Padana plain. The district is subdivided into anumber of units that receive irrigation supply from one or moresources. During the irrigation season, water derived from thesources is conveyed to the units and each of them receives a ﬁxedshare of the ﬂow that is diverted from the sources supplying thatspeciﬁc unit through the irrigation network. In practice anincidence matrix is used to represent the links between thesources and the units, and two numerical values are associatedwith each active link: the fraction of the diverted discharge whichis conveyed to the unit and the conveyance efﬁciency. At themoment, the module does not fully account for ﬂow propagationprocesses within the channels of the irrigation network, as onlytime delays between diversion and delivery can be taken intoaccount. Once water is delivered to a unit, distribution within theunit takes place either on a demand basis or on a rotation basis; inthe latter case, in each day a ﬁxed number of cells is explored tocheck if irrigation is required and a cell is actually irrigated only ifthe soil water content, provided by the soil volume balance model,is below a given threshold. The number of explored cells is afunction rotation period (turn), which is a characteristic of eachunit and may vary within the district depending mainly on soil andcrop types. Irrigation tail-waters from a unit are collected by thedrainage network and may complement the water supply todownstream units.3.2. Model inputs and calibrationThe model inputs are the time series of the average daily ﬂowdiverted by the water sources and of the following meteorologicalvariables: rainfall, maximum and minimum temperature, windspeed, maximum and minimum relative humidity, solar radiation(simply meteorological inputs in the following). Meteorologicalinputs must be available for a number of stations that is sufﬁcientto account for the spatial variability of the variables within thedistrict. Spatial interpolation of the daily values in the differentstations is carried out inside the model.Given the land use and the input series, the model computes thecorresponding daily time series of the water balance terms for eachcell of the basin. The irrigation demand of the district is computed ineach day as the sum of the irrigation demands of all the cells wheresoil water content is below the threshold deﬁned in Eq. (6). Modelimplementation for the Muzza district was based on a carefulcollection and collation of all the available physiographic, meteor-ological and hydrometricdata,as well as on a thorough investigationof the irrigation management rules and criteria. The Muzza canal isthe only source of irrigation supply and, through a network ofsmaller channels, conveys water to 65 irrigation units. The divertedﬂow is distributed among the units, each receiving a ﬁxed share ofthe total ﬂow. Time series of the Muzza ﬂow and of themeteorological variables in six agro-meteorological stations wereavailable for the period 1993-2004. Land use maps were obtainedfrom the Agricultural Agency of the Lombardia Region, whichpublishes yearly digital maps of the main crops, derived from thefarmers’landusestatementsforCAPpayments.Thecropparameters(crop coefﬁcient, leaf area index, root depth, and crop height) wereobtained by combining different literature references: Po RiverAuthority (PRA, 1998), Baldoni and Giardini (1982), Huygen et al.(1997), Allen et al. (1998), and USDA-SCS (1972, 1986). The durationof the phenological phases for each crop was adapted from(Donatelli, 1995; Stockle and Nelson, 1996), using local observa-tions. Soil parameters were derived from the 1:250,000 pedologicalmap of the district, which includes 60 main pedological units,combined with ﬁeld observations of the physico-chemical char-acteristics of the soil proﬁles which are representative of each unit.The para', 'unique_identifier': 177}\n",

Raghuwanshi4Abstract: The success of irrigation system operation and planning depends on the quantiﬁcation of supply and demand and equitabledistribution of supply to meet the demand if possible, or to minimize the gap between the supply and demand. Most of the irrigationliterature mainly focuses on the demand and distribution aspects only. In addition, irrigation projects that receive water from a reservoircan be challenging to manage as annual ﬂuctuations in runoff from the reservoir’s catchment can have considerable impact on theirrigation management strategy. This study focuses on the development of an integrated reservoir-based canal irrigation model IRCIMthat includes catchment hydrologic modeling, reservoir water balance, command hydrologic modeling, and a rotational canal irrigationmanagement system. The front end of the IRCIM is developed in Visual Basic 6.0, whereas the back-end coding is done in C language.The graphical user interface is the most important feature of the model, as it provides a better interaction between the model and its user.The IRCIM has a modular structure that consists of three modules, viz., catchment module, reservoir module, and crop water demandmodule. The catchment module predicts daily runoff from the catchment that inﬂows to the reservoir. Depending on the data availability,this module is provided with the ﬂexibility of choosing between the Soil Conservation Service’s curve number method combined with theMuskingum routing technique, and an artiﬁcial neural network technique using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm. The reservoir moduleis based on conservation of mass approach, and results in daily reservoir storage. The crop water demand module is comprised ofwater-balance models for both paddy and ﬁeld crops. The irrigation management system serves as the program ﬂow controller for themodel and runs the required module when needed. For postseason evaluation of the irrigation system, performance indicators such asadequacy, efﬁciency, equity, and dependability are used.

During the last two decades, irrigation’s steady boomhas begun to wane. The global irrigation base is unlikely to growfaster than 0.6% /year over the next 25 years Postel 1999. How-ever, with increasing municipal and industrial needs, its share ofwater is likely to go down. Thus, in the future, irrigation has tobecome efﬁcient and produce more with less water.India continues to be an agriculture-intensive country withover 70% of population living in rural areas. Steering the overallgrowth of the economy, the agriculture sector contributes 22% tothe gross domestic product AIC 2006. The gradual expansion inirrigation development has played a signiﬁcant role in strength-ening the Indian economy. India has made considerable progressas far as creation of irrigation potential the gross area whichcould theoretically be irrigated in a year on the basis of the as-sumed design cropping pattern and a rainfall probability of 75%is concerned. The total irrigation potential has increased from22.6 Mha in 1951 to 93.95 Mha in 2001, out of which 80.06 Mhahas been utilized at the end of the ninth 5 year plan Jeyaseelan2004. The gap between irrigation potential created and utilized isa matter of concern. To overcome this gap, the Government ofIndia constituted the Command Area Development AuthorityCADA in 1974 with an aim to improve water distributionamong users below outlet. However, CADA has produced mixedand rather disappointing results. The failure of CADA has shiftedthe focus of policymakers and researchers to the improvement ofcanal irrigation performance through management of the mainsystem Chambers 1988.The success of irrigation system operation and planning de-pends on the quantiﬁcation of supply and demand, and equitabledistribution of supply to meet the demand if possible, or to mini-mize the gap between the supply and demand. The success of anirrigation water delivery system can be measured by how well itmeets the objectives of delivering an adequate and dependablesupply of water in an equitable, efﬁcient manner to users servedby the system.

On the other hand, a few attempts have beenmade to develop irrigation system management or decision sup-port systems to assist water managers in making appropriate de-cisions, e.g., CADSM Prajamwong 1994, OPDM USU 1996,OMIS Delft Hydraulics and DHV Consultants 1989, INCAMakin 1995, SIMIS Mateos et al. 2002. These models mainlyfocus on the demand and distribution aspects only. Therefore,these may not meet the objectives of the irrigation departmentsdealing with the whole scheme. Irrigation projects, that receivewater from a reservoir can be challenging to manage as annualﬂuctuations in runoff from the reservoir’s catchment can haveconsiderable impact on the irrigation management strategy.Rainfall–runoff relationship is an extremely complex and dif-ﬁcult problem involving many variables, which are intercon-nected in a very complicated way. Most of the models work bestwhen data on the physical characteristics of the watershed areavailable at the model grid scale Miller et al. 2002. These kindsof data are rarely available, even in heavily instrumented researchwatersheds. Now remote sensing and geographic information sys-tem GIS make it easier to extract land surface properties atspatial and temporal scales. One of the most widely used tech-niques for estimating direct runoff depths from storm rainfall isthe USDA Soil Conservation Service’s SCS curve number CNmethod NRCS 2003. Its use, however, requires a detailedknowledge of several important properties of the watershed whichmay not be readily available. Many researchers Tiwari et al.1991,1997 used land use/land cover information derived fromsatellite data of Landsat, SPOT, and Indian Remote Sensing Sat-ellite, and integrated them with GIS to estimate SCS CNs andrunoff. Routing of runoff in river network may be undertakenusing a variety of modeling procedures. The Muskingum methodOverton 1966 continues to be popular for ﬂood routing. Musk-ingum routing parameters related to physical and hydraulic char-acteristics of channel can also be obtained using the GIStechnique. The complexity and nonlinearity involved in therainfall–runoff process and routing of runoff downstream througha channel make it attractive to try the artiﬁcial neural networkANN approach, which is inherently suited to problems that aremathematically difﬁcult to describe. The majority of studies haveproven that ANNs are capable of performing quite satisfactorilyin rainfall–runoff modeling. Due to acceptable performance inrainfall–runoff modeling, ANN remains a topic of continuing in-terestde VosandRientjes2005;Garbrecht2006. TheLevenberg–Marquardt optimization technique Levenberg 1944;Marquardt 1963 can be incorporated into the backpropagationalgorithm to make training faster and efﬁcient to ﬁnd better op-tima for a variety of problems.In real-world situations, the reservoir operating rules guide theoperators in making the actual release decisions. A number ofexcellent texts on reservoir operating rules are available. Yeh1985 and Wurbs 1993 reviewed various models reported in theliterature and provided a state-of-the-art summary of the applica-tions of reservoir operation models. The HEC-3 HEC 1971 andHEC-5 HEC 1979 models are considered to be the best docu-mented among the general reservoir simulation models. However,they do not perform any rainfall–runoff computations and, thus,inﬂow to the reservoir must be input to these models.For ﬁeld crops, CROPWAT Smith 1992, SWSSM Lamacqand Wallender 1994, ISM George et al. 2000, 2004, etc., areexamples of widely used models that are based on semiempiricaland physical approaches. Many scientists have used numericaland analog models, e.g., SAWAH ten Berge et al. 1992,ORYZA2000 Bouman et al. 2001, etc., to study the speciﬁcaspects of water movement through and below the root zone ofpaddy basins.Hydraulic models can simulate the changes in the water sur-face proﬁles in canals with respect to time and space. The con-veyance losses can be assessed for speciﬁed surface andsubsurface conditions using such models if the seepage rate isknown. Many complicated simulation models of the hydraulics ofﬂow in irrigation canals are available. Some, like MIKE-11 DHI1992, CANALMAN Merkely 1995, HEC-RAS USAC 2002,CanalMod Islam 2005, etc., can simulate ﬂow under complexcanal ﬂow conditions operation of gates, presence of control anddrop structures, etc.. These models were developed for steadyand gradually varied ﬂow. They are highly data intensive andcannot adequately account for some actual ﬂow conditions, likefrequent canal ﬁlling and dewatering as required for the rota-tional irrigation practiced under many schemes in India whichinvolve rapid ﬂow changes. Several attempts at using such mod-els in India have not proved successful. Mandavia and Acharya1995, after a review of the applications of such models underIndian conditions, recommended that simple models that useavailable data be used.Though a number of models have been developed by variousresearchers in the past for runoff prediction, reservoir operation,crop water demand calculation, and canal ﬂow simulation, thesemodels work independently and interlinking them is quite a dif-ﬁcult task. It involves setup, calibration, and validation of all themodels separately and extraction of one model’s output to use itas input to other model. The entire process becomes time consum-ing and tedious as one faces many difﬁculties such as repetitivedata entry, different modeling approach, incompatible data for-mat, varied time scale, etc. However, a couple of attempts havebeen made to combine the hydraulic-hydrologic simulations ofcanal command for efﬁcient irrigation water management, one inthe Mahanadi Reservoir irrigation scheme Singh et al. 1997 andthe other in right bank main canal RBMC of the KangsabatiIrrigation Project, West Bengal Mishra et al. 2005. Both of theabove-noted studies, however, did not take into account reservoircomponent. Hajilal et al. 1998a,b, though they incorporated areservoir component in a similar study the in Jayakwadi IrrigationProject, Maharashtra, did not consider reservoir catchment hy-drology. Among the existing models, none is capable of integrat-ing all of the components catchment, reservoir, canal, andcommand responsible for the efﬁcient management of reservoir-based irrigation projects. Recently, Hameed and Podger 2001introduced the integrated quantity-quality model IQQM anddemonstrated its capabilities using the Lachlan River system,Australia, as an example. IQQM can be used for any river valley,and has proven to be a useful tool for the development, evalua-tion, and selection of operational rules for complex river systems.The present study was taken up to develop an integratedreservoir-based canal irrigation model IRCIM. In a companionpaper, results dealing with the calibration, validation, and testingof the developed model with Kangsabati Irrigation Project, WestBengal, India, as a case study is presented.150 / JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING © ASCE / MARCH/APRIL 2009J.

It consistsof three modules, viz., catchment module, reservoir module, andcrop water demand module. The catchment module predicts dailyrunoff from the catchment that inﬂows to the reservoir. Depend-ing on the data availability, this module is provided with the ﬂex-ibility of choosing between the SCS curve number methodcombined with the Muskingum routing technique and an ANN-based model. The reservoir module is based on conservation ofmass approach, and results in daily reservoir storage. The cropwater demand module is comprised of water-balance models forboth paddy and ﬁeld crops. Irrigation management system servesas the program ﬂow controller for the model and runs the requiredmodule when needed. For postseason evaluation of the irrigationsystem, performance indicators—adequacy, efﬁciency, equity, anddependability—have been used. Theoretical considerations of dif-ferent modules are presented in the following.Catchment ModuleThe SCS curve number method combined with the Muskingumrouting technique can be used for predicting runoff from thecatchment if information on land use, soil, and river network isavailable; otherwise, an ANN-based model can be used for relat-ing rainfall with daily runoff. In the ANN-based technique, theLevenberg–Marquardt algorithm is used for training the back-propagation network.SCS CN Method Combined with Muskingum RoutingTechniqueThe CN method SCS 1972, also known as the hydrologic soilcover complex method, is a versatile and widely used procedurefor runoff estimation. The SCS method involves the relationshipof land cover description, hydrologic soil group, and curve num-ber. Hydrologic soil group is obtained from the type of soilMaidment 1992. CN for the antecedent moisture conditionAMC II, CN2, ﬁrst needs to be determined from a standard tableSCS 1986 using land cover type and hydrologic group. CN forAMC I and AMC III CN1 and CN3 then can be estimated usingCN2 value NRCS 2003. For calculating recharge capacity fromrainfall data, AMC for a particular subbasin is estimated using thepast 5 days rainfall data and, accordingly, CN value can be se-lected from CN1, CN2, and CN3 values. Runoff depth Qd, mmcan be obtained with initial abstraction consideration as Follows:Qd =P − Ia2/P − Ia + S if P  Ia0if P  Ia1where Ia=initial abstraction mm; P=precipitation mm; and S=recharge capacity mm.Once surface runoff generated in the subbasin is obtained, theamount of surface runoff reaching the subbasin outlet point iscalculated as Neitsch et al. 2002Qmi = Qsri + Qsti−11 − exp− surlag/Tc2where Qm=surface runoff discharged to the main channel, m3;Qst=surface runoff stored or lagged from the previous day, m3;surlag=surface runoff lag coefﬁcient, required if Tc24 h de-fault value=4 h; and Tc=time of concentration h.From different subbasin outlet points, surface runoff values arerouted up to the outlet point of the reservoir catchment using theMuskingum routing technique Overton 1966.ANN Technique Using the Levenberg–Marquardt AlgorithmIn modeling any process, the neurons in the input layer and outputlayer consist of the input and output values of the process, respec-tively. The total input Hij to jth hidden neuron is a linear functionof ith input neuron values XXi that are connected to jth hiddenneuron by weights Wij asHij =iXXiWij3The jth hidden neuron has a real-value output HOj, which is anonlinear function of its total input. Units can be given biasesbj by introducing an extra input to each neuron which alwayshas a value of 1:Hoj = 1/1 + e−Hij+bj4The use of a linear function for combing the inputs to a unitbefore applying the nonlinearity greatly simpliﬁes the learningprocedure. The aim is to ﬁnd a set of weights that ensure that foreach input vector, the output vector produced by the network isthe same as or sufﬁciently close to the desired output vector. Ifthere is a ﬁxed, ﬁnite set of input–output pattern, the total error inthe performance of the network with a particular set of weightscan be computed by comparing the actual and desired outputvectors for every pattern asE = 12C JOj,c − TPj,c25where c=index over patterns input–output pairs; j=index forneurons in output layer; O=actual value of an output neuron; andTP=predicted value of an output neuron.The Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm Levenberg 1944; Mar-quardt 1963 works by making the assumption that the underlyingfunction being modeled by the neural network is linear. Based onthis assumption, the minimum can be determined exactly in asingle step. The calculated minimum is tested, and if the error islower, the algorithm moves the weights to the new point. Thisprocess is repeated iteratively on each generation. As the linearassumption is ill-founded, it can easily lead the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm to test a point that is inferior perhaps evenwildly inferior to the current one. The clever aspect of theLevenberg–Marquardt algorithm is that the determination of thenew point is actually a compromise between a step in the direc-tion of steepest descent and the above-mentioned leap. Successfulsteps are accepted and lead to strengthening of the linearity as-Fig. 1.

Thus, the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm continuouslyswitches its approach and can make very rapid progress Haganand Menhaj 1994. It uses the approximate Hessian matrix sec-ond derivatives of error matrix, E in the weight update procedureas follows:Wij = − H +  · Im−1 · JT · r6where r=residual error vector; =variable small scalar that con-trols the learning process; Im=identity matrix; J=Jacobian matrix=E; JT=transpose of the J; and H=Hessian matrix =2E=JTJ approximately.Reservoir ModuleTotal storage in the reservoir is the storage corresponding to stageof the reservoir obtained from the stage–storage curve. Storage ofthe reservoir at the end of ith day can be calculated from follow-ing water balance equation:Vstorage,i = Vstorage,i−1 + Vinflow,i + Vprecipitation,i − Vrelease,i − Vevaporation,i− Vseepage,i − Vothers,i7where Vstorage,i=volume of water stored in the reservoir m3;Vinflow,i=volume of water entering the reservoir from catchmentm3; Vprecipitation,i=volume of precipitation directly falling on thereservoir m3; Vrelease,i=volume of water ﬂowing out of the res-ervoir m3; Vevaporation,i=volume of water evaporated from thereservoir m3; Vseepage,i=volume of water percolated from the res-ervoir m3; and Vothers,i=volume of water used from the reservoirfor other purposes m3.Release from the reservoir can be obtained from rule curve ofthat particular reservoir. For each reservoir, rule curve is framedby the experts on the basis of the past data. Operating policies andassociated rule curves are deﬁned for reservoir release for irriga-tion purposes as a function of the existing storage volume of thereservoir, time of year, and expected natural inﬂow to the reser-voir from catchment. From rule curve, minimum allowable stagecorresponding to a particular date of the year can be obtained.Maximum permissible release/outﬂow from the reservoir is takenas the volume of water available above this minimum stage.Evaporation from the reservoir can be estimated either by the panevaporation method or by the Penman method Linsley et al.1988. Volume of water percolated from the reservoir bottom canbe obtained using saturated hydraulic conductivity KS of soil atthe reservoir bottom.Crop Water Demand ModuleFor estimation of reference evapotranspiration the following threemethods are available in the model, i.e., the FAO-24 pan evapo-ration method Doorenbos and Pruitt 1977, Hargreaves methodHargreaves 1994 and FAO-56 modiﬁed Penman Monteithmethod Allen et al. 1998. Further, for calculating crop evapo-transpiration the option of using a single as well as dual cropcoefﬁcient FAO-56 Allen et al. 1998 method is included. Effec-tive rainfall, the part of the precipitation that inﬁltrates into thesoil and is available for crop use, can be calculated either by theﬁxed percentage of rainfall method or USDA SCS method SCS1967.If there is standing water in the ﬁeld, the crop is in pondingphase. If moisture content of soil is in between ﬁeld capacity andsaturation, the crop is in saturation phase and if moisture contentof soil is below ﬁeld capacity it is in depletion phase Fig. 2. Inthe case of the ponding phase, deep percolation can be estimatedeither by one-dimensional Laplace equation Khepar et al. 2000or by an empirical equation developed by Mishra et al. 1998. Ifthe crop is in saturation phase, deep percolation is calculated by aprocess developed by Khepar et al. 2000. However, instead ofBrooks and Corey 1964, as proposed by Khepar et al. 2000,the developed model uses the van Genuchten–Mualem modelvan Genuchten 1980; Mualem 1976 for the estimation of unsat-urated hydraulic conductivity. In case of the depletion phase, deeppercolation loss is assumed as negligible.The soil water balance can be expressed in terms of soil mois-ture depletion Dr for ﬁeld crops other than paddy asDr,i = Dr,i−1 − ERi − IRi + ETc,i + DPi8where IR=applied irrigation mm and DP=deep percolationmm =0, as moisture content of soil is assumed to be less thanequal to ﬁeld capacity moisture content.In the case of paddy, the water balance calculation is per-formed considering three different phases—ponding phase, satu-ration phase, and depletion phase. The Water balance calculationin the depletion phase is completely identical to the depletionDr,i calculation of ﬁeld crops. Water balance equations forpaddy in poding phase and saturation phase, respectively, are asfollows:HPi = HPi−1 + ERi + IRi − ETc,i − DPi9Ds,i = Ds,i−1 + ETc,i + DPi − ERi − IRi10where HPi=height of ponding at the end of ith day mm andDs,i=depth of water required to reach saturation at the end of ithday mm.As long as HPi0, it is in ponding phase, but when HPi0, itenters the saturation phase or depletion phase asDs,i = − HPi11If 0Ds,iSAWi, it is in the saturation phase, but if Ds,iSAWi, it is in the depletion phase and the following equationsare used:Dr,i = Ds,i − SAWi,SAWi = S − FCZr,i12where Dr,i=depth of water required to reach ﬁeld capacity in theroot zone at the end of ith day mm; SAWi=depth of waterrequired to reach saturation from ﬁeld capacity mm; S andFC=saturation and ﬁeld capacity moisture contents on volumetricbasis fraction; and Zr,i=root zone depth at the end of ith daymm.Fig. 2.

It also controls and steersthe data ﬂow among different modules and decides optimum al-location of water at distributary head by a rotational distributionsystem. In rotational irrigation system, the irrigation water is ra-tioned strictly in proportion to the area under distributaries andsupplied on a predetermined rotational schedule. This irrigationsystem is commonly practiced in the Indian subcontinent. Thecardinal principle in this system is that the available water, what-ever be the quantum, is allocated to distributaries in equal propor-tion to their command areas. The principal management objectiveis to achieve high efﬁciency of water use by imposing waterscarcity equally on each and every distributary. The signiﬁcance,however, lies in ensuring adequate, timely, and dependable watersupply to all the distributaries, regardless of their location withrespect to the reservoir, achieving egalitarian distribution of irri-gation beneﬁts. A ﬂowchart of the developed irrigation manage-ment system is shown in Fig. 3. In rotational irrigation system,distributaries are grouped as followsNumber of groups = Distributary capacity/Main canal capacity13Rotation period is the period within which all groups should getone turn of irrigation. Turn can be calculated by dividing rota-tional period among groups in their area proportion. Stage limit isa value in percentage user input. On a particular day, if theactual stage of the reservoir is “stage limit” percent more than thestage corresponding to rule curve, then only rotation can bestarted. Optimal release from the reservoir on a daily basis isconstant throughout the rotation period. This value ranges frommain canal capacity to zero. Daily optimal discharge value atdistributary head is constant throughout the turn period. It rangesfrom zero to design discharge of that particular distributary. Theseoptimal distributary discharges are propagated through the maincanal to determine the total required release from the reservoir. Ifthe total required release at the main canal head comes out to bemore than the simulated optimal reservoir release, the optimaldistributary discharges are scaled down in the same proportion ofoptimal reservoir release to required release. Then again scaleddown discharge values are propagated through the main canal. Byrepeated propagation, the model calculates the actual possible dis-charge at distributaries for the optimal reservoir release.The canal ﬂow model of Vyas and Sarma 1992 was modiﬁedand used in IRCIM to estimate the wetted area in canals as well asseepage losses and the irrigation release requirement at the head-work of the main canal. For each group, the procedure starts atthe downstream end distributary of the group and progresses se-quentially upstream up to the ﬁrst distributary of that particulargroup. Then, total irrigation requirement of that group is trans-lated up to the reservoir through the main canal. Let Q1R1 and Q2R1be the required discharges m3 s−1 in the Reach 1 R1 at thedownstream and upstream ends, respectively Fig. 4.

D1ranging from zero to maximum depth of the canal is estimatedfrom the known value of Q1R1 by solving Manning’s equation:Q1R1 = 1ncbD1 + zcD12bD1 + zcD12/b + 2D11 + zc22/3Sc1/216First estimate of the seepage loss is made usingSLE = SRPcRL17and the corresponding estimate of the required discharge at theupstream end of the reach becomesQE2 = Q1R1 + SLE18where SR=seepage rate seepage volume per unit wetted area perunit time m s−1; Pc=wetted perimeter assuming that the depthof ﬂow in the reach is D1, m; and RL=reach length of canalm.The depth of ﬂow at the upstream end, D2, is obtained bysolvingQE2 = Ac/ncR2/3Sc1/219where Ac=bD2+zcD22; R=Ac/Pc; Pc=b+2D21+zc2 Averagedepth:DA = D1 + D2/220Considering this DA as the new D1 value, the above-presentedsteps are repeated. When the difference of values of two succes-sive DA becomes less than a given error tolerance, that DA valueis accepted as a ﬁnal one.

Water use, crop quality and growth, and grower behavior toward adoption of the new technology were monitored, when all decision making related to system operation was carried out by the grower. Two cultivars of poinsettia (Euphorbia ×pulcherrima) and three cultivars of geranium (Pelargonium ×hortorum) were produced in side-by-side trials over the course of 2 years while comparing grower-controlled, sensor-based automated irrigation with traditional grower-managed (timer-based) irrigation. Plant quality was equivalent between irrigation treatments across all five trials. Differences in plant size were noted in four of the five trials between irrigation treatments, but in all instances these differences were not judged by the commercial grower to impact marketability of the crop. No reductions in irrigation water use were noted with the sensor-based irrigation system, which differed from previous research using this technology in ornamental production. Over the course of 2 years, the number of plants produced using sensor-based irrigation control was scaled up, indicating increasing confidence in, and adoption of, the technology. Managers at the facility found that sensor-based irrigation facilitated reallocation of labor from irrigation management, which was especially valuable during peak production and shipping periods. The payback period calculated from labor savings would be roughly 1.5 years if the sensor-based irrigation system was implemented throughout the facility.Keywords: poinsettia; Euphorbia ×pulcherrima; geranium; Pelargonium ×hortorum; extension; outreach; wireless networksAgricultural water scarcity resulting from climate change, a growing population, and increased environmental regulation is expected to become more pervasive in the future (Strzepek and Boehlert, 2010). Water scarcity has the potential to significantly impact floriculture production in some, if not all, regions of the United States, which is valued at ≈$4 billion annually [U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), 2015a]. State and federal regulations that limit water consumption and runoff for floricultural and specialty crop production are already in place in some areas of the United States (Fulcher et al., 2016). These regulations are expected to increase in stringency and prevalence as the population increases, urban and suburban centers continue to expand, and the public’s understanding of the functional value of ecosystems grows (Costanza et al., 2014). Resulting regulatory and environmental pressures will create greater incentives for floriculture producers to effectively manage limited water resources moving forward (Fereres et al., 2003), even in areas where water costs are currently low and water availability high. In addition to future water availability concerns, labor costs and employee management, retention, and training are persistent challenges for commercial horticulture producers. Mathers et al. (2010) noted that labor accounts for 40% of nursery production costs, whereas labor retention rates were 51% after 5 years. The horticulture industry is facing critical shortfalls in labor pools with tightening regulations regarding migrant workers and an increasingly competitive domestic labor market (Bellenger et al., 2008). Greenhouse and nursery positions are typically lower paying, averaging $19,330 annually, making worker acquisition and retention difficult (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2015; U.S. Census Bureau, 2015).Automation and mechanization are means by which horticultural producers are overcoming labor challenges (Posadas et al., 2008). Automation has been found to have a number of benefits for specialty crop producers, including improving production quality, reducing production costs, increasing market value, reducing hazardous working conditions, and improving professional esteem (Ling, 1994). Automated irrigation through precision soil moisture sensing has been shown to be an efficient means of regulating irrigation application (Lea-Cox et al., 2013; Majsztrik et al., 2013). Although a number of different soil moisture sensors exist, capacitance sensors have been used to calculate volumetric water content (θ). These sensors have been used in commercial nursery trials in conjunction with wireless networks to produce a number of observed benefits (Belayneh et al., 2013; Chappell et al., 2013a; van Iersel et al., 2009). Significant reductions in irrigation water usage, as well as reductions in crop production times and crop shrinkage due to disease have been noted (Chappell et al., 2012). Economic analysis by Lichtenberg et al. (2013) reported that sensor-based automated irrigation systems increased annualized nursery profits by 50% over standard irrigation practices. Savings in labor, irrigation volume, fungicides, fertilizers, energy costs for pumping, and accelerated crop production times all contributed to making soil moisture sensor-based automated irrigation more profitable than conventional (often timer-based) methods of irrigation. Saavoss et al. (2016) had similar findings when comparing implementation of sensor-based automated irrigation in cut snapdragon (Antirrhinum majus) production. Sensor-based irrigation increased profits by 65% per year by improving quality and number of stems produced per crop, as well as reducing production time per crop, allowing an additional 2.5 crops per year to be produced. In addition, sensor-based automated irrigation systems have been used in a number of controlled studies in university greenhouses. Floriculture species trialed in these studies have included petunia [Petunia ×hybrida (van Iersel et al., 2010)], poinsettia (Alem et al., 2015a), and periwinkle [Catharanthus roseus (Kim and van Iersel, 2011)]. To our knowledge there have been only three studies (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018) looking at implementation of sensor-based irrigation in commercial production of floriculture crops. These studies have all shown extensive benefits from implementing sensor-based automated irrigation, but have had extensive input from researchers in controlling these types of systems in a commercial setting. The current study postulated that many of the benefits of soil moisture–based automated irrigation observed in nursery crop production and in university-based floriculture trials also would be observed when the system was installed and operated by a commercial floriculture producer. This study sought to determine what advantages these types of systems could offer commercial floriculture producers and observe grower behavior in relation to adoption of the new technology when the producer was allowed full system control, with no researcher input, after an initial training consultation. We hypothesized that soil moisture sensor-based automated irrigation would be readily adopted by the participating grower. In addition, we hypothesized that soil moisture sensor-based automated irrigation would reduce the volume of applied irrigation water while producing equal size and quality plants when compared with traditional timer-based irrigation management.Materials and methodsCommercial partner and plant material.Davis Floral Company (DFC; Dewy Rose, GA) was selected to participate in the study based on willingness to adopt new technology, education level of owners (B.S. Horticulture and M.S. Business Administration), openness to allowing research to be conducted on-site, and expressed interest in automated irrigation technology. DFC is a commercial floriculture producer that uses gutter-connected, polyethylene-covered houses and produces primarily finished annuals and cuttings for the wholesale market. Dewy Rose, GA (lat. 34°09′16.4′′N, long. 82°56′01.0′′W), is in USDA hardiness zone 8A. Five separate trials (e.g., production cycles) were carried out in 2014 and 2015 to compare sensor-based automated irrigation to traditional timer-based grower-controlled irrigation management. All trials took place in two bays of a greenhouse with each bay measuring 145 ft long × 70 ft wide × 15 ft (maximum) height. Plants were produced within the greenhouse either on a fabric-covered gravel pad or on elevated wooden benches (5 ft wide × 65 ft long). Species trialed included three cultivars of geranium (Fantasia Cardinal Red, Fantasia Shocking Pink, and Fantasia Salmon), and two cultivars of poinsettia (Prestige Red and Christmas Day Red). Geranium and poinsettia cultivars were grown in 8-inch-diameter and 6.5-inch-diameter containers (The HC Companies, Middlefield, OH), respectively. All containers were consumer-grade opaque plastic that were loosely filled with commercially available peat-perlite–based growing media (Metro-Mix 360; Sun Gro Horticulture, Agawam, MA).Irrigation control and environmental data.Control treatments for all trials were based on historic irrigation practices used by DFC, which included twice-daily visual inspection of the crop followed by manual irrigation initiation with a timer-based shutoff if irrigation was deemed necessary by the grower. Irrigation was applied to the control treatment via drip tape with emitters rated at 0.4 gal/h at 16-inch spacing (Space-It; Netafim, Fresno, CA). In some cases, when the entire crop did not need to be irrigated, primarily edge plants were hand-watered using a handheld wand. For simplicity of terminology, we refer to all grower-based irrigation as timer-based irrigation, as this is the primary historic method that DFC used to irrigate crops and hand watering was infrequently practiced.A soil moisture sensor-based automated irrigation system, similar to systems used to control irrigation in commercial nursery settings described by Chappell et al. (2013a), was used to provide irrigation to experimental treatments. Five soil moisture sensors (GS3; Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA) were distributed randomly throughout each crop and inserted with the metal prongs aligned vertically downward through the surface of the media. The sensor prongs were entirely inserted into the substrate, with the sensor head at the substrate surface. Sensors were calibrated before the start of the trial at the University of Georgia Horticulture Physiology Laboratory for a peat:perlite [80:20 by volume (Fafard 1p; Fafard, Agawam, MA)] substrate (). Sensors were connected to wireless nodes (nR5-DC; Decagon Devices) and provided readings of θ, bulk electrical conductivity, and soil temperature. Each wireless node was also capable of controlling a 12-V DC latching solenoid valve (075-DV three-fourths inch; Rain Bird, Azusa, CA) that regulated the flow of irrigation water. Over the course of 2 years, a total of four nodes were used to monitor and control θ for 300 to 450 plants per node. One additional node was deployed as a dedicated weather station, monitoring environmental conditions within the greenhouse. Light levels were monitored using a pyranometer (PYR; Decagon Devices) and air movement through the house was measured using a cup anemometer (Davis; Decagon Devices). Temperature and relative humidity were monitored using a temperature and humidity sensor (EHT; Decagon Devices) and cumulative irrigation volume was monitored using eight flow meters (DLJ SJ50; Daniel L. Jerman Co., Hackensack, NJ). Nodes collected readings at 60-s intervals and transmitted the averages every 20 min back to a centrally located base station connected to a computer using a 900-MHz radio (XSC; Digi, Minnetonka, MN). Software to provide a graphical user interface (GUI) and control the sensor-based irrigation system, developed by Carnegie Mellon University (Kohanbash et al., 2013), was installed on the computer and provided monitoring and control capabilities. The software used a web-based GUI that provided access directly at the computer station and remotely over the Internet. The GUI allowed growers to toggle computer-controlled irrigation on and off, establish irrigation set points, and view data collected by the sensor network. Growers established irrigation set points at DFC after 7 d of monitoring θ values. These set points were determined based on θ readings from the monitoring period, as well as visual inspection of the crop(s) at daily intervals. When visual observations indicated the crop had dried to a point at which the grower would typically initiate a manual (timer-based) irrigation cycle, the GUI was consulted to determine the corresponding average θ, which would become the irrigation set point. When average θ readings of four sensors connected to a single node fell below the programmed set point, an irrigation event lasting 300 s was triggered. Because this was a protype system, the programmed irrigation interval coded into the software could not be altered. The system software was programmed to check average θ after each irrigation event and if average θ was still below the programmed set point, an additional irrigation event was triggered. There was no limit to the number of irrigation events that could occur daily. All plants were placed under drip tape with emitters rated at 0.4 gal/h at 16-inch spacing (Space-It; Netafim Inc., Fresno, CA). Fertilization for sensor-based irrigation was specific to each crop and was managed by the section grower to reflect fertilization rates of the grower-irrigated (timer-control) treatment(s). Fertilization for geranium used 12N–0.9P–11.6K (Plantex Cal Mag + P; Master Plant-Prod Inc., Brampton, ON, Canada) at 200 ppm nitrogen (N). Poinsettia production used 300 ppm N of 20N–8.7P–16.6K (J.R. Peters, Allentown, PA) from transplant until first bract color. Once bracts had colored, fertigation was lowered to 200 ppm N of 17N–2.2P–14.1K (Plantex; Master Plant-Prod Inc.). Plants were fertilized at every irrigation event triggered by the sensor-based irrigation system using dedicated injectors (DM14Z2; Dosatron, Clearwater, FL) set to a 1:128 injection ratio.Initial setup of the sensor-based irrigation system occurred on week 14 of 2014 and was used to monitor but not control irrigation in a ‘Fantasia Scarlet Improved’ geranium crop. This initial monitoring period allowed researchers to consult with growers on operation of the system and software, and note soil moisture profiles generated by their irrigation management practices. Irrigation was first controlled by the DFC staff starting at week 35 of 2014 in ‘Prestige Red’ poinsettia. Following the initial trial with poinsettia in the fall, ‘Fantasia Cardinal Red’, ‘Fantasia Shocking Pink’, and ‘Fantasia Salmon’ geranium were trialed in Spring 2015 staring on week 6. ‘Prestige Red’ poinsettia trials were scaled up and repeated in Fall 2015 starting on week 35 and ‘Christmas Day Red’ was added to the trial.Data collection.Growth indexes were calculated as the product of canopy height from the soil line, width of the plant at its widest point, and width perpendicular to that point (). Plant quality was assessed on a standardized 1 to 10 scale developed in coordination with DFC staff, with 1 being a completely dead plant and 10 being a plant with vigorous growth, attractive symmetrical habit, and good foliar tone. Flow meter readings were taken at each sampling period and back-calculated to determine total water use over time. Dry weight measurements were collected from 20 randomly selected plants from each treatment by cutting shoots at the soil line at the end of each trial followed by drying at 85 °C for 72 h. In geranium trials, when plants were determined to be market ready by the grower, the number of inflorescences per plant (for all plants in a treatment) was counted and used to determine the average number of inflorescences per plant. When poinsettias were deemed market ready, anthocyanin content index was sampled on the bracts of 20 plants per treatment using an anthocyanin meter (ACM-200 plus; Opti-Sciences, Hudson, NH). Bract area was determined when plants were considered marketable by selecting three of the largest colored bracts per plant from 20 plants per treatment and measuring leaf area using a leaf area index meter (LI-3000C; LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). Labor time measurements related to irrigation activities were measured over three, 14-d periods in 2015 during the poinsettia crop cycle using push-button timers (MeasuPro Fifure 8; Better Basics, Chestnut Ridge, NY) located at the irrigation controllers for both irrigation treatments as well as the base station computer used to access the GUI.Grower interviews.At the onset of this study, DFC staff were trained on proper use of the sensor-based irrigation system while growing a ‘Fantasia Scarlet Improved’ geranium crop between weeks 14 and 20. Thereafter, researchers served only in a consulting role, with DFC staff controlling all system operation, and initiating all communications with researchers regarding system use and troubleshooting. Researchers intervened only once, because of system malfunction, as a node failed in Summer 2015 due to a suspected lightning strike. DFC staff were able to alter irrigation set points as they saw fit throughout a crop cycle (Fig. 1A–C). Consultation with researchers also consisted of follow-up training of two newly hired staff on how to use the system and how to troubleshoot system errors, similar to the training provided to DFC owners and staff at the onset of this study. Throughout the course of the 2-year study, DFC staff behavior and opinions of the sensor-based irrigation system were documented quarterly. Semistructured interviews were conducted with the owners, head grower, and section grower to determine their impressions and document comments about the system. During these interviews, researchers did not offer suggestions or training on system use (even when the system was being used improperly), as not to influence DFC staff use of the system. Two annual presentations were given in which results from the studies conducted the previous 12 months were discussed and growers were formally asked for their input on the performance of the system.View Full SizeFig. 1.Comparative total irrigation water use (A–C) and growth indexes (D–F) for three cultivars of geranium using a soil moisture sensor-based automated irrigation system (sensor-based) or traditional timer-based irrigation (grower). Cultivars Fantasia Cardinal Red and Fantasia Shocking Pink were grown over 42-d periods, whereas Fantasia Salmon was produced over a 34-d period. Dotted vertical lines represent irrigation set points established by the grower, which correspond to soil moisture readings (set points only increased during the study). When readings fell below the established set point, an irrigation event lasting 300 s was triggered by the controlling computer system for the sensor-based irrigation system. Water usage (A–C) was assessed by direct comparison only, as a single flow meter was used for each treatment. Growth indexes () were calculated finding the product of the height of the canopy from the soil line, width of the canopy at its widest point, and the width 90° from that point; ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01; 1 L = 0.2642 gal, 1 cm3 = 0.0610 inch3.Citation: HortTechnology hortte 28, 6; 10.21273/HORTTECH04114-18Download FigureExperimental design and statistics.All trials used side-by-side comparisons of sensor-based automated irrigation (with grower-defined irrigation set points) to that of traditional grower-managed (timer-based) irrigation. Irrigation treatments were treated as fixed effects when analyzing for treatment differences. For all trials, sample plots consisting of 125 plants were established in each irrigation treatment, from which 20 were randomly selected for evaluation of plant quality and growth indexes over the course of a crop cycle. Evaluations were performed every 14 d after the start of each trial, which initiated 7 d after planting. When deemed market ready by DFC staff, 20 plants were randomly selected for additional quality and dry weight measurements. R statistical software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used to analyze all data collected. Geranium inflorescence counts, poinsettia bract size and anthocyanin content index readings, as well as dry canopy weights in all trials were examined using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) comparing irrigation methods. Plant quality ratings and growth indexes were analyzed using two-way repeated measures multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA) over the course of the trials. Experimental setup for irrigation of the 2014 poinsettia trial and 2015 geranium trials as well as labor calculations for the 2015 poinsettia trial were such that single flow meters and timers were used to track water use and labor allocation in each treatment. Because of this limitation, analysis was limited to direct comparisons. In 2015, expansion of poinsettia trials allowed installation of additional flow meters and replication of water use data that were examined using MANOVA analysis.ResultsGeranium.In three trials conducted with geraniums in Spring 2015, direct comparisons of irrigation volume (liters of water applied to a crop), as well as statistical differences in growth indexes, were greater in sensor-based automated irrigation compared with timer-controlled irrigation (Fig. 1). In the first trial of 2015, a ‘Fantasia Cardinal Red’ crop was produced from week 6 to week 12 of the calendar year. In this trial, the greatest differences in irrigation volume applied and growth index were observed (P < 0.01). By the end of the first trial, the sensor-based automated irrigation treatment had used an additional 1010 L of irrigation water, or 12.74 L per plant (Fig. 1A). Growth indexes at the market-ready stage averaged 51% larger or 35,134 ± 1701 cm3 in the sensor-based automated irrigation treatment, compared with 23,253 ± 1281 cm3 in timer-controlled treatment (Fig. 1D–F). Flowering was also reduced as a result of irrigating with sensor-based automated irrigation (P = 0.02), with 0.9 ± 0.2 inflorescences per pot produced with the sensor-based automated irrigation system and 1.7 ± 0.3 inflorescences per pot in timer-controlled treatment (Fig. 2).View Full SizeFig. 2.Average number of inflorescences per pot for three geranium cultivars grown with a soil moisture sensor-based automated irrigation system (sensor-based), as compared with timer-based irrigation (grower). Cultivars Fantasia Cardinal Red and Fantasia Shocking Pink were grown over 42-d periods, whereas ‘Fantasia Salmon’ was produced over a 34-d period; *P < 0.05.Citation: HortTechnology hortte 28, 6; 10.21273/HORTTECH04114-18Download FigureBased on results from the first geranium crop (‘Fantasia Cardinal Red’), the grower reduced the initial θ set point for the sensor-based automated irrigation system in subsequent crops (Fig. 1B and C) to 10% θ (‘Fantasia Shocking Pink’) and 12% θ (‘Fantasia Salmon’). Despite the lowered initial θ set point, the grower continued to increase θ set points over the course of production. In direct comparison with timer-controlled irrigation, an additional 325 L of total irrigation water, or 4.10 L per plant, was used by the sensor-based automated irrigation system to produce the cultivar Fantasia Salmon, whereas an additional 327 L, or 4.12 L per plant, was used to produce the cultivar Fantasia Shocking Pink. In cultivar Fantasia Salmon (week 15 to week 20), the sensor-based irrigation system produced plants with a 14% larger (P < 0.01) growth index, averaging 11,687 ± 404 cm3 at market ready compared with timer-controlled plants that averaged 10,245 ± 313 cm3. Growth indexes from plants grown with sensor-based automated irrigation were 28% larger (P < 0.01) when market ready in ‘Fantasia Shocking Pink’ (week 15 to week 21), averaging 16,747 ± 745 cm3, whereas timer-controlled plants averaged 13,048 ± 634 cm3. Flower counts were equivalent between the two irrigation treatments in both ‘Fantasia Salmon’ (P = 0.49) and ‘Fantasia Shocking Pink’ (P = 0.72) (Fig. 2).Poinsettia.Poinsettia production was trialed in both 2014 and 2015, with ‘Prestige Red’ used in both years and ‘Christmas Day Red’ only in 2015. In 2014, the sensor-based automated irrigation system used 0.54 L per plant of additional irrigation water per plant, or 163 L total for the block of 300 plants, when compared directly with timer-controlled irrigation. In 2015, the trial size and number of flow meters was expanded to allow for statistical analysis of water usage between the two irrigation treatments. The sensor-based automated irrigation system did not differ in its water use on a per-plant basis (11.75 ± 1.30 L) when compared with timer-controlled treatments (13.52 ± 1.02 L) (Fig. 3). Per-plant water use was ≈12 L per plant under drip-line irrigation, which is similar to numbers reported by Morvant et al. (1998) and estimates derived from data published by Schuch et al. (1996). In both 2014 (P = 0.74) and 2015 (P = 0.79), ‘Prestige Red’ poinsettia received equivalent plant-quality ratings when comparing irrigation control by the sensor-based system and via timers. Plant-quality ratings also were equivalent in ‘Christmas Day Red’ poinsettia produced in 2015 (P = 0.34). Similarity of plant-quality ratings was confirmed by bract anthocyanin content measurements that were also similar across all three cultivar and year combinations (data not shown). Growth indexes were similar for ‘Prestige Red’ in 2014 (P = 0.16) and ‘Christmas Day Red’ in 2015 (P = 0.53) (Fig. 4); however, in 2015, ‘Prestige Red’ plants grown with the sensor-based automated irrigation system had a lower growth index (P > 0.01) than timer-irrigated plants.

Between 8 and 24 Sept. 2015, ≈100 min of labor were devoted to timer-based irrigation treatments, whereas none was needed to manage the sensor-based automated irrigation treatments. Between 20 Oct. and 8 Nov. 2015, ≈22 min of labor was devoted to timer-based irrigation treatments and 1 min was needed to manage sensor-based automated irrigation treatments. Between 3 and 8 Nov. 2015, ≈45 min of labor was devoted to timer-based irrigation treatments, and no time was needed to manage the sensor-based automated irrigation treatments. Over the combined 6-week period, growers documented ≈166 min of labor managing grower-controlled irrigation, compared with ≈1 min to monitor the sensor-based automated irrigation system. This equates to a roughly 99.5% reduction in labor requirements when using sensor-based automated irrigation.DiscussionWater use and plant growth.Increased water use by the sensor-based automated irrigation system was observed in trials conducted with geraniums and the 2014 poinsettia trial. Equivalent water use was observed in the 2015 poinsettia trial. We hypothesize these results stem from the approach that DFC staff took to manage irrigation. Initial selection of irrigation set points and subsequent adjustment throughout crop development maintained high substrate moisture levels, in some cases close to saturation. For example, in the ‘Fantasia Salmon’ and ‘Fantasia Shocking Pink’ geranium crops, irrigation set points were increased four times over the course of the growth cycle, representing an 8% and 5% increase in θ, respectively (Fig. 1A–C). Interviews with DFC personnel suggest that threshold management practices were the consequence of a combination of historical grower production preferences and a lack of awareness of how the sensor-based automated irrigation system operated, despite a 6-week initial training of DFC staff on system operation. Historical preferences for production were to maintain high levels of substrate moisture to act as a buffer against drought stress and to push crop growth. Grower perceptions of the sensor-based automated irrigation system were such that they believed irrigation set points needed to be gradually increased to match plant growth, as is recommended when using timer-based irrigation methods (Chappell et al., 2013b). In timer-based systems, the only method of applying more irrigation is to increase the run-time. The same behavior is not necessary when setting soil moisture sensor-based automated irrigation, because increased crop water use will automatically increase irrigation frequency. This perception resulted in the continual upward adjustment of irrigation set points by the section grower throughout crop production in all trials (Fig. 1A–C). Nemali and van Iersel (2006) demonstrated that a similar soil moisture–based irrigation system was able to maintain irrigation control as plants developed and their water usage changed, without modification of irrigation set points. In previous studies using sensor-based automated irrigation systems, researchers controlled irrigation set points that were established based on best management practices (Chappell et al., 2013b), substrate physical properties, and grower input. Once irrigation set points were established, they would remain in place by researchers for the duration of the production cycle (Alem et al., 2015b; Kim et al., 2011; van Iersel et al., 2010). High irrigation set points observed in this study may have contributed to results observed in the first geranium trial that exhibited increased growth indexes and reduced flowering, indicative of increased vegetative growth, which were observed in the crop irrigated with the sensor-based automated system. Increasing θ has been correlated with increased dry shoot weight and a reduction in flowers when combined with high fertility in petunias (Alem et al., 2015b; Kim et al., 2011; van Iersel et al., 2010). Despite reductions in flowering in ‘Fantasia Cardinal Red’ and increased water use and growth indexes in all geranium cultivars, marketability of crops grown with sensor-based automated irrigation system were not affected and plants were sold alongside those produced with grower-managed irrigation. Similarly, poinsettias produced in 2014 and 2015 by the sensor-based automated system had similar water usage as timer-irrigated plants, and were pulled for sale at the same time as timer-irrigated plants. Differences in the growth index between sensor-based and timer-based irrigation in the 2015 ‘Prestige Red’ crop were not judged to', 'unique_identifier': 181}\n",

Several experiments have been conducted internationally to measure soil water status of small-volume containers \\nin soilless substrates, and a large body of knowledge is now available. In this review, we describe the principles of several \\ncurrently commercially available sensors that can be adapted to this purpose, giving advantages and disadvantages of each \\ntype. We conclude that a sensor-based irrigation system has great potential to address the challenges associated with irrigation \\nscheduling, while improving water usage in most nurseries.\\nKeywords: automation, porous substrates, seedlings, small-volume container, timer system\\nINTRODUCTION\\nIrrigation water is becoming increasingly scarce in South \\nAfrica, with the agricultural industry using approximately \\n62% of available fresh water (Pimentel et al., 2004; Fanadzo \\nand Ncube, 2017). Ever-increasing demand for this limited \\nresource for household and industrial use, as well as \\nrecent droughts, has resulted in an urgent need for water \\nconservation (Gleeson et al., 2012). Thus, in commercial \\nnurseries which support the agricultural and forestry sectors, \\nit is becoming increasingly important to develop efficient \\nirrigation systems. Improved irrigation practices by nurseries \\ncan save water and reduce the costs of irrigation, and have \\nthe potential to improve seedling quality, reduce leaching of \\nnutrients, and lower the incidence of pathogen infestation \\n(Belayneh et al., 2013; Lichtenberg et al., 2013; Bayer et al., \\n2015; Saavoss et al., 2016; Lea-Cox et al., 2017; Wheeler et \\nal., 2017). Many biological and biophysical processes, such \\nas seed germination, seedling nutrition and growth, as well \\nas transpiration and evaporative cooling, are dependent \\non sufficient moisture via efficient irrigation (Bittelli, 2010; \\n2011). In most commercial nurseries, seedlings are grown \\nin containers with small-volume cavities ranging from 25 to \\n100 mL (examples of some forestry seedling containers are \\nshown in Fig. 1; Durner, 2013). This optimises the utilisation \\nof nursery and transportation space while ensuring the best \\nperformance when planted in the field. In such containers, \\nplant roots have a limited substrate volume to explore for \\nwater. Although space saving, one of the difficulties with \\nthese containers is that the substrate water status can range \\nfrom near-saturation immediately after irrigation, to near-\\ndryness after several hours without irrigation (Van Iersel \\net al., 2011; Montesano et al., 2016; Lea-Cox et al., 2017). \\nIrrigation scheduling for these containers should, therefore, \\naim at maintaining the media water content at levels that \\nminimise seedling water stress and maximise irrigation \\nefficiency during periods that require stress-free growth (Van \\nIersel et al., 2011).\\nCommercial nurseries generally irrigate their seedlings \\nbased on the visual appearance of the substrate (wet or \\ndry), their intuition and experience (growers may pick up \\nthe container to feel its relative ‘weight’), and often rely on \\na fixed timer-based system (Jones, 2004; 2008; Lea-Cox \\net al., 2011; 2017). Although the settings of a timer-based \\nsystem can be adjusted, it is set to irrigate according to a \\npredetermined schedule to apply water at a particular time \\nof day and for a particular duration (Nemali and Van Iersel, \\n2006; Montesano et al., 2016). Such timer-based systems have \\nbeen widely adopted due to their ease of use, relatively low \\ncost, ease of programming and success in irrigating correctly \\nwhen managed closely during periods of peak water demand \\n(Nemali et al., 2007; Lea-Cox, 2012). However, they can be \\nineffective and inefficient since water requirements may vary \\nby species, season, microclimate and changes in root density \\nor leaf area as the plant grows (Lea-Cox, 2012). For example, \\nsuch systems can waste water on cooler and cloudy days due \\nto fixed irrigation schedules which operate irrespective of \\nweather changes (Van Iersel et al., 2011). In addition, most \\nnursery managers are risk averse, preferring to apply excess \\nwater to ensure against system failure or heterogeneity of \\napplication (Jones, 2004; 2008). However, with increasing \\nwater costs and restrictions, it is becoming more necessary \\nto limit excessive water application. Therefore, scheduling \\nirrigation under fixed timer-based systems may be inaccurate \\nand costly and, considering these issues, there is a need for a \\nmore efficient method. \\nThe use of soil water sensors to control automated \\nirrigation systems is proposed as a useful alternative. \\nHowever, sensor-based irrigation systems are not widely used \\nin South African nurseries. This may be due to perceived \\n(i) high start-up costs, too expensive to adopt on a large \\n*Corresponding author, email: nkosinathi.kaptein@icfr.ukzn.ac.za\\nReceived 20 November 2017; accepted in revised form 26 June 2019\\nhttps://doi.org/10.17159/wsa/2019.v45.i3.6750\\nAvailable at https://www.watersa.net\\nISSN 1816-7950 (Online) = Water SA Vol. 45 No. 3 July 2019\\nPublished under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence (CC BY 4.0)\\n528\\nscale; (ii) difficulty in automation; and (iii) low reliability \\nand maintenance issues (Annandale et al., 2011; Lea-Cox, \\n2012; Belayneh et al., 2013). For most commercial nurseries, \\nthe initial cost and the ease of use are the most crucial \\nconsiderations for adopting a sensor-based irrigation system. \\nRegardless of these challenges, numerous sensors with the \\npotential to be adapted for use in nursery substrates are well \\ndocumented in the literature (Burnett and Van Iersel, 2008; \\nChappell et al., 2013; Bayer et al., 2015; Montesano et al., \\n2016; Saasvoss et al., 2016; Wheeler et al., 2017). Increasing \\nfreshwater scarcity, and pressure from governments, society, \\nand concerned bodies to conserve water, gives motive to \\ninvestigate sensor-based irrigation systems. Thus, the aim of \\nthis review was to evaluate commercially available soil water \\nsensors that can be connected to an automated irrigation \\nsystem to measure and control water status in small-volume \\nnursery containers to improve nursery water management.\\nSCheDUlINg IRRIgaTION IN Small-vOlUme \\nCONTaINeRS\\nSoilless substrates, as used in many commercial nurseries, \\nare generally porous and have relatively large particle sizes \\ncompared to mineral soils. They tend to release more water at \\nvery low matric potential (−1 to −40 kPa), which is 10 to 100 \\ntimes lower than the matric potential in mineral soils (Lea-\\nCox et al., 2011). Also, the rooting system of a nursery plant \\nis confined to the volume of the container. For these reasons, \\nmaintaining optimal water status for soilless substrates is \\ncritical for continued plant growth. A sensor-based system for \\nscheduling irrigation is a logical choice, and consists of sensors \\nlinked to an automated irrigation system that periodically \\nmeasure the substrate water status at a specified interval \\n(Nemali and Van Iersel, 2006; Van Iersel et al., 2013; Lea-Cox et \\nal., 2017; Kaptein et al., 2019). Since water use by the seedling, \\nalong with drainage and evaporation, causes a decrease in \\nsubstrate water level over time, the sensors detect these changes \\nin the substrate volumetric water content (VWC, m3∙m-3) or \\nsoil water potential (Ψ, kPa), and relay that information to \\nan irrigation controller (Fig. 2). The irrigation controller is \\nprogrammed to control (open) selected irrigation valves for \\nirrigation when the water level decreases below a set point \\n(Belayneh et al., 2013; Van Iersel et al., 2013; Bayer et al., 2015; \\nWheeler et al., 2017). The irrigation is then allowed to continue \\nuntil the upper set point of the programme is reached, at which \\ntime the irrigation valves are closed (Fig. 2).\\nIrrigation in small containers may be scheduled using \\ntwo properties, VWC or soil water potential, as described in \\ndetail by Jones (2004; 2008). The VWC indicates the quantity \\nof water available per unit volume of medium, which is easy \\nto measure and control as long as the lower limit (LL) and \\ndrained upper limit (DUL) thresholds are defined (Smith \\nFigure 1. Examples of different sizes of small containers used in many \\ncommercial forestry nurseries showing their associated volumes\\nFigure 2.

In contrast, the soil water \\npotential is the energy status of water per unit volume of \\nmedium, which directly determines whether the substrate \\nwater is available to plants (Scanlon et al., 2002; Jones, 2004; \\nBittelli, 2010; Lea-Cox et al., 2011). Both are related to each \\nother, but this relationship is different for different substrates \\nand depends on pore size distribution (Gebregiorgis and \\nSavage, 2006; Van Iersel et al., 2013). For example, substrates \\nwith larger pores hold less water compared to substrates with \\nsmall pores. This relationship can be determined using a \\nhydraulic conductivity relationship (Van Iersel et al., 2013; \\nSchindler et al., 2016). There is no consensus as to which \\nproperty is better suited for scheduling irrigation between the \\ntwo (Van Iersel et al., 2013), although VWC is relatively easy \\nto measure (Jones, 2004). If VWC is used, matric potential \\nshould also be estimated using hydraulic conductivity to \\ndetermine the plant available water. This is critical in highly \\nporous substrates such as pine bark due to its lower buffering \\ncapacity. Various VWC and soil water potential sensors that \\nmay be used in small-volume containers, and easily connected \\nto a programmable control unit, will be discussed.\\nvOlUmeTRIC waTeR CONTeNT meaSURemeNT \\nSeNSORS\\nThe main aim of measuring VWC is to monitor water status \\nas it diminishes and recharges within the root zone after each \\nirrigation event (Charlesworth, 2005). The commercially \\navailable soil water content sensors do not measure soil \\nwater content directly; instead they detect changes in other \\nsoil properties that can be related to the soil water content \\n(Charlesworth, 2005; Bittelli, 2010; 2011). The most common \\nsoil properties that change with soil water content and are \\neasy to measure include (i) dielectric permittivity (Van Iersel \\net al., 2013); and (ii) thermal conductivity (Song et al., 1998). \\nHowever, for accurate measurement, sensors need to be \\ncalibrated against the gravimetric method, which is the only \\ndirect soil water content measure (Smith and Mullins, 2000; \\nCharlesworth, 2005).\\nDielectric sensors\\nThe term ‘dielectric’ refers to the ability of a substance \\nto store charge from an electromagnetic field (Evett and \\nParkin, 2005; Van Iersel et al., 2013). These sensors use an \\nelectromagnetic technique to determine the VWC, since \\nwater has a much higher dielectric permittivity relative to \\nother constituents of the substrate (Smith and Mullins, 2000; \\nBogena et al., 2007; Bittelli, 2010). The main components \\nof a substrate that affect the dielectric permittivity are air, \\nsolid matrix and water content. The dielectric permittivity \\nof air and a solid matrix is 1 and 5, respectively, compared \\nto that of water which is 80 at 20°C (Czarnomski et al., \\n2005; Bogena et al., 2007; Nemali et al., 2007). Hence, a \\nsmall change in VWC can result in a significant change in \\nthe dielectric permittivity (Nemali et al., 2007; Van Iersel et \\nal., 2013). Thus, the measurement of dielectric permittivity \\ncan be used to indirectly estimate the media VWC through \\npredetermined calibration relationships using the equation \\nof Topp et al. (1980). For this review, frequency domain \\nreflectometry (FDR) and time domain reflectometry (TDR) \\nsensors will be further discussed due to their suitability for \\nuse in small-volume nursery containers.\\nFrequency domain reflectometry\\nMost FDR sensors (also referred to as capacitance sensors) \\nconsist of two prongs (positive and negative electrodes) that \\nproduce an electromagnetic field (Bittelli, 2010) when placed \\nparallel to each other (as shown in Fig. 3). The electromagnetic \\nfield is passed through dielectric material and then its ability \\nto store charge is measured. The charge stored by the substrate \\nand measured by a capacitor is directly related to the dielectric \\npermittivity of a substrate (Bogena et al., 2007). The sensor \\ncircuitry then converts the capacitor charge to a voltage, so it \\ncan be measured using a control unit. Since water molecules \\nstore charge more than other particles in the substrate, \\nthis charge storing ability can be related to VWC through \\nmeasurement of charge time t (s) using:\\n \\n \\n \\n(1)\\nwhere R (Ω) is the series resistance, C (μF) the capacitance, V \\n(V) the supply voltage, Vi the initial voltage and Vf the final \\nvoltage (Charlesworth, 2005). \\nWhen the VWC is high, the capacitor will charge slowly. \\nThis means that the capacitor of a sensor embedded in a wet \\nsubstrate will reach a given voltage threshold later compared to \\na capacitor in a dry substrate. More specifications, advantages \\nand disadvantages of FDR sensors are provided in Table 1.\\nThe FDR sensors are laboratory-calibrated by the \\nmanufacturer in different soilless substrates to produce a generic \\nequation. The factory generic calibration equation has an accuracy \\nrange of 0.03–0.05 m3∙m-3 (Meter Group, 2018a, 2018b). Although \\na generic equation may be used with reasonable accuracy, a \\nsubstrate-specific calibration may be conducted to estimate VWC \\nto within 0.01 m3∙m-3 of the actual VWC. For substrate-specific \\ncalibration, a single calibration equation could be used for a \\nsimilar model FDR sensor regardless of the substrate type (organic \\nor inorganic) (Nemali et al., 2007). Some of these sensors consist \\nof additional sensors that measure soil temperature and electrical \\nconductivity (EC) within the FDR sensor (Meter Group, 2018a, \\n2018b). These sensors have been used successfully to schedule \\nirrigation in several studies with highly porous soilless substrates \\nin nursery containers (Burnett and Van Iersel, 2008; Van Iersel et \\nal., 2010; Belayneh et al., 2013; Bayer et al., 2015; Montesano et al., \\n(\\n) (\\n)\\nln\\n/\\nf\\ni\\ni\\nf\\nt\\nRC\\nV\\nV\\nV\\nV\\nV\\n\\uf8ee\\n\\uf8f9\\n= −\\n−\\n+\\n−\\n\\uf8f0\\n\\uf8fb\\nFigure 3.

Improvements in \\nplant growth, reduction in water usage, and fewer incidences of \\npests and diseases were reported.\\nTime domain reflectometry\\nThe TDR technology was initially used to find the break in power \\nlines. Instead of manually inspecting a power line, a pulse is sent \\nalong the cable, and the time taken for the pulse to reflect indicates \\nthe precise point where the cable is broken. A TDR sensor works \\nsimilarly by sending electromagnetic waves from the pulse \\ngenerator of a cable tester to diffuse in the substrate where there is \\na parallel pair transmission line (Topp et al., 1984; Nobori, 1996). \\nElectromagnetic waves are diffused through a coaxial cable to \\na probe inserted in a substrate. Some of these electromagnetic \\nwaves are reflected at the beginning of the probe due to impedance \\ndifferences between the cable and the probe, whereas the rest of \\nthe waves diffuse through the probe until they reach the end of the \\nprobe where they are reflected (Noborio et al., 1996). Therefore, \\ndielectric permittivity can be calculated considering that the \\ntransmission velocity is determined from the known length of the \\ntransmission line in the substrate using (Topp et al., 1984):\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n/\\nKa\\n= ct l\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n(2)\\nwhere Ka is the soil dielectric constant, c the velocity of an \\nelectromagnetic signal in free space (i.e. speed of light, 3 x 108 \\nm∙s-1), t the travel time of the voltage pulse and l the length of \\nthe soil transmission line (mm). Since substrate water content is \\nthe main factor that alters the dielectric permittivity (Ka), VWC \\ncan be calculated using (Topp et al., 1980):\\n2\\n2\\n4\\n2\\n6\\n3\\nVWC \\n 5.3 10\\n2.92 10\\n –  5.5 10  \\n4.3 10  \\na\\na\\na\\nK\\nK\\nK\\n−\\n−\\n−\\n−\\n= −\\n×\\n+\\n×\\n×\\n+\\n×\\n(3)\\nThe specifications, advantages and disadvantages of TDR \\nsensors are further outlined in Table 1.\\nInfluence of substrate properties on dielectric \\npermittivity\\nThe dielectric permittivity may be influenced by factors other \\nthan the VWC (Smith and Mullins, 2000; Lukanu and Savage, \\n2006). Studies have indicated that dielectric sensors may be \\naffected by the substrate temperature and EC (Scanlon et al., \\n2002; Bogena et al., 2007; Bittelli, 2010; 2011). However, the new \\ngeneration of VWC sensors have a built-in temperature sensor \\nthat corrects for error in VWC estimation due to temperature \\nchanges, for example, a model 5TM or TEROS 10 (Meter \\nGroup, Inc., Pullman, WA, USA).\\nIn a nursery, most substrates used as potting media are a \\nunique blend of organic and inorganic materials, and seedlings \\nare frequently irrigated with water-soluble fertilisers. This can \\nresult in an increased concentration of ions of fertiliser salts \\nnear the electromagnetic field of a dielectric probe which could \\nweaken the electromagnetic energy and affect the measured \\nVWC (Nemali et al., 2007; Rosenbaum et al., 2010). In a study \\nby Kizito et al. (2008), a measurement frequency of 70 MHz \\nmitigated the effects of EC and temperature on FDR sensors \\n(model EC-5 and ECH2O-TE, Meter Group). Latest FDR sensors \\nmeasure dielectric permittivity using an oscillator operating at a \\nfrequency of 70 MHz making this sensor insensitive to EC below \\n10 dS∙m-1 (Meter Group, 2018a, 2018b). To be able to measure \\nin substrates with EC greater than 10 dS∙m-1, substrate-specific \\ncalibration is a necessity, although such high EC is extremely \\nuncommon in nursery substrates since it will most likely cause \\nroot death in most plant species. Increasing measurement \\nfrequency to higher frequencies (i.e. 150 MHz) decreases the \\nsensor sensitivity to EC considerably; however, this increases \\nsensor cost due to the increase in sensor electronics. \\nThe effect of poor substrate-to-sensor contact caused by \\nuneven packing of substrate in containers has been reported \\nby Bogena et al. (2007), Nemali et al. (2007) and Van Iersel \\net al. (2010). This may be critical in some nurseries where \\nthe substrate is manually packed in small-volume containers \\nTable 1.

Tarara and Ham (1997) describe \\nthe technique in detail, and Fig. 4 shows a probe with needle \\nlength of 30 mm. A heater and a temperature probe (usually a \\nthermocouple) are used to determine the substrate volumetric \\nheat capacity, which can be converted into VWC using:\\n(\\n)\\n(\\n2\\n [ /\\n –  19.92\\n  2.51\\n/ 4.18\\nm\\nm\\nVWC\\nq\\ne r\\nT\\nx\\nπ\\n\\uf8f9\\n=\\n∆\\n+\\n\\uf8fb\\n \\n(4)\\nwhere q (J∙m-1) is the heat applied per unit length of the line \\nsource, e is the natural logarithm base, r (m) is the distance \\nbetween the heater probe and temperature probe, ∆Tm is the \\nmaximum temperature increase of the needle (°C) and xm is \\ndetermined by dividing the substrate bulk density by particle \\nsize (Song et al., 1998).\\nThe small compact size of the DNHP sensor enables \\nmeasurements of small substrate volumes such as water content \\naround a growing seed (Tarara and Ham, 1997). Bristow et al. \\n(1993) compared the VWC as measured using DNHP sensors \\nversus the VWC measured by gamma attenuation in repacked \\nsoil in the laboratory. The DNHP sensors estimated VWC to \\nwithin 0.04 m3∙m-3 of the gamma attenuation method at both \\nthe LL and DUL. However, large differences between VWC \\nmeasured with DNHP sensors versus using the gravimetric \\nmethod were observed by Tarara and Ham (1997) at high water \\ncontent. At water contents less than 0.30 m3∙m-3, the DNHP \\nprobe estimates were within 0.06 m3∙m-3 of the gravimetric \\nmethod. The probes of this sensor type are very fragile and \\nspecial care needs to be taken so that the distance between the \\nneedle probes does not alter (Campbell et al., 1991; Bittelli, \\n2010). A needle deflection of 1 mm may cause a 6% error in \\nVWC measurements (Song et al., 1998; Scanlon et al., 2002). \\nThe conversion of a temperature signal from analogue to digital \\nmay cause a measurement error in ∆Tm (Bristow et al., 1993; \\nSong et al., 1998). This, however, can be minimised by increasing \\nthe datalogger sampling frequency by using a high resolution \\ndatalogger and applying sufficient power to the heater probe \\nso that ∆Tm exceeds 0.5°C. This sensor is also susceptible to \\nsubstrate temperature gradients (Scanlon et al., 2002), which \\nmay be significant in a nursery environment, and therefore \\nprecise substrate temperature measurements are needed. For \\nthese reasons, this type of sensor should be used with caution in \\nscheduling nursery irrigation, and, in most cases, is not practical.\\nmeaSURINg The SUbSTRaTe waTeR pOTeNTIal\\nThe concept of soil water potential is not new. As early as \\n1908, the first attempts to measure soil water potential were \\nconducted using the Livingston disc (Crawford, 2015). A dry \\nceramic disc would be weighed, then placed in soil so that it \\nequilibrated with the surroundings. After equilibration, it was \\nremoved, cleaned and weighed again. Soil water potential was \\nthen calculated using the water retention curve of the disc. \\nOver 100 years later, there have been many advances in soil \\nwater potential sensor technology, but these sensors still rely on \\nwater potential equilibration. Most commercially available soil \\nwater potential sensors accurately measure within the 0 to −100 \\nkPa range, which is ideal for most nursery crops since they \\ngenerally exhibit signs of water stress at matric potential less \\nthan −100 kPa. Different techniques for measuring soil water \\npotential in small-volume seedling containers are examined \\nand summarised in Table 2.\\nTensiometers\\nIn 1960, a liquid calibration technique called tensiometry was \\ndiscovered (Charlesworth, 2005). This method, along with \\nsoil psychrometry, was and still is the only direct method \\nof measuring soil water potential. If correctly installed, a \\ntensiometer is the most accurate soil water potential sensor in \\nwet substrate (0 to −90 kPa) (Charlesworth, 2005; Bittelli, 2010). \\nFor an in-depth understanding of tensiometer measurement \\ntheory, see Smith and Mullins (2000) and Bittelli (2010). The \\nadvantages and disadvantages of tensiometers are outlined \\nin Table 2. Small tensiometers fitted with transducers to \\nmeasure and control the water potential in small-volume \\nsoilless substrates were reported by Bittelli (2010). A schematic \\ndiagram of such a tensiometer is shown in Fig. 5, with a \\ndiameter of 5 mm for an easy fit in a small-volume container. \\nThe transducer is used to convert the tensiometer tension to an \\nelectrical signal that may be sensed by a control unit.\\nWhen tensiometers are used, precautionary measures are \\nnecessary to ensure direct contact between the porous ceramic \\ntensiometer tip and the substrate, and correct positioning \\nof the sensor. If the substrate shrinks, or the tensiometer is \\ndisturbed, this contact may be interrupted after which air \\nmay enter and break the water column resulting in inaccurate \\nmeasurements. In soilless substrates, fine roots might develop \\naround the ceramic tip. This is common when the substrate \\ndries out and the ceramic tip becomes an unreliable but \\nassured water source (Meter Group, 2009). When the substrate \\nbecomes drier than −90 kPa, cavitation occurs, where \\nliquid water pressure inside the tensiometer tube changes \\nto water vapour pressure causing spontaneous evaporation \\nand formation of air bubbles as described by Bittelli (2010). \\nHowever, the new commercially available tensiometers can \\nmeasure up to −500 kPa without cavitation, for example, a \\nmodel T5x mini tensiometer (Meter Group).

These \\ntensiometers consist of a swelling polymer that creates a \\npositive pressure, and when the substrate is wet it absorbs \\nwater, creating a pressure offset. These tensiometers are, \\nhowever, not yet well researched for use in nursery soilless \\nsubstrates. Charlesworth (2005) reported on equitensiometers \\nthat use the principle of dielectric sensors to measure the \\nwater potential. These sensors do not require substrate-specific \\ncalibration since they measure the water potential of the \\nceramic material and not the surrounding substrate. \\nheat dissipation sensors\\nAs early as 1940, Shaw and Baver (1940) proved that soil water \\npotential could be inferred from the rate of heat dissipated \\nin the soil, and many sensors have been developed based on \\nthis relationship. Flint et al. (2002) described heat dissipation \\nprobe measurement theory in detail and a sensor is shown in \\nFig. 6. The sensor has a ceramic cup which equilibrates with the \\nsubstrate. Following equilibration, a heating element is heated \\nfor a specific period, and a change in the substrate temperature is \\nthen measured. The temperature change depends on the thermal \\nconductivity of the ceramic cup, which is affected by the VWC \\nof the substrate (Flint et al., 2002; Scanlon et al., 2002; Bittelli, \\n2010).

Instruments like pressure chambers and porometers are being usedto quantify crop water stress under ﬁeld conditions, but their use is limitedbecause of the numerous time-consuming measurements that must be made.The application of thermal indices involving canopy temperature for monitoringcrop water stress and irrigation scheduling has been demonstrated by severalresearchers in the last ﬁve decades since the evolution of portable infraredthermometers in the 1960s.

However, different plant physiological as well as micro-climatic factors like solar radiation, turbulence, air temperature and humiditymust inﬂuence the canopy temperature at the time of observation. Hence, stoma-tal conductance and transpiration rates cannot be estimated by canopy tempera-ture alone. In other words, canopy temperature alone is not enough to makeestimates of plant water status. For this reason many researchers have attemptedto normalize the canopy temperature to account for the inﬂuence of other variableM. K.

The difference between canopytemperature and air temperature (canopy-air temperature difference, CATD) wasthe ﬁrst and one of the most commonly used thermal indices to quantify cropwater stress. The summation of CATD over some critical period in the crop’s lifecycle was termed as stress degree day (SDD). Similarly, the difference betweencanopy temperature of stressed and non-stressed plants has been used as an indexcalled temperature stress day (TSD). The “canopy temperature variability” (CTV)takes into account the spatial variability of canopy temperature in crop ﬁeld whichwas found to be higher in stressed plant than that of non-stressed plant. Thetemperature-time threshold (TTT) method assumes that the stress is not occurringin the crop until the canopy temperature reaches certain threshold value andcalculates the amount of time that canopy temperature is greater than temperaturethreshold to quantify moisture stress. The crop water stress index (CWSI) furthernormalizes the canopy-air temperature difference with vapour pressure deﬁcit ofair. The calculation of CWSI quantiﬁes the moisture stress of a plant as acomparison of its canopy temperature with that of a non-water-stressed plantand a maximum stressed plant with respect to their differences from the ambientair temperature at a given vapour pressure deﬁcit. Conceptually, CWSI of anon-stressed and fully stressed (non-transpiring) plant is 0 and 1, respectively.The water deﬁcit index (WDI) integrated the percent vegetation coverage andcanopy temperature to compensate the effect of soil background that interferes inthe remote measurement of canopy temperature through infrared thermometry.The“BiologicallyIdentiﬁedOptimalTemperatureInteractiveConsole(BIOTIC)” is an irrigation protocol that provides irrigation scheduling basedupon measurements of canopy temperatures and the temperature optimum ofthe crop species of interest. But some critical issues like impact of rapid ﬂuctua-tion in radiation and wind speed on crop water stress, crop to crop variability instress tolerance and the requirement of stress at particular phenophases of somecrops have not been duly focused. Thus the canopy temperature-based waterstress indices have limited application in irrigation scheduling at ﬁeld scale.However, with advancement of satellite-based optical and thermal remote sensingin recent years, there is a renewed interest in thermal indices for crop stressmonitoring.KeywordsInfrared thermometry · Canopy air temperature difference (CATD) · Stress degreeday (SDD) · Canopy temperature variability (CTV) · Temperature stress day(TSD) · Crop water stress index (CWSI) · Water deﬁcit index (WDI)366M. K. Nanda et al.14.1IntroductionWater stress is one of the most common types of plant stress and is often associatedwith reduced availability water from soil and during periods of high evaporativedemand of atmosphere associated with higher ambient temperature and vapourpressure deﬁcit. The negative effects of water stress on crop yield are both cosmo-politan and substantial, reducing yields in all cropping systems and regions world-wide. Generally, the production is adversely affected when a crop undergoes longerperiod of stress during its life cycle, although some plants may require a period ofwater stress to initiate reproductive development. An increase in plant water stress(decreasing plant water potential) occurs when an imbalance exists between theamount of water absorbed by the roots and the amount lost through transpiration.The degree of stress that develops is a function of the plant’s environment. Popularmethods that include pressure chamber and porometer that are being adopted toquantify crop moisture stress under ﬁeld conditions have relied observations on asingle plant or plant part. The pressure chamber measures leaf water potential ofsample leaves removed from the growing plant (Correia et al. 2001). Porometer isfrequently used for in situ measurement of stomatal conductance using portablechamber system (Turner 1991). Both the methods have potential to characterize cropwater stress under ﬁeld condition. However, these methods require numerous time-consuming measurements that limit their large-scale ﬁeld application. However, forsmall plot research, these and similar methods provide useful information (Reginato1983). Since the last few decades, the use of canopy temperature has received muchattention for characterizing plant water stress with evolution of portable infraredthermometer (Idso 1982; Jackson et al. 1977, 1981).14.2Basic PrincipleThe plant leaves absorb a certain fraction of the incident radiation and partition thisenergy into three outgoing streams: reradiation, convective heat exchange with theair and evaporation of water or transpiration. In case of plant leaf, the heat conduc-tion is too small to be considered signiﬁcant, and for steady-state situations, theenergy storage term is zero. Whenever water is evaporated from a leaf, the latent heatof evaporation is drawn from the leaf, cooling it down. Under water deﬁcitconditions, stomata of leaves close in response to loss of turgor pressure (Kramer1983), causing a lowering of transpiration rate. The dissipation of energy throughlatent heat is reduced leading to a positive energy balance. As the temperature ofplant canopy is a manifestation of canopy energy balance, a water-stressed canopy ishotter than a well-watered one under the same environmental conditions. Testi et al.(2008) was of the view that the temperature of a canopy deviates from air tempera-ture, in a way that is strictly dependent on the rate of transpiration under the sameenvironmental conditions.14Canopy Temperature-Based Water Stress Indices: Potential and Limitations367The energy budget of individual leaf in a plant canopy has been analysed in detailby Gates (1980). The empirical derivation of leaf temperature by Gates showed thatfor a leaf of characteristic dimension of 0.05 m and an internal resistance to waterloss of 200 m s1 at air temperature 30 C, wind speed 1 m s1 and relative humidity50% the leaf temperature is 26 C when the radiation absorbed by the leaf is419 W m2. The leaf temperature is increased to 31.3 C when the radiationabsorption is 698 W m2, other conditions remaining similar. The non-transpiringleaf under similar conditions would have a temperature of 28.7 and 34.6 C,respectively. Thus, the empirical analysis of Gates suggests that sunlit leaveswould be warmer than air, whereas the lower-shaded leaves would be cooler thanair, and transpiration was very important in the energy budget of plants.14.3Leaf Temperature Versus Canopy TemperatureThe literature concerning leaf temperatures dates back at least to the early part of theeighteenth century. Jackson (1982) made a thorough review of the history of leaftemperature measurement and found that the leaf temperatures were higher than theair temperature in majority of the earlier reports. The earlier measurements involvedclamping of sensors to the leaves or wrapping of un-detached leaves around thesensors. The major limitations in those measurements were that the leaves were nottrue representative of the whole canopy. The leaves were mostly near the top of plantunder direct sunlight. As the quantity of absorbed radiation is the most inﬂuencingparameter in the energy budget of the leaf, the position of leaf in the plant stand(upper or lower leaf) is an important criterion in measurement of leaf temperature.Secondly, there was no standard location suggested for recording air temperature.Tanner (1963) was among the ﬁrst researchers who studied canopy temperature withthe help of infrared thermometry for monitoring plant water stress. Tanner was of theview that the temperature of individual leaf would fail to represent the status of theplant as a whole. A leaf with the surface normal to incident solar radiation will be at asubstantially higher temperature than a leaf that has a large angle of incidence or onethat is shaded. Thus, there is no single leaf temperature value that represents the plantto be useful for any given research problem. Nevertheless, the measurement ofindividual leaf temperature with contact thermometers is cumbersome and tedious.Furthermore, either attaching or inserting thermal sensors may affect the planttemperature that is to be measured. Hence, for studying response of crops to moisturestress, canopy temperature that represents the averaged condition of both sunlit andshaded leaves is a more acceptable parameter than that of leaf temperature.14.4Infrared ThermometryInfrared thermometer integrates the thermal radiation from all exposed surfaces inthe ﬁeld of view (FOV) of the instrument that included the plant surface and exposedsoil surfaces into a single measurement and converts it into temperature unit. Tanner368M. K. Nanda et al.(1963) deﬁned temperature measured with an infrared thermometer as the black-body temperature that would produce the radiation entering the instrument fromplant parts in the ﬁeld of view. However, the target surface may include soil surfaceexposed through the layers of vegetation.14.4.1 Principles of Infrared ThermometryThe principle of infrared thermometer is based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law whichstates that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a blackbody across allwavelengths per unit time (also known as the black-body radiant emittance) isdirectly proportional to the fourth power of the blackbody’s thermodynamic temper-ature T:For blackbody,Rblackbody ¼ σ T4ð14:1ÞFor greybody,Rgreybody ¼ ε σ T4ð14:2ÞThe constant of proportionality σ is called the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Thevalue of the constant is 5.67 x 108 W m2 K4. A blackbody absorbs all radiationincident upon it, and its emissivity is also maximum. For the blackbody absorptivity,(a) ¼ emissivity (ε) ¼ 1. An object that does not absorb all the incident radiationand emits less energy than a blackbody is known as grey body. These grey bodies arecharacterized by their emissivity. The conventional IR thermometers work in wave-length range of 8–14 micrometre, the range in which most of the earth objects havehigh emissivity (ε ¼ 0.94 to 0.98).14.4.2 Errors Associated with IR ThermometryThere are different types of error associated with the IR thermometry. The ﬁrst erroris due to interference of atmospheric radiation. According to Monteith and Szeicz(1962), the total upward long-wave radiation (RT) from a surface with emissivity (ε)may be written as the sum of thermal infrared radiation emitted by the object and thepart of atmospheric radiation reﬂected by it.RT ¼ ε σ Ts4 þ ð1εÞ Ra ¼ ε σ ðTs∗Þ4ð14:3Þwhere Ts is the true temperature of the target surface, Ra is the atmospheric radiationreceived by the surface and Ts* is the apparent temperature of the surface assumingε ¼ 1.14Canopy Temperature-Based Water Stress Indices: Potential and Limitations369The difference between the true temperature and apparent temperature has beenderived by Monteith and Szeicz (1962) asTs  Ts∗ ﬃ RT  RsðÞ 1  EðÞ4 E σ Ts3ð14:4ÞThe apparent radiative temperature was about 0.2 C less than the true tempera-ture for vegetation and water surface and as high as 1.5 C less than the truetemperature for a bare soil. Another possible source of error is due to the radiativeﬂux divergence or the loss of radiation in the path for the surface to the sensor.Monteith and Szeicz (1962) opined that the surface temperature of turf may beunderestimated by about 1 C during the day and overestimated by about 0.2 Cduring night. For bare soil, the difference may reach 2 to –3 C during the day. Thethird source of variation of apparent surface temperature might be due to direction ofmeasurement with respect to sun’s position and angle of measurement. Here, solarzenith, measurement zenith and azimuth angle inﬂuence the measurement. Monteithand Szeicz (1962) studied the inﬂuence of measurement geometry and found that inthe direction sun (azimuth ¼ 0), the radiometer saw patches of grass completelyshaded by vertical irregularities of the canopy, whereas at azimuth ¼ 180, all visibleleaves were fully illuminated and therefore relatively warm as the sunlit part of thecanopy is expected to be warmer than the shaded part. The temperature of the surfacealso decreased at solar zenith >70, showing that the grass blades were cooler at theirtips than deeper in the cover.Kimes et al. (1980) opined that the thermal infrared sensor response to emissionsfrom vegetation canopies may deviate signiﬁcantly from that expected for aLambertian surface (ideal diffusion surface). They obtained a difference of as greatas 13 C, when going from a viewing zenith angle of 0 to one of 80 for wheatcanopy of leaf area index 1.5. The measured difference at different measurementzenith angle was function of vegetation canopy geometry and the vertical tempera-ture distribution of the canopy components.The errors associated with IR thermometry are appeared to be highly variablewith respect to time of measurement (solar angle), measurement geometry (angle,direction and distance of measurement) and ﬁeld of view (FOV). Kirkham (2005)opined that the overall error generally varied from 0.5 to 1.5 C. By viewing thetarget obliquely, one would ensure that maximum amount of vegetation remainswithin the FOV of the IR sensor. Furthermore, the inﬂuence of the sun’s angle thatwould affect the target temperature may be minimized by taking readings fromdifferent directions. Jackson et al. (1981) took eight measurements four facing theeast and four facing the west between 1340 and 1400 local time at an angle of 30 torepresent the canopy temperature of wheat. Kirkham (2005) also preferred the sameviewing angle, and they held the thermometer 1.2 m away from the crop (corn)canopy.370M. K. Nanda et al.14.5Application of Infrared Thermometry in Stress MonitoringThe energy budget of plant leaf involves three modes of heat transfer, i.e. byradiation, convection and transpiration. Aston and Van Bavel (1972) used infraredthermometry to record an increase in canopy temperature as a result of increasedshort-wave and long-wave radiant loads on leaf arrays. They compared temperatureincrease of different surfaces and reported that the surface temperature increased by2.5, 0.5 and 2.0 C in dry blotting paper, wet blotting paper and leaves of thesouthern pea (Vigna sinensis), respectively. Such increase in temperature of artiﬁcialand real leaves has also been predicted by the leaf energy balance-soil waterdepletion model with an accuracy of 1 and 5% for the artiﬁcial and real leaves,respectively. Gates (1980) gave a detailed account of energy budget of leaf andderived that the leaf temperature is inﬂuenced by cooling produced by the evapora-tion of liquid water to water vapour in the mesophyll and its diffusion through thestomata and across the boundary layer to the free air beyond the leaf. Thus, thecanopy temperature that represents the average condition of all the leaves of the plantwould indicate the transpiration status of the plant as a whole.Complications arise while interpreting canopy temperature recorded from ﬁeldmeasurement because of plant physiological as well as microclimatic factors likeradiation, turbulence, air temperature and humidity that inﬂuence the canopy tem-perature at any particular time of observation in crop ﬁeld. Thus, the stomatalconductance and transpiration rate that represent plant water status cannot beestimated by measuring the canopy temperature alone. Hence, many researchersattempted to normalize leaf and canopy temperature to account for the inﬂuence ofthe environmental condition during the period of measurement.14.5.1 Canopy-Air Temperature Difference (CATD) and StressDegree Day (SDD)One of the most widely used parameters for normalization of environmental factorsin canopy temperature-based stress monitoring approach is air temperature. Erhler(1973) was among the ﬁrst few researchers who described the relation between leaf-air temperature difference and plant water stress. He used ﬁne wire thermocouplesimbedded in cotton leaves to measure leaf temperature on well-watered plants andconcluded that within an irrigation cycle, main long-term changes in cotton(Gossypium) are progressive leaf dehydration and consequent stomatal closure.During this drying period, if the leaf continues to absorb the same amount of energythroughout the cycle, it will heat up gradually. Consequently, a long-term measure-ment of leaf temperature (TL) is an indirect guide to stomatal aperture and mightserve as an indicator of the need for irrigation. A simultaneous measurement of airtemperature (TA) would help computing leaf-air temperature differences (ΔT ¼ TL –TA). These differences could be related to soil water depletion. But he also opinedthat other factors like air temperature, vapour pressure, wind speed, radiation andleaf resistance would be intimately related to transpiration and stomatal aperture and14Canopy Temperature-Based Water Stress Indices: Potential and Limitations371thus could regulate leaf temperature (TL). It was evident from the study of Linacre(1967) that the leaf and air temperature are highly correlated. He suggested that theplants had an optimum temperature for growth. When the air temperature falls belowthe optimum temperature, the plant canopy will become warmer than air. If the airtemperature is above the optimum value, the plant canopy will be cooler than air.Several authors have referred it as “equality temperature” or “crossover tempera-ture”. Blad and Rosenberg (1976) observed that the crossover temperature varieswidely under advective conditions in case of alfalfa and corn. The effects ofenvironmental factors on TL must be determined or held constant before TL or ΔTdata can be used for irrigation scheduling.Quantiﬁcationofplantstressthroughinfraredthermometrywasﬁrstdemonstrated by Idso et al. (1977) and Jackson et al. (1977). They proposed thatthe difference between the temperature of a plant canopy and the temperature of thesurrounding air (TC – TA) might be an indicator of the water status of wheat, sincewater stress induces partial closure of stomata and reduces transpiration. This allowssunlit leaves to warm above ambient air temperature as it absorbs energy from thesun. They quantiﬁed the crop water stress in terms of stress degree day (SDD) whichmay be deﬁned as the summation of canopy-air temperature difference (TC – TA)over some critical period in the life cycle of crop much like the concept of growingdegree day (GDD).SDD ¼XNn¼i Tc  TcðÞið14:5Þwhere “i” to “N” is the period under study. The TC – TA should be recorded duringmid-afternoon (about 2 p.m.), and the air temperature was deﬁned as the temperaturemeasured at 150 cm above the soil.Idso et al. (1977, 1978) applied the concept of SDD to yield prediction. They haveconsidered the period between the appearance of heads and awns to the end of plantgrowth as the critical period for SDD summation for grain crop like wheat, while fora forage crop such as alfalfa, the dry matter production per unit leaf area was a linearfunction of SDD summed over the entire period of vegetative growth.Jackson et al. (1977) applied the concept of SDD to irrigation scheduling andprovided the framework for possible automation of irrigation scheduling applyingthe concept of SDD over larger areas by using airborne thermal scannermeasurements.Reginato et al. (1978) successfully applied the concept of stress degree day toalfalfa, for predicting its forage yield as well as grain yield. Walker and Hatﬁeld(1979) obtained an inverse relationship between SDD and ﬁnal yield of beans.Helyes et al. (2006) also observed that the accumulated SDD during ﬂoweringseason had inverse relationship with the yield of snap bean. They opined that each1 degree higher SDD might cause 90–130 kg ha1 yield loss. All these studiesshowed that the SDD model illustrated the effect of moisture stress on eventual yieldof crop.372M. K. Nanda et al.Idso et al. (1981) presented TC – TA and vapour pressure deﬁcit (VPD) data forseveral crops and showed that the relationship between TC – TA and VPD, for well-watered crops under clear-sky conditions, was linear. Diaz et al. (1983) noted thatevapotranspiration was inversely and linearly related to the cumulative SDD valuesfor a variety of crops grown under water-stressed conditions. Canopy to air temper-ature difference is also correlated to soil moisture content and stem water potential ofpeach orchards (Wang and Gartung 2010).14.5.2 Temperature Stress Day (TSD)The difference between canopy temperature of stressed and non-stressed plants hasalso been used as an index to quantify moisture stress. The earlier studies of Tanner(1963) revealed a possible maximum temperature difference of 3 C betweenirrigated and unirrigated potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) due to stomatal closure.Gardner et al. (1981a) suggested that a relative measure of plant water status can beobtained from the temperature difference between a well-watered plot and a stressedplot. They referred this temperature difference to as “temperature stress day” (TSD).Irrigations could be initiated when the stress plot reached a predetermined tempera-ture above the well-watered crop. They found parabolic curve between difference inleaf water potential (Δψ) and difference in canopy temperature between stressed andnon-stressed plant (TSD) of grain sorghum. During initial phases of moisture stress,the transpiration is reduced leading to increase in canopy temperature and therebyincrease in TSD up to a value of about 4 C. Beyond that point, transpiration fromthe stressed plants is restricted sufﬁciently to cause a slight increase in the leaf waterpotential (ψ), but at the same time, TSD continued to increase because transpirationwas restricted and more of the absorbed radiation caused heating of the plant.However, the stress was not always indicated in sorghum whenever the TSD wasgreater than 0, since the TSD of non-stressed crop varied about mean 0 and standarddeviation of 0.3. Clawson and Blad (1982) used TSD values of 1.0–3.0 to initiateirrigation of corn. Gardner et al. (1981b) also correlated corn grain yields with TSDof plants grown under several irrigation regimes and successfully used daily middayTSD values during the pollination and grain-ﬁlling stages to predict grain yield withan accuracy of 10%.The appealing simplicity of the TSD was that it only required simultaneousmeasurement of canopy temperatures of a stressed and a well-watered ﬁeld ofsame crop and soil type. No other measurements of other atmospheric or plantparameters were required to calculate TSD. However, Clawson et al. (1989)suggested that the TSD is not an environmentally independent index, it has strongdependency with the vapour pressure deﬁcit of air, and thus it cannot be universallyapplied.14Canopy Temperature-Based Water Stress Indices: Potential and Limitations37314.5.3 Canopy Temperature Variability (CTV)Studies on canopy temperature have revealed that the spatial variability of canopytemperature in water-stressed crop was higher than that of non-stressed crop(Gardner et al. 1981b; Clawson and Blad 1982; Nielsen and Gardner 1987). Thisformed the basis of the “canopy temperature variability” (CTV) approach as a toolfor determining crop water stress. However, the CTV approach was originallysuggested by Aston and Van Bavel (1972). They found that the standard deviationsof the canopy temperature were 0.3 C for well-watered corn plots, while it wasabout 4.2 C for water-stressed plots. The large variation in canopy temperature as aresult of changing environmental factors (e.g. air temperature and radiation)suggested the use of in-ﬁeld temperature variations due to differential drying ofnon-homogeneous soil as an indicator of plant water status.Gonzalez-Dugo et al. (2006) made a detailed study on applicability of CTVconcept to different levels of moisture stress and observed that at low moisturestress CTV in ﬁeld was relatively small, whereas at moderate stress level, CTV washighly sensitive to water stress. However, at high stress level, assessment of moisturestress from CTV was poor and not recommendable. The major limitation of CTVconcept is that the degree of uniformity of the root zone water availability of the ﬁeldmight differ from one another. This makes the application of threshold value(of CTV) or its empirical relationship with other stress indices difﬁcult.14.5.4 Time-Temperature Threshold (TTT)The TTT method assumes that stress is not occurring in the crop until it reaches thetemperature threshold or Tcritical and calculates the amount of time that canopytemperature (Tc) is greater than Tcritical. Upchurch et al. (1996) received US patentno. 5,539,637 for an irrigation management system that was based on this optimalleaf temperature for enzyme activity and a climate-dependant time threshold. Theytermed it as “temperature-time threshold” (TTT) method of irrigation scheduling. Inthis approach, every minute the canopy temperature exceeds, the threshold tempera-ture is added up to get cumulative value of TTT. An irrigation of a ﬁxed depth isscheduled when the TTT exceeds the time threshold at the end of the day. The TTTapproach can be mathematically expressed asTTT ¼X24h¼0 h, when Tc > Tcriticalð14:6ÞThe TTT approach has been successfully applied as a precision irrigation sched-uling tool. The “Biologically Identiﬁed Optimal Temperature Interactive Console(BIOTIC)” is an irrigation protocol that provides irrigation scheduling based uponmeasurements of canopy temperatures and the temperature optimum of the cropspecies of interest. The BIOTIC protocol has been demonstrated to be an effectiveirrigation scheduling method for several crop species in both semiarid and humid374M. K. Nanda et al.environments (Mahan et al. 2005). However, it requires real-time monitoring ofcanopy temperature and judicious selection of critical temperature which is expectedto be crop, climate and growth speciﬁc. Wanjura et al. (1995) described threemethods for the determination of time thresholds: (1) empirical method based onﬁeld testing of multiple time thresholds for irrigation and the selection of thethreshold that optimized crop performance, (2) empirical analysis of historical cropcanopy temperatures for a crop grown under well-watered conditions and (3) theo-retical determination of canopy temperatures of well-watered crop from energybalance analysis.14.5.5 Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI)The canopy temperature-based variables, namely, CATD (or SDD), CTV or TSD, asdiscussed earlier are aimed at normalizing canopy temperature with the air tempera-ture. However, the evapotranspirative demand that determines the water stress incrop plant to a considerable extent is regulated by vapour pressure deﬁcit of ambientair. The crop water stress index (CWSI) is a promising tool that further normalizesCATD with vapour pressure deﬁcit (VPD) to quantify crop water stress (Jacksonet al. 1981; Idso et al. 1981; Idso 1982; Jackson 1982). The calculation of CWSI isbased on two baselines: the non-water-stressed baseline represented by a fullywatered crop and the maximum stressed baseline, which corresponds to anon-transpiring crop where the stomata are assumed to be fully closed. The cropwater stress index (CWSI) is conceptualized as the ratio of the distance of an actualTc–Ta data point above the non-stressed baseline to the distance from the baseline tothe upper limit, at a given VPD. Thus, a non-stressed plant had a CWSI value equalsto 0, while that of a fully stressed non-transpiring crop had a CWSI value of 1.0.14Canopy Temperature-Based Water Stress Indices: Potential and Limitations375According to Idso’s deﬁnition (Idso et al. 1981), the CWSI can be expressed asCWSI ¼ Tc  TaðÞ  D2D1  D2ð14:7Þwhere D1 is the maximum value of canopy and air temperature difference for a fullystressed crop (the maximum stressed baseline), D2 the lower limit canopy and airtemperature difference for a well-watered crop (the non-water-stressed baseline), Tcthe measured canopy surface temperature (C) and Ta the air temperature (C).There are two popular approaches to deﬁne non-water-stressed baselines fordetermination of CWSI. One is the empirical approach given by Idso et al. (1981),in which the empirical relationship between the canopy-air temperature differences(Tc  Ta) and the vapour pressure deﬁcit (VPD) is established from ﬁeldmeasurements under different environmental conditions for a well-watered crop.The other approach by Jackson (1982) is based on the theoretically derived relation-ship between Tc  Ta and VPD following one-layer canopy energy balance model.14.5.5.1 Empirical ApproachFollowing Idso’s approach, the empirical formula for non-water-stressed baseline isrepresented asD2 ¼ A þ B:VPDð14:8Þwhere VPD is the air vapour pressure deﬁcit (in Pa), A is the intercept and B is theslope of the linear regression equation of the lower limit canopy and air temperaturedifference and the vapour pressure deﬁcit. Idso (1982) has given the regressioncoefﬁcients of non-water-stressed baselines for 26 different plant species for clear-sky conditions and for 6 of these plants, including one aquatic species he had alsogiven the regression coefﬁcients under cloudy or shaded conditions.The water-stressed baseline (D1) is a line plotted parallel to the x-axis with theassumption that the CATD remains unaltered by the changes in VPD under maxi-mum possible stress when the transpiration is completely stopped. It has beenobserved from VPD vs CATD regression line given by several researchers fordifferent crops that the canopy temperature is equal to the atmospheric temperaturewhen the atmosphere is completely saturated (i.e. VPD ¼ 0) as implied by positivevalue of the intercepts in the regression lines. This prompted Idso et al. (1981) toassume that even under completely saturated atmospheric condition, a positivevapour pressure gradient will exist between the foliage and the air, and thus, thetranspiration from the plant canopy will not be fully suppressed. They havesuggested extrapolating the VPD-CATD regression line beyond the atmosphericsaturation level into the negative VPD zone until it reaches the point where atmo-spheric vapour pressure is equal to the canopy vapour pressure.

Tojo Soler(1) and Gerrit Hoogenboom(1)(1)Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering. The University of Georgia.Griffin, Georgia, USA. Corresponding author E-mail: ctojo@uga.eduAbstractIrrigation scheduling is an important management practice for farmers who growirrigated crops. Effective irrigation is possible by regular monitoring of soil water andcrop development conditions in the field. However, this methodology requires frequentfield visits and, consequently, it is time consuming. Computer simulation models can bean important aid for irrigation scheduling, as they integrate the soil-plant-atmospherecomplex. The main objectives of this study were to determine the impact of differentirrigation scheduling regimes on cotton and peanut growth and development and toevaluate the application of a crop simulation model as a tool for irrigation scheduling.Two experiments were conducted in four rainout shelters, located at the Griffin Campusof The University of Georgia, during 2005 and 2006. Cotton was grown in 2005 andpeanut was grown in 2006. The CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton and CSM-CROPGRO-Peanutmodels were used to define the irrigation treatments by estimating the timing ofirrigation and the amount of water to apply. The irrigation event was triggered when theactual soil water content in the effective root zone dropped below a specific threshold ofthe available water content (AWC) and then irrigation was applied until the soil waterreached 100% of AWC. The irrigation treatments corresponded to 30%, 40%, 60% and90% of the irrigation threshold (IT). The models require daily weather data, includingmaximum and minimum temperature, solar radiation and precipitation as input. Actualweather data were used until the current date and the daily weather data for the past 10years were used to project until the end of the growing season. The cotton cultivar DP555 BG/RR was planted on May 17, 2005 and the peanut cultivar Georgia Green wasplanted on May 22, 2006. For both experiments, the soil water content was monitoredwith Time-Domain-Reflectometry (TDR) and with a soil profile probe (PR2/6, Delta-TDevices, Ltd.). The TDRs and PR2/6 probe were connected to data loggers.

Yield and yield components were obtained atfinal harvest. For cotton, the 30 and 40% IT treatments had significantly less number ofbolls/m2. The statistical analysis for lint yield showed that there were no significantdifferences between the 60 and 90% IT treatments. For cotton and peanut, low values ofaboveground biomass at harvest and yield were found for the 30 and 40% IT treatments.The study showed that the dynamic crop growth models CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton andCSM-CROPGRO-Peanut can be used for irrigation scheduling, but a variable irrigationmanagement depth needs to be incorporated in the model and a correct characterizationof the soil properties is needed.IntroductionCotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) are importantrow crops in Georgia and other southeastern states. In Georgia, cotton accounts forapproximately 560,000 ha of production per year. The average yield for the past 10years has been 740 kg ha-1 with a high inter-annual variability (Jost, 2006; NASS, 2007).Georgia is the number one peanut producing state in the USA, accounting for over 45%of the acreage and production. In 2006, 580,000 ha were planted and the averageobtained yield was 2,970 kg ha-1 (NASS, 2007).Within the strategies to improve cotton yield, irrigation scheduling is animportant management practice that can help to obtain high and stable yields. Mert(2005) studied the effects of water stress on cotton cultivars under irrigated and non-irrigated conditions and found that seed cotton yield and other yield related traits variedsignificantly among cultivars under non-irrigated conditions. Furthermore, growingcotton under non-irrigated conditions resulted in the production of shorter and weakerfibers with reduced micronaire. Pettigrew (2004), in a four year study conducted inMississippi, reported that irrigation delayed cutout, enabling the plants to prolongflowering later in the growing season compared with dryland plants. During the yearswhen significant moisture deficits occurred, the lint yield of rainfed plants was reduced25%, primarily because of a 19% reduction in the number of bolls. Irrigated plantsWorld Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2007:  Restoring Our Natural Habitat© 2007 ASCECopyright ASCE 2007World Environmental and Water Resources Congress  2007Copyright ASCE 2007World Environmental and Water Resources Congress  2007 World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2007 Downloaded from ascelibrary.org by KUNGLIGA TEKNISKA HOGSKOLA on 08/12/15.

Black et al. (1985); Pateland Golakiya (1988); Stirling et al. (1989) and Reddy et al. (2003) reported that peanutis most sensitive to water stress during flowering and pod filling. The flowering ratedepends on the irrigation frequency and is reduced when the water frequency is less thanonce every 6 days (Ishag, 1982). Peg elongation is delayed by drought (Boote andKetring, 1990); and adequate soil moisture in the pod elongation zone is critical for pegpenetration and the formation of pods (Reddy et al., 2003).Experiences with row-crop farmers in south Georgia indicates that newtechnologies could be considered as long as they do not take too much time, do notinterfere with field operations, are reliable, result in accurate recommendations, and arenot too expensive (Thomas et al., 2004). There are several, well-documented irrigationscheduling methods for proper soil water management, e.g., if water is replenishedwithin an appropriate time period before plants are stressed; irrigation has a benefit incrop production. The main goal of irrigation scheduling is to use water efficiently and toobtain high and stable yields. A new approach for determining irrigation schedulingconsists of using decision support and information systems, such as the DecisionSupport System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) (Tsuji et al., 1994; Jones et al.,2003; Hoogenboom et al., 2004). The DSSAT encompasses models for 27 differentcrops, including the CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton and –Peanut models. There are limitedstudies conducted using CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton and -Peanut models for irrigationscheduling aiming to obtaining high and stable yields. Most of the irrigation studies havebeen conducted under rainfed conditions, which means that supplemental water isprovided through irrigation, but only if needed and rainfall is inadequate to meet thedemands of the crop. However, there is insufficient information about the response ofcotton and peanut to different irrigation scheduling techniques when all waterapplications are completely controlled throughout the growing season. An understandingof the response of the individual cultivars to water deficit is also important to be able tosimulate cotton and peanut growth and to estimate water needs for irrigation.World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2007:  Restoring Our Natural Habitat© 2007 ASCECopyright ASCE 2007World Environmental and Water Resources Congress  2007Copyright ASCE 2007World Environmental and Water Resources Congress  2007 World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2007 Downloaded from ascelibrary.org by KUNGLIGA TEKNISKA HOGSKOLA on 08/12/15.

Cotton was grown in 2005 and peanut was grownin 2006. The cotton cultivar DP 555 BG/RR was planted on May 17, 2005. In eachrainout shelter, one irrigation treatment was applied. Each treatment had three replicates,corresponding to three individual rows. The rainout shelters were 12 m long and 4.6 mwide. The CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton model was used to define the treatments byestimating when to irrigate and how much water to apply. The irrigation event wastriggered when the actual soil water content in the effective root zone dropped below aspecific threshold of the available water content (AWC) and then irrigation was applieduntil the soil water reached 100% of AWC. The irrigation treatments corresponded to30%, 40%, 60% and 90% of the irrigation threshold (IT). Thus, the 30% IT was the leastirrigated treatment and the 90% IT was the most irrigated treatment. The plantpopulation for cotton was 111,000 plants per hectare. There were 5 rows spaced 0.9 mapart in each rainout shelter, with the two external rows as border rows. Plant spacingwas 0.1 m and the planting depth was 0.03 m. Fertilization was conducted following therecommendations based on the results of the soil analysis. Pests were controlled withspecific chemical applications. A plant growth regulator (mepiquat pentaborate) wasapplied at the flowering stage (July 20) with a dose of 1.1 kg ha-1.The peanut cultivar Georgia Green was planted on May 22, 2006. A similarmethodology to the cotton experiment was used for peanut using the CSM-CROPGRO-Peanut model to define the treatments by estimating when to irrigate and the amount ofwater to apply. The plant population for peanut was 222,000 plants per hectare. Therows were spaced 0.9 m apart, plant spacing was 0.05 m and the planting depth was 0.04World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2007:  Restoring Our Natural Habitat© 2007 ASCECopyright ASCE 2007World Environmental and Water Resources Congress  2007Copyright ASCE 2007World Environmental and Water Resources Congress  2007 World Environmental and Water Resources Congress 2007 Downloaded from ascelibrary.org by KUNGLIGA TEKNISKA HOGSKOLA on 08/12/15.

Fertilization was conducted following the recommendations based on the results ofthe soil analysis.Soil physical and chemical analysis was conducted at depths of 0.05, 0.15, 0.3,0.6 and 0.9 m. The soil was characterized by its high sand content (92%) in the profile.For both experiments, the soil water content was monitored with Time-Domain-Reflectometry (TDR) and with a soil profile probe (PR2/6, Delta-T Devices, Ltd.). TheTDR probes were 0.3 m long and probes were installed vertically while the PR2 probemeasured the soil water content at depths of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, and 1 m. The TDRsand PR2/6 probe were connected to separate data loggers to allow for continuousmonitoring of soil moisture.Phenology records were obtained on a daily basis. Growth analysis included,plant height, Leaf Area Index (LAI), dry matter weight for leaves, stems and roots. Forreproductive development of cotton, the boll position on the stem, the number of squaresand bolls, and boll and lint weight were recorded. For both crops, growth analysissamples were collected for 1 m of linear row, approximately every 18 days. All plantswere cut at the base and the individual plant components were separated and oven driedat 70oC until constant weight and then weighed. For the final harvest, 3 m of linear rowwas manually cut for each replicate and the plants were separated into the different plantcomponents similar to the procedures used for growth analysis.An analysis of variance was conducted to determine the effect of irrigationtreatment on cotton lint, seed cotton, the number of bolls at harvest, peanut pod yield,the number of pod, and aboveground biomass at harvest for both crops using the SAS-GLM procedure (SAS Institute, 2001).ResultsCottonFor 2005, the total amount of water applied through irrigation for the entiregrowing season, from planting to harvest was 272 mm for the 30% IT, 345 mm for the40% IT treatment, 610 mm for the 60% IT treatment, and 729 mm for the 90% ITtreatment (Figure 1a).

The statistical analysis for lint yield showed thatthere were no significant differences between the 60 and 90% IT treatments, since thedifference between these two treatments was only 6.7% (Table 1).

The method used permitted us to quantify, with accuracy, theeffect of the different irrigation treatments on cotton and peanut growth anddevelopment. For cotton, the highest lint yield was found for the treatments of 60 and90% IT. The 60% IT would conserve water compared to the 90% irrigation thresholdlevel. For peanut, the 90% IT determined the highest pod yield and pod number per unitof land. This study showed that the dynamic crop growth models CSM-CROPGRO-Cotton and -Peanut are promising tools for irrigation scheduling.

These systems incorporate on-site sensor data, remote sensing inputs, and advanced algorithms with spatial and temporal characteristics to compute precise crop water needs. The availability of variable rate irrigation (VRI) systems enables irrigation applications at a sub-field scale. The combination of an appropriate VRI system along with a precise decision support system would be ideal for improved CWP. The objective of this study was to compare and evaluate two decision support systems in terms of seasonal applied irrigation, crop yield, and CWP. This study implemented the Spatial EvapoTranspiration Modeling Interface (SETMI) model and the Irrigation Scheduling Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (ISSCADA) system for management of a center pivot irrigation system in a 58-ha maize-soybean field during the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons. The irrigation scheduling methods included: ISSCADA plant feedback, ISSCADA hybrid, common practice, and SETMI. These methods were applied at irrigation levels of 0, 50, 100, and 150% of the full irrigation prescribed by the respective irrigation scheduling method. Data from infrared thermometers (IRTs), soil water sensors, weather stations, and satellites were used in the irrigation methods. Mean seasonal irrigation prescribed was different among the irrigation levels and methods for the 2 years. The ISSCADA plant feedback prescribed the least irrigation among the methods for majority of the cases. The common practice prescribed the largest seasonal irrigation depth among the methods for three crop-year cases. The maize yield in rainfed was found to be significantly lower than the irrigated levels in 2020 since 2020 was a dry year. No significant differences were observed in crop yield among the different irrigation methods for both years. The CWP among the different irrigation methods ranged between 2.72 and 3.15 kg m−3 for 2020 maize, 1.03 and 1.13 kg m−3 for 2020 soybean, 3.57 and 4.24 kg m−3 for 2021 maize, and 1.19 and 1.48 kg m−3 for 2021 soybean. Deficit level (50%) had the largest irrigation water productivity in all crop-year cases in this study. The ISSCADA and SETMI systems were found to reduce irrigation applications as compared to the common practice while maintaining crop yield. This study was the first to implement the newly developed integrated crop water stress index (iCWSI) thresholds and the ISSCADA system for site-specific irrigation of maize and soybean in Nebraska.Similar content being viewed by othersIrrigation efficiency optimization at multiple stakeholders’ levels based on remote sensing data and energy water balance modellingArticle Open access18 March 2022Applications of Sensing to Precision IrrigationChapter © 2021Variable-rate irrigation management using an expert system in the eastern coastal plainArticle 04 January 2015Use our pre-submission checklistAvoid common mistakes on your manuscript.IntroductionPrecision irrigation aims for improved CWP by managing spatiotemporal crop water requirements in a field. Recent advances in sensing technologies, data processing systems, modeling approaches, and communication protocols facilitate the management of site-specific irrigation at a sub-field scale (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2019). Over the past decade, numerous precision irrigation technologies and methodologies have been developed and tested across different cropping systems (Barker et al., 2019; Bhatti et al., 2020; Haghverdi et al., 2016; Lena et al., 2020; Mendes et al., 2019; O’Shaughnessy et al., 2015; Osroosh et al., 2016; Stone et al., 2020; Sui & Yan, 2017; Taghvaeian et al., 2014; Thorp, 2020; Vories et al., 2020). While there is an abundance of precision irrigation tools, it is important to assess the suitability of these irrigation scheduling methods in terms of CWP, complexity, and economic viability (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2019). The downsides of precision irrigation include associated costs and lack of effective algorithms and real-time availability of data for irrigation scheduling (Evett et al., 2020a, 2020b, 2020c). Currently, site-specific irrigation systems are primarily utilized by producers to avoid application on non-arable areas of the field (Evans et al., 2013). The potential benefits include improved CWP, reduced leaching, and energy savings, which are yet to be demonstrated (Lo et al., 2016).Uniform rate irrigation and speed control VRI are easier to manage than zone control VRI and have the potential of incorporating sensor data and precision irrigation techniques for improving CWP. The flow rate of individual sprinklers along the lateral pipe does not vary with location in case of uniform rate or speed control VRI. Integrated sensing systems, advanced modeling tools, and irrigation scheduling algorithms will be beneficial for both site-specific and conventional irrigation methods (Thorp et al., 2022). Data streams for precision agriculture require temporal and spatial knowledge of soil, plant, and field characteristics. Precision irrigation technologies should be centered on plant water relations in the soil–plant-atmosphere-continuum for sustainable management of irrigation water (Zhang et al., 2021). Precision irrigation tools using sensor data integration, remote sensing inputs, and modeling approaches, have shown promise as effective decision support systems for irrigation management.Crop water stress can be estimated spatially and temporally using systems such as the ISSCADA system, which was developed and patented (Evett et al., 2014) by the USDA Agricultural Research Service in Bushland, TX. This system uses iCWSI to schedule irrigation and monitor crop water stress in the field. The iCWSI is computed by integrating the crop water stress index (Jackson et al., 1981) estimated for every minute between the daylight hours. Continuous measurement of canopy temperature is needed at different locations across the field to compute spatial iCWSI maps for the field. The spatial canopy temperature measurements can be obtained by mounting IRTs on moving irrigation systems (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2015, 2017, 2020; Evett et al., 2020b; Sui et al., 2017). A scaling algorithm was developed to estimate diurnal temperatures from data collected by the pivot-mounted IRTs by using stationary IRTs as a reference (Peters & Evett, 2004). The diurnal time series data are estimated using a one-time-of-day temperature reading taken during daylight hours (moving IRT sensors) and an equation that scales the temperature to a known reference temperature curve (measurements from the stationary sensors). In this way, diurnal temperature time series were determined for many footprint areas in the field. The diurnal temperature time series data are used to compute spatial iCWSI for the field and automate irrigation management using the ISSCADA system (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012). The ISSCADA system was found to adequately manage irrigation scheduling at a site-specific level in different climates (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2017; Stone et al., 2020; Sui et al., 2020; Vories et al., 2020). This system has built-in algorithms to convert weather, soil water sensing, and canopy temperature data into reliable irrigation decisions and automate the management of moving center pivot irrigation systems.The SETMI model (Geli & Neale, 2012; Neale et al., 2012) has the ability to estimate spatial crop water requirements and manage precision irrigation. Multiyear studies on site-specific irrigation were conducted using the SETMI model for maize and soybean in Nebraska (Barker et al., 2018, 2019; Bhatti et al., 2020). This model combines a reflectance-based crop coefficient evapotranspiration approach (water balance approach) with a two-source energy balance approach (Norman et al., 1995). The water balance approach computes the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI; Huete, 1988) from red and near-infrared bands and uses the relationships between basal crop coefficients and SAVI (Campos et al., 2017). The energy balance approach uses thermal infrared imagery to compute the latent heat flux and estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) at a spatial scale. Sensor-based soil water measurements from the root zone can also be used to update the water balance in the SETMI model (Bhatti et al., 2020). The water balance approach can forecast irrigation needs using historic weather data, which can prove beneficial to producers. The ISSCADA system and SETMI model have never been implemented on the same field in a research experiment for comparing their potential in site-specific irrigation management.The overall goal of the study was to implement two decision support systems for site-specific irrigation management and compare the crop yield and water productivity for maize and soybean in eastern Nebraska. The ISSCADA system used in-situ and ground-based proximal thermal sensing data, and the SETMI model used satellite imagery with neutron probe soil water data to compute crop water requirements. These precision irrigation methods were compared with the common irrigation scheduling method practiced by farmers in the area. The specific objectives included: (1) the comparison of different irrigation methods applied at four different irrigation levels in terms of crop yield and irrigation applied, (2) the assessment of CWP and two other water productivities among the different treatments, and (3) the investigation of the suitability of newly developed iCWSI thresholds for irrigation management of maize and soybean in eastern Nebraska.Material and methodsExperimental site and designThe study was conducted on a 58-ha maize-soybean research field located at the University of Nebraska’s Eastern Nebraska Research and Extension Center, NE, U.S.A. (centered at 41.172445°N, 96.478248°W) during the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons (Bhatti et al., 2022a). The field was irrigated using a seven-span, speed control enabled center pivot irrigation system (lateral length of 400 m), model Valley Irrigation 8000 (Valmont, Valley, NE), with the X-Tec center drive motors (capable of making a revolution in about 4 h). The sprinklers on the pivot lateral were Nelson spinners (model S3030, Nelson, Walla Walla, WA) installed on drops at a height of about 2.4 m from the ground and with a sprinkler spacing of 2.7 m. The field was divided into north and south halves managed under a maize-soybean rotation (Fig. 1). The soils in the field were classified as silt loam and silty clay loam (gSSURGO, Soil Survey Staff, 2018). The planting and harvesting dates were April 24 and October 13 for maize 2020, May 2 and September 28 for soybean 2020, April 28 and October 8 for maize 2021, and May 13 and October 21 for soybean 2021, respectively. Anhydrous ammonia injection applications were applied uniformly after the soybean harvest in the north half in 2020.Fig. 1Layout of experimental plots for 2020 and 2021 growing seasons. The irrigation methods included: A for ISSCADA plant feedback, B for ISSCADA hybrid, C for common practice, and D for SETMI. The irrigation levels were depicted by different color rings and included: 1 for Rainfed, 2 for Deficit, 3 for Full, and 4 for over. The irrigation method-level combinations were mentioned in each plot, where the upper row was 2020 label, and the lower row was 2021 label. Neutron access tubes, stationary soil water and IRT stations, and center pivot tire tracks were marked on the map. Labels ‘RB 1–2’ stands for radial blocks 1 and 2, and labels ‘SB 1–6’ stands for sector blocks 1 through 6. Outer four center pivot spans were also labeled in the figure. The IRTs mounted on the center pivot lateral were not marked on this map since they moved as the center pivot moved across the fieldFull size imageA total of 192 plots were designed for the field using eight radial zones (concentric zones) and 24 arc-wise plot boundaries (Fig. 1). The area under the outer four spans of the pivot was used for the experiment. The north and south halves had a total of 96 plots each. The plots were approximately rectangular with lengths ranging between 43 and 90 m, and a constant width of 28 m. The area of the plots ranged between 1205 m2 and 2630 m2. There were a total of 16 treatment combinations: four irrigation scheduling methods, and four irrigation levels. Each combination of an irrigation method-level had six replicates for each crop. The treatments were assigned to the experimental plots using a strip-block design with two treatment factors: irrigation scheduling methods and irrigation refill levels. More details on the different scheduling methods and refill levels are provided in the section ‘Irrigation management’ below. The 24 arc-wise sectors (14° sector angle) were assigned to six sector blocks with three sector blocks in each crop: west, center, and east sector blocks (Fig. 1). Each sector block included four arc-wise sectors, which were randomly assigned with the four irrigation scheduling methods. The eight radial zones (concentric zones shown in different colors in Fig. 1) were assigned to two radial blocks, and each radial block constituted two pivot spans. The inner four radial zones were assigned to radial block 1 and outer four radial zones were assigned to radial block 2. These radial zones were randomly assigned with four irrigation levels for each radial block. The irrigation methods were randomized between the four arc-wise sectors within each sector block for the second year of the study. In 2021, the irrigation levels were not randomized among radial blocks due to logistical reasons (needed reconfiguration of sprinkler nozzles).Experimental dataThermal sensingThe canopy temperature was sensed using IRTs (model SAP-IP IRT, Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX, USA) mounted on stationary posts and on brackets mounted on the center pivot lateral. The spectral range of the IRT was 8–14 μm with a 20° field of view. The outer two spans of the center pivot were used to mount eight IRTs: two IRTs each for the four irrigation levels. Each pair of IRTs were mounted about 6.1 m from the edges of the respective radial zone borders and pointed towards the center of the zone at oblique angles to nadir (see more details in Bhatti et al., 2022b). The IRTs were mounted on the pivot at a height of about 3.6 m from the ground using special mounting arms secured to the truss rods, which extended the field of view of the IRTs by about 3 m ahead of the pivot lateral when moving in the forward/clockwise direction.Stationary IRTs were installed near the centroid of one ISSCADA hybrid-full plot for each crop. These sensors were positioned at a nadir view angle and the height was manually adjusted to maintain a distance of about 1 m above the canopy. When the maize reached maximum crop height, the 1 m spacing between the sensor and maize canopy could not be maintained since the sensor height had to remain below the truss level to prevent damage. After this timeframe, the sensor height was between 0.3 and 0.5 m higher than the tassel of maize. The maximum height of the stationary IRT from the soil surface was about 3 m for maize and about 2.2 m for soybean. The data from the IRTs were recorded every five seconds and were averaged over 1 min. The 1 min data were transmitted using the wireless Zigbee communication protocol at a frequency of 2.54 GHz to a coordinator (model IRT-COR, Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX, USA). The coordinator routed the data through a USB connection to an embedded computer (model MXE-1401, Adlink Technology, Inc., San Jose, California USA) at the center pivot point. The embedded computer also had a serial connection to the CAMS (control) panel of the center pivot system and collects time-stamped data including the GPS location of the end-tower, the center pivot speed, pressure and voltage. A separate software system (ARSPivot) was installed on the embedded computer to download data from a nearby AgSense weather station and manages the data collected from the IRT network, the CAMS panel, distributed wireless network of the soil water sensors (discussed below), and the AgSense weather station to build a prescription map (Andrade et al., 2020).The center pivot system was moved around the field without water (dry scan) to collect data using the pivot mounted IRTs. A total of 16 dry scans in 2020 and 19 dry scans in 2021 were conducted to sense spatial canopy temperature data. The dry scans were mainly conducted between 10:00 AM and 5:30 PM. The scaling algorithm (Peters & Evett, 2004), incorporated in the ARSPivot software, was used by the ISSCADA system to estimate the diurnal canopy temperature for each one-time of day remote measurement recorded by each pair of IRTs mounted on the pivot lateral. Additionally, the algorithm uses a reference measurement from a stationary IRT to capture diurnal pattern in canopy temperature at one location in the field. Further, the algorithm scales the diurnal canopy temperature curve from stationary IRT to a predicted temperature curve for a remote location using ratio between the reference temperature and the remote location measurement, referenced to the predawn temperature (Peters & Evett, 2004). There were about 180 remote locations or canopy temperature measurements that were monitored by one moving IRT mounted on the pivot in a dry scan conducted at 100% speed. Data from the stationary IRTs were used to develop a reference temperature curve in the scaling algorithm. The integrated crop water stress index (iCWSI; O’Shaughnessy et al., 2020) was also computed by the ISSCADA system at each remote location for every minute during daylight hours from 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM. The iCWSI was computed using following equation as mentioned in O’Shaughnessy et al. (2017):$$iCWSI = { }\\\\mathop \\\\sum \\\\limits_{i = 1}^{N} \\\\frac{{\\\\left( {T_{c}^{^{\\\\prime}} - T_{a} } \\\\right) - \\\\left( {T_{c} - T_{a} } \\\\right)_{ll} }}{{\\\\left( {T_{c} - T_{a} } \\\\right)_{ul} - \\\\left( {T_{c} - T_{a} } \\\\right)_{ll} }}$$(1)where i is the ith time step, N is total number of 1 min steps between 9:00 AM and 7:00 PM, \\\\(T_{c}^{^{\\\\prime}}\\\\) is canopy temperature estimated using scaling algorithm, \\\\(T_{a}\\\\) is ambient air temperature, \\\\(\\\\left( {T_{c} - T_{a} } \\\\right)_{ll}\\\\) represents the lower limit of the canopy and air temperature differential, and \\\\(\\\\left( {T_{c} - T_{a} } \\\\right)_{ul}\\\\) represents the upper limit of the canopy and air temperature differential. The lower and upper limits of the canopy temperature and air temperature difference were computed using the theoretical approach (Jackson et al., 1981). The weather variables required for computing the upper and lower limits were acquired from an onsite AgSense weather station. All computations were automatically conducted by the ISSCADA system at midnight following a dry scan.A separate data analysis of the thermal data using iCWSI (Bhatti et al., 2022a) demonstrated that crop water stress could be detected before incurring crop yield loss. This was possible in a narrow range when the photosynthesis rate (and carbon assimilation) was limited by solar radiation (energy-limiting water stress), yet the leaf had abundant carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. In non-irrigated plots, the water stress progressed and stomatal conductance further decreased until photosynthesis was limited by carbon dioxide (carbon-dioxide-limiting water stress), in which case a yield reduction occurred (Fig. 2). A significant increase in daily carbon gain by a soybean plant was found when stomatal conductance and soil water content was high in the more recently released cultivars (Koester et al., 2016). Hence, the canopy temperature and stomatal conductance will vary with different cultivars and affect the carbon gained by the plant. More research is warranted on the energy limiting stress with different cultivars.Fig. 2Schematic of three conditions of water stress supported by data for integrated crop water stress index, evapotranspiration, and crop yield from soybean in 2020 (adapted from Bhatti et al., 2022a)Full size imageSoil water sensingA total of eight time-domain reflectometer (TDR) soil water sensors (model TDR315L, Acclima, Inc., Meridian, Idaho, USA) were installed horizontally at four depths (0.15, 0.30, 0.46, and 0.76 m) in two hybrid plots (one location per crop; Fig. 1). The four depths were selected to represent soil water profile of the root zone to a depth of 1 m. Three sensors were installed within 0.5 m of the ground surface to capture the dynamic nature of soil water in shallow depths. The soil water stations consisting of four TDR sensors were situated adjacent to the stationary IRTs in the same plot. The data was sensed at a frequency of 15 min and stored using a CR300 datalogger with an embedded RF407 radio (Campbell Scientific, Logan, Utah, USA). The data were transmitted wirelessly using the proprietary PakBus communication protocol and Yagi antennas (Campbell Scientific) operating at 900 MHz. Data were collected using a RF407 radio serving as a base station modem connected to the embedded computer.Soil water data from two neutron probes (model 503 Elite Hydroprobe, CPN, Concord, CA) were also monitored at multiple depths including 0.15, 0.46, 0.76, and 1.07 m. Since the representative volume of a soil water measurement from neutron probe is larger compared to TDR sensors, the depths of measurement for neutron probe were equally spaced to represent soil water profile to a depth of 1.2 m. The data were collected with a frequency of about 3 weeks. For each crop, 24 access tubes were installed in the approximate geometric center of each plot with 12 tubes each in the rainfed and full levels (Fig. 1). Field calibration from a nearby site (3 km away) with the same soils was used for one of the probes (Bhatti et al., 2020). The second probe was cross-calibrated using the first probe for the field site.Remote sensing imageryRemote sensing data was acquired from the PlanetScope satellite multispectral imager (Planet Labs, Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA) with a spatial resolution of 3 m and temporal resolution of~1 day. The imagery was captured over the field between 10:30 and 11:30 AM. The data were only selected if the imagery over and around the field was free of clouds and image stripes. A total of 20 images (taken between May 8 and October 10) in 2020, and 27 images (taken between April 29 and October 18) in 2021 were used in SETMI. The model used the red and near-infrared bands of the multispectral imagery to compute the SAVI.Weather dataA weather station (AgSense, Valmont Industries, Inc., Huron, SD, USA) was installed in an open area located to the west of the field. The weather data included air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, solar radiation, and rainfall, which were collected at a frequency of 5 min. The suite of sensors included a cup anemometer, wind direction sensor, pyranometer, relative humidity sensor, air temperature sensor, and rain gauge (model Vantage Pro2 Plus, Davis Instruments, Hayward, CA). The cup anemometer was mounted at a height of about 3 m. The weather data was automatically retrieved by the ISSCADA system and was also accessible manually through the AgSense website. In addition, weather data was also acquired from Memphis 5N weather station (Automated Weather Data Network, High Plains Regional Climate Center), which was about 5 km from the field. Historic 20-yr weather data (2000–2019) was also accessed from this weather station to compute the normal reference ET.Crop yieldCrop yield was calculated using yield monitor data from the combine harvesters. The yield data was cleaned and processed using the Yield Editor software version 2.0 (USDA-Agricultural Research Service, Columbia, MO). The processed data was then checked using the mean yield reported from the weighing grain carts. The Yield Editor software was used to adjust the moisture of grains (measured using yield monitor) to 15.5% for maize and 13% for soybean. The dry yield was computed by removing the mass of moisture from the grains (dry yield=(100 – percent moisture in grain) * yield). Data points were only included if they were within a 6.1 m buffer from each plot boundary.Irrigation managementThe values of field capacity and wilting point used were 0.4 m3 m−3 and 0.2 m3 m−3, respectively. These values were computed by averaging field capacity and wilting point measurements from multiple locations in a nearby field (within 3 km; Bhatti et al., 2020). The irrigation depths prescribed in an irrigation event ranged between 5 and 25 mm. The different irrigation refill levels included rainfed, deficit, full, and over-applied at 0, 50, 100, and 150%, respectively of the amounts determined by each irrigation scheduling method for the full level. Hence, the 50 and 150% levels were computed by scaling the full irrigation amount by corresponding fractions. Since the center pivot was not capable of varying the irrigation rate of individual sprinklers on the pivot lateral, the sprinkler nozzles for the deficit and over levels were outfitted with the required sized nozzles to achieve variable rate application along the lateral of the pivot. These custom sized nozzles for the deficit and over levels were specified by the irrigation dealer for achieving the required application depth in the respective irrigation zones. The nozzles for the deficit level were switched to smaller sizes (to achieve 50% of the full), and the nozzles for the over level were changed to larger sizes (to achieve 150% of the full). The nozzles for the rainfed zone were set to the off position, so these nozzles applied no water throughout the season. The sprinkler nozzles automatically applied corresponding amounts of irrigation on the respective irrigation levels (0, 50, 100, and 150%). With these modifications to the sprinkler package from the default manufacturer’s design, system uniformity analysis was conducted using catch-can tests to ensure high application efficiency in the different management zones. Two catch-can tests were conducted on June 25, 2020, and June 10, 2021. The wind speed, air temperature, and time for the test were 4.5 m s−1, 30 °C, and 12:00 PM–1:00 PM, respectively, in 2020 and 2.6 m s−1, 31 °C, and 10:00–11:00 AM, respectively, in 2021. Average percent difference between measured (in cans) and prescribed irrigation depth was 28% in 2020 and 13% in 2021. The test in 2021 was conducted early in the morning with lower evaporative demand and lower wind speeds than 2020. The Christiansen uniformity coefficient (CU) was also determined for each irrigation level following Eisenhauer et al. (2021). The CU in the deficit level was 53% for 2020 and 71% for 2021. The CU for the over level was 82% for 2020 and 92% for 2021. The full level had a CU of above 90% in both tests. To account for boundary effects from neighboring management zones, a buffer of 6.1 m from each plot boundary was used. The plot area after excluding the buffer zone was used to prescribe irrigation. The input irrigation depth for each sector was determined using the four irrigation methods discussed below.ISSCADA plant feedback methodThe iCWSI data were calculated for each treatment plot. Canopy temperature data from dry scans were only used for iCWSI computations. It was found that the canopy temperature collected during irrigation events had an apparent canopy cooling of about 2 °C from irrigation water for this sprinkler configuration due to the wet canopy (Bhatti et al., 2022b). Therefore, the canopy temperature data collected during irrigation was not used for computing iCWSI. The iCWSI data for each plot designated as “plant feedback method with the full level” computed by the ISSCADA system from the most recent dry scan were compared with pre-established iCWSI thresholds that were used to determine the irrigation amount. The most recent dry scan IRT data was used to schedule irrigation in 2021. The replicate plots of this method in different sector blocks were managed independent of each other and had varying levels of irrigation prescribed in a single irrigation event. This method included three iCWSI thresholds: low (L), medium (M), and high (H) threshold. These thresholds are region, climate, and crop specific.For irrigation management in 2020, the iCWSI data for a dry scan were compared among the different irrigation levels to compute the prescribed irrigation depth. The minimum iCWSI values for the rainfed and deficit levels were used as the high threshold. The minimum iCWSI values from the full level plots were used as the low threshold. The average value of the high and low thresholds was used as the medium threshold. The most recent dry scan data were used to compute new thresholds for each irrigation event in 2020. The low, medium, and high thresholds used for 2020 ranged between 100 and 150, 130 and 170, and 150 and 190, respectively, for both crops. These thresholds were used to determine the amount of irrigation in 2020. The timing of the irrigation was decided based on soil water data from the Acclima TDR sensors similar to the hybrid method. The thresholds for irrigation management for the 2021 growing season were computed using the iCWSI data from the 2020 growing season (refer to Bhatti et al., 2022a for details). The low, medium, and high thresholds were 120, 150, and 180, respectively for maize and 110, 130, and 150, respectively for soybean. The irrigation was prescribed according to the mean iCWSI calculated for the designated treatment plots: no irrigation for iCWSI≤L, 13 mm for L<iCWSI≤M, 19 mm for M<iCWSI≤H, and 25 mm for iCWSI>H. It was observed that the mean iCWSI computed for rainfed was always higher as compared with deficit or full irrigation levels. Hence, it was more likely that the irrigation would be triggered using iCWSI thresholds for rainfed since the iCWSI values for rainfed were higher in comparison with the other levels (Bhatti et al., 2022a).ISSCADA hybrid methodThe ISSCADA hybrid method used the soil water data from TDR soil water sensors and iCWSI data collaboratively to prescribe irrigation. The depth weighted average of soil water content was used to represent root zone soil water content. The soil water depletion (SWD) was estimated from the field capacity, wilting point, and soil water content (O’Shaughnessy et al., 2020). The ratio of SWD to the maximum value of SWD (difference between field capacity and wilting point) was used to define SWD thresholds. The irrigation was managed with SWD and iCWSI thresholds: if SWD≤15% then no irrigation, if 15%<SWD≤35% then manage using only iCWSI thresholds as in plant feedback method, and if SWD>35% then apply 25 mm irrigation. The most recent dry scan iCWSI data and SWD values computed using TDR sensors from the hybrid-full treatment plots were used to manage irrigation for this method. The iCWSI data for each hybrid-full treatment plot were independently used to prescribe irrigation for the plot. However, one value of SWD was used for this method at a given time since there was one location of TDR sensors per crop.SETMI method using spatial evapotranspiration modelThe water balance approach of the spatial evapotranspiration model was used to prescribe irrigation for the SETMI method (Neale et al., 2012). This approach maintains ', 'unique_identifier': 190}\n",

The study aims to predict soil moisture and, as such, the need for irrigation, using nonlinear mathematical models, describing the relationship between RGB and HSL colour model components and soil moisture and temperature. Nonlinear mathematical models used in the study are based on piecewise linear regression with breakpoint and soil moisture prediction using colour components and soil temperature with a deviation of +-6%. A system for automated irrigation was created and its control program was made, the basic control law of which is based on non-linear piecewise linear models. The automated irrigation management system includes a remote crop monitoring subsystem and an irrigation management subsystem. The program processes the photo received from the camera and activates the actuators when watering is needed. Compared to manual data collection in the first part of the study, the program calculates the average RGB model values from images in the studied row of tomato plantations with an accuracy of over 99% for the R and G components and over 92% for the B component. The program also predicts soil moisture with 98% accuracy. The practical significance of the water-saving efforts of this study lies in the development of a program-controlled automated irrigation system that utilizes plants as biological sensors, employing nonlinear mathematical models based on leaf colour changes to accurately predict soil moistureKeywords:biosensors; precision irrigation; RGB colourimetry; image processing; digitalization; bioinformaticshttps://doi.org/10.48077/scihor1.2024.127Retrieved from Vol. 27, No. 1, 2024Pages 127-139Share146 Views READ ARTICLEREFERENCESSUGGESTED CITATIONReferences[1] Araújo-Paredes, C., Portela, F., Mendes, S., & Valín, M.I.

Hence improving water productivity is the primary purpose of sustainable agriculture. This study aimed to use cloud IoT solutions to control a modern subsurface irrigation system for improving irrigation management of date palms in arid regions. To achieve this goal, we designed, constructed, and validated the performance of a fully automated controlled subsurface irrigation system (CSIS) to monitor and control the irrigation water amount remotely. The CSIS is based on an autonomous sensors network to instantly collect the climatic parameters and volumetric soil water content in the study area. Therefore, we employed the ThingSpeak cloud platform to host sensor readings, perform algorithmic analysis, instant visualize the live data, create event-based alerts to the user, and send instructions to the IoT devices. The validation of the CSIS proved that automatically irrigating date palm trees controlled by the sensor-based irrigation scheduling (S-BIS) is more efficient than the time-based irrigation scheduling (T-BIS). The S-BIS provided the date palm with the optimum irrigation water amount at the opportune time directly in the functional root zone. Generally, the S-BIS and T-BIS of CSIS reduced the applied irrigation water amount by 64.1% and 61.2%, respectively, compared with traditional surface irrigation (TSI). The total annual amount of applied irrigation water for CSIS with S-BIS method, CSIS with T-BIS method, and TSI was 21.04, 22.76, and 58.71 m3 palm−1, respectively. The water productivity at the CSIS with S-BIS (1.783 kg m−3) and T-BIS (1.44 kg m−3) methods was significantly higher compared to the TSI (0.531 kg m−3). The CSIS with the S-BIS method kept the volumetric water content in the functional root zone next to the field capacity compared to the T-BIS method. The deigned CSIS with the S-BIS method characterized by the positive impact on the irrigation water management and enhancement on fruit yield of the date palm is quite proper for date palm irrigation in the arid regions.Keywords: Internet of Things; microcontroller; water productivity; sensor-based; subsurface irrigation scheduling; evapotranspiration; remote monitoring; micro-irrigation control1. IntroductionWater scarcity in arid and semi-arid regions is a primary constraint to sustainable cultivation [1]. However, ongoing population growth requires sustained growth of food production in the future, which in turn requires irrigation water inputs that can support irrigated cultivation. Even though the utilization of reclaimed water and desalinated seawater can facilitate agricultural irrigation, the safety risk of reclaimed water, the high-energy requirement, and the high cost of desalination water hinder this irrigation utilization [2,3,4]. Therefore, there is a need to use innovative irrigation technologies to ensure sufficient food production with optimum irrigation water amount [1,5,6].Date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) is dominant in the arid and semi-arid regions characterized by water resource scarcity [7,8,9]. Despite water scarcity in these regions, inefficient irrigation water use still prevails on the date palm orchards, which is indicated for the precious groundwater sources depletion [10]. The authors in [11] estimated the irrigation water requirements of date palm trees in different areas of Saudi Arabia. They mentioned that the amount of irrigation water required for the date palm per hectare (100 palms ha−1) ranged from 7299 to 9495 m3 ha−1, based on the proportion of the date palm cultivated area. Another study was carried in the western region of Saudi Arabia; they determined the amount of irrigation water of 7300 m3 ha−1 for the date palm (100 palms ha−1) [12]. There is an urgent worldwide need to change from traditional irrigation systems to on-demand irrigation methods for water conservation in these regions [13]. Although the highest yield of the date palm is obtained when providing complete irrigation water requirements by traditional surface irrigation methods, the exact yield can be achieved with significantly more limited irrigation water application by using modern irrigation systems [14]. Therefore, continuous efforts to design modern irrigation systems improve irrigation water management, crop yield, and reducing irrigation water inputs [1,6,15,16,17].Most currently applied irrigation systems are based on constant periodical water application regardless of the plant’s actual need for irrigation water, which is a big challenge [5]. Proper irrigation scheduling assists in producing good crop production. However, when surface irrigation systems are applied, it is not practical to change the irrigation water depth and frequency too much due to the difficulty of implementation. Variations in irrigation depth are very confusing for the producers to vary the irrigation schedule [18,19]. Determining the optimum amount of water is not an easy task; it depends on multiple factors such as air temperature, an average of relative humidity, wind speed, sun hours, and solar radiation [19,20]. Therefore, the irrigation depth is roughly estimated to keep the irrigation depth and the interval constant over the growing period [18]. The accurate determination of the irrigation schedule is a complicated and time-consuming process. Using computer programs has made it more accessible, and it is now possible to schedule the irrigation water amount precisely according to the water required for the crops [14,18,21]. Sensor-based irrigation scheduling is an efficient tool customized to field characteristics that can significantly facilitate irrigation scheduling decisions [4].Due to the enormous revolution of IoT and the development of sensors for intelligent agriculture, its applications introduce a significant positive impact on plants and irrigation water conservation [22]. The authors in [23] presented an IoT-based monitoring and control system for irrigation. They focused on the facilitation of supplying adequate water amount to some domestic crops in India. The authors used a pumping mechanism to apply the water needed by the soil. However, they did not use a flow meter to measure the amount of water applied. Also, in [23], the authors considered the surface irrigation system that wastes enormous water because of water evaporation.Moreover, the deep roots of the date palm have not benefited from all these wasted amounts of water in surface irrigation. In our CSIS, we automated the on-demand irrigation by using a subsurface irrigation system. Thus, we reached the optimum amount of water required by the date palm tree. Moreover, we eliminated the evaporation caused by surface irrigation. The authors in [21] introduced an IoT-based dynamic irrigation scheduling system used for efficient water management. The authors focused on automating the irrigation process instead of the manual irrigation treatment. They measured the water level that real-time presents in the field with a low-cost sensor. The introduced system collects the measures and introduces them to the farmer to decide on the manual irrigation method. There should exist some recommendations/suggestions because such a vast model must not depend on the farmers experience.Improved monitoring for the measures affecting the irrigation system for mustard leaf is introduced in [24]. The authors employed an IoT monitoring system using ESPresso Lite V2.0 module that connected with a VH400 sensor, a flow meter, and a weather station. The introduced framework in [16] is for monitoring only; no actions are taken based on the monitored data. Another study [25] controlled the volume and frequency of irrigation water based on an irrigation water management system and some low-cost sensors for measuring the soil moisture level. The authors in [25] used a FC-28 soil moisture sensor. Machine learning is also used with IoT for automating farming. The authors in [26] introduced automation for the irrigation system used by farmers to increase the yield and quality. The authors constructed a wireless sensor network in each region on the farm. Machine learning is used to predict irrigation patterns depending on the crops and some weather scenarios. On the other hand, the authors have clarified neither the employed machine learning algorithms nor the technical structure of the wireless sensor network.Precision agriculture has also employed deep learning neural networks with IoT for intelligent irrigation systems [6]. It is considered a feedback system that works better based on the weather of any region. In this system, the water deficit is observed by farmers experience based on the leaf color of the plant and the growth of branches. This must be done using machine vision to avoid errors caused by human observations.Subsurface irrigation systems are considered the most effective way to conserve irrigation water. The irrigation water does not evaporate from the soil surface using subsurface irrigation systems compared to traditional surface irrigation methods. The subsurface irrigation systems are characterized by water application at low intensity directly in the functional root zone of the date palm [1,16,27,28,29]. The automatic irrigation system, including wireless soil moisture sensors, obtains more yield with less irrigation water requirement, and the water productivity is improved [5,17,25]. The efficient irrigation systems considerably help increase the water-productivity of crops, especially in regions with water deficits and a lack of automated irrigation facilities [30,31].Due to the importance of water and its scarcity in arid regions, it is imperative to employ modern technologies and intelligent systems for improving water productivity and conservation. Although subsurface irrigation systems can save irrigation water, these systems must be developed to avoiding the disadvantages of traditional surface and subsurface irrigation methods. In the traditional subsurface irrigation systems, it is necessary to have one of the workers constantly in the field for follow-up the irrigation processes, this is very cumbersome for farmers in practice. Moreover, the applied water amount is usually imprecision due to those the subsurface irrigation systems are largely unseen. There is also a need to overcome the possibility that the wetting pattern may be too small in the soil due to irrigation system breakdown or insufficient irrigation water necessary. Thus, we should emphasize using smart subsurface irrigation systems. Moreover, employing the promising capabilities for the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud platforms to control subsurface irrigation systems. To improve water productivity and conservation, avoid the problems of the traditional subsurface irrigation systems, and enhance the yield of date palm in the arid region. This is behind our motivation to design, construct, and validate the fully automated subsurface irrigation system to control the water amount needed for irrigating date palm trees in the arid regions.The main goal of this study is to implement a fully automated subsurface irrigation system with sensor-based/time-based irrigation scheduling methods for irrigation water conservation in arid regions. To achieve this goal, we divided it into four sub-objectives:Design and construct a modern subsurface irrigation system for date palm irrigation.Design and install an autonomous sensors’ network to instantly collect the volumetric moisture content for sensor-based irrigation scheduling and climatic parameters for time-based irrigation scheduling.Employ the ThingSpeak cloud platform to host our data, perform algorithmic analysis, create event-based alerts to the user, create event-based alerts to the user, and send instructions to the IoT devices of the applied irrigation scheduling method.Study the impact of the controlled subsurface irrigation system on irrigation water consumption, water productivity, and yield of date palm compared with applied traditional surface irrigation system in the experimental area.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Experimental SiteThe controlled subsurface irrigation system (CSIS) was designed and constructed at the Date Palm Research Center of Excellence (DPRC, King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia). The experiment was conducted in an arid region at the DPRC farms (Latitude: 25.261° N, Longitude: 49.708° E) for one year from 1 January to 31 December 2020. The electrical conductivity (ECw), pH, and total dissolved solids (TDS) of the used irrigation water in the experiment were 0.93 ± 0.11 dS m−1, 7.8 ± 0.8, and 685 ± 58.5 mg L−1. Table 1 shows the physical and hydraulic properties of the sandy loam soil in the experimental site.Table 1. Physical and hydraulic properties of the sandy loam soil in the experimental site.2.2. Description of the Controlled Subsurface Irrigation SystemThe controlled Subsurface Irrigation System (CSIS) consisted of the subsurface irrigation system with its mechanical and electrical parts and the remote monitoring and controlling system with its electronic hardware and software components. Figure 1 shows the main components of the CSIS, and below is the description of these main components of the CSIS:Figure 1. Schematic diagram of the essential components of the designed subsurface irrigation system (SIS).

Design of Subsurface Irrigation SystemThe subsurface irrigation system SIS was composed of a water resource, water pump set, irrigation network, power source, and control unit subsurface irrigation units (SIU). Details of the essential components of the CSIS are as follows:Water source and pump set: The source of water used for the experiment was from a groundwater well at the site of the experiment. The water is pumped from the well to the water tank using a 2 kW water pump. The water tank was made of polyethylene and had a volume of 5 m3. Another water pump (1 kW) was used to supply the designed irrigation network with sufficient irrigation water at the required pressure.Irrigation network: The irrigation network included the mainline, sub mains, and feeder ring pipe made of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) with diameters of 0.05 m, 0.03 m, and 0.025 m. The irrigation network also the disc filters (120 mesh, 130 microns), manual valves, solenoid valves, among other irrigation accessories.Power source and control unit: The power source of the control unit that included the electronic devices and power source of sensors were taken from a battery (12 V, 55 Ah). A 50 W solar panel charges this battery with a charging regulator.Subsurface irrigation unit (SIU): The SIU consisted of two perforated pipes made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) wrapped with a filtering cloth to prevent the transfer of fine soil inside the unit, as shown in Figure 2.Figure 2. Schematic diagram of the designed subsurface irrigation unit used in the controlled subsurface irrigation system (dimensions in m).

The slot width and length were 0.002 m and 0.004 m. The length of the inner pipe was 0.33 mm with a diameter of 0.025 m. The inner pipe was perforated in a spiral shape with a hole diameter of 0.03 m. Light volcanic gravel with a size of 0.004–0.008 m was placed between the two pipes to reduce the amount of water inside the unit, allowing all the nutrients to seep through. The flow rate of the SIU was adjusted using a low-pressure adjustable irrigation dripper (0–0.070 m3 h−1) at 0.030 m3 h−1 by twisting the dripper head at the irrigation network pressure of 250 k Pa. Six SIU were buried around each date palm tree at a circle of 1.30 m, as shown in Figure 3. The six SIUs were attached with the ring distribution pipe; the ring pipe was connected to the sub mainline above ground.Figure 3.

IoT System ArchitectureThe main goal of the designed CSIS cloud IoT solution is water management of date palm by efficiently controlling the subsurface irrigation system through employing the marvelous capabilities of cloud computing and the IoT. Implicitly, the designed CSIS can monitor various parameters and automatically notify the user in case of emergency by either sending an email message or a short message. It controls the subsurface irrigation system for date palm to apply the optimum amount of water needed by the date palm tree. It can be considered as a sensor-based subsurface irrigation scheduling (S-BIS). It schedules the water amount to be applied for the date palm on variable periods based on the measures received from the sensors. The system gets the measurements from the sensors, uploads these measures to the ThingSpeak cloud platform, does cloud analysis, makes decisions, and applies decisions to the subsurface irrigation system. Our CSIS is shown in Figure 4. The designed system makes irrigation decisions based on direct measurement of volumetric water content (VWC), while monitoring other factors such as air temperature, relative humidity (RH), solar radiation, wind speed, and water flow rate per minute.Figure 4. The designed controlled subsurface irrigation system (CSIS) was deployed around a date palm tree in our experimental field.The figure shows the detailed workflow for our designed CSIS. It has five main components:Experimental field: we conducted our experiments (for the CSIS cloud IoT solution) over nine-date palm trees divided into three replications (R1, R2, and R3). The sensors of the designed system are deployed around the center palm tree for each replicate.Electrical and electronic devices: we employed the following electrical and electronic devices for each replicate in our experimental field—the NodeMCU (ESP8266 Shenzhen Quine Trading Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China) as a microcontroller unit. We used a water pump, a solenoid valve, an anemometer, and a flow meter.Internet in the study area: to provide the Internet in the study area, we used a data SIM card of a local communications network and a 4G Router (HUAWEI, Hunan JENET Technology Co., Ltd. Changsha, China. As soon as the SIM card is plugged in HUAWEI 4G router and turn it on, the NodeMCUs instantly have Wi-Fi access. Then the NodeMCUs immediately connect to the Internet. The router was plugged all-time with a 5 V power source using an inverter (12 V to 5 V, 2.1 A) connected with the battery of our system. No problems with internet connection were observed in the study area during the trial period. The used router can connect up to 32 wireless devices, providing a fast and stable connection for all used NodeMCUs.A set of sensors: we employed three VH400 sensors (Vegetronix, Inc., Riverton, Salt Lake County, UT, USA) for each replicate. It is used to measure the VWC. Each of these VH400 sensors is installed between two subsurface irrigation (SIS) units at 0.8 m from the date palm tree trunk and 0.3 m depth. We used two DHT11 sensors for measuring relative humidity percentage and air temperature in the study area. Also, we measured the solar radiation by installing two solar cells under the shadow of the center date palm tree.ThingSpeak cloud platform: we upload the measurements collected from the set of sensors by using the ESP8266 module to our private channel on the ThingSpeak cloud platform. We employed MATLAB Analysis, TalkBack App, and React App (Mathematical computing software, Natick, MA, USA) to make decisions through the cloud platform.Monitoring interface: the user uses this to monitor the graphical data generated by our private channel on the ThingSpeak cloud platform.Our CSIS is initialized by connecting the ESP8266 module to the Internet, setting up the smart connected sensors, and launching our private channel on the ThingSpeak cloud platform. Each corresponding sensor sends its real-time measures to the ESP8266 module, which uploads the collected measurements to our private channel on the ThingSpeak cloud platform.The efficiently controlled water management process is achieved in our designed CSIS by a comprehensive analysis of the uploaded measurements on our private channel. At first, the MATLAB Analysis App runs an introduced algorithm to calculate new data based on the current data in the fields of our private channel. Based on the analysis above, some instructions, commands, or messages will be sent back to the ESP8266 module or the user using Talkback App or React App, respectively. Then, the ESP8266 module directly forwards the command/s to the designated connected sensor or device to execute the given instructions:(1)Hardware layoutThe design phase for the expected hardware devices is crucial when connecting multiple electronic hardware devices. We started with the idea of constructing an IoT system for subsurface irrigation. We used KiCad version 5.1.2-1 (KiCad is a free software suite, KiCad Services Co., Davis, CA, USA) on a MacBook Pro (3.3 GHz Intel Core i7) to draw our expected schematic and confirm the electrical rules check, as shown in Figure 5. KiCad is a perfect open-source software to create electronic schematic diagrams. KiCad has various stand-alone software tools such as, KiCad project manager, Eeschema (which has been used in this paper), Pcbnew, GrebView, Bitmap2Component, PCB Calculator, and P1 Editor. From our humble perspective, KiCad is mature enough to develop and maintain vast and complex electronic boards. This was behind our motivation to use KiCad for designing our expected schematic design.Figure 5. The detailed schematic KiCad diagram with successful electrical rules check.Figure 5 represents the detailed schematic KiCad diagram for our system model after running electrical rules check for it. This figure consists of two main parts, the description and the connected electronic devices and sensors. The description part consists of:A set of comments related to the connected devices and sensors:○Comment 1: The Vpulse generator is used as an anemometer to measure air velocity.○Comment 2: The Vpulse generator is used as a flow meter to measure the water amount per minute.○Comment 3: The solar radiation is measured by using two separate solar cells.○Comment 4: The Volumetric Water Content (VWC) is measured by using three VH400 sensors. The average reading of the three sensors is considered.ESP8266 NodeMCU board: In our system, we used one ESP8266 NodeMCU board. It is an open-source firmware and development board. We considered using ESP8266 module for its efficacy and simplicity for monitoring and controlling things anywhere in the world. It has 128 KB RAM and 4 MB of Flash memory for data and program storage. The ESP8266 NodeMCU is equipped with 30 pins for interfacing it with the outside world. We used 21 pins to connect all the considered electronic devices and sensors with the ESP8266 NodeMCU board. The used pins are eight power pins (3.3V and GND), 12 multiplexed GPIO pins, and one analog pin. Thus, we still have ten unused pins to do further scaling and improvements for our system in the future using the same board.VH400 Volumetric Water Content (VWC) Sensor: We used three VH400 VWC sensors. They are connected to A0, GPIO9, and GPIO10. They are connected to A0 through 74LS151 monolithic data multiplexer. VH400 is used primarily to stop over-watering caused by the traditional watering systems. This sensor introduces precise readings and effective soil moisture content monitoring. Once VH400 is inserted into the soil, it can accurately read in approximately 400 ms (rapid response time). Thus, it can be installed at different depths from the surface. Moreover, it consumes less than 13 mA (low power consumption rate). It is suitable for long-term use. It can be easily interfaced with any system. It can operate from −40 °C to 85 °C.DHT11 Digital Temperature & Humidity Sensor: We used two DHT11 sensors. They are connected to GPIO2 and GPIO12. The DHT11 sensor considers the exclusive digital signal acquisition method for sensing humidity and temperature. It is equipped with a high-performance 8-bit microcontroller. It supports long-term stability and high reliability. The accuracy of the DHT11 sensor is ±5% RH and ±2 °C while operating between 20% RH to 90% RH and 0 °C to 50 °C. The features mentioned above are behind our motivation to use such an accurate and efficient sensor for measuring relative humidity and temperature in our water conservation system.Flow Meter: We used a flow meter sensor to measure the water flow. It is connected to GPIO4. To calculate the flow rate in L min−1, we used a pulse counter to count the number of pulses of the flow meter sensor in exactly one-second intervals. We calculated the number of milliseconds that have passed since the last execution. Then we used the measured number of milliseconds to scale the output. Also, we applied the calibration factor to scale the outcome based on the number of pulses per second per unit of measure (L min−1) coming from the sensor. The flow rate is calculated using:Fr=Fc×Pn(1)where Fr is the flow rate (m3 h−1), Fc is the calibration factor, Pn is pulse number per min.Anemometer: This device measures the wind speed and direction. We used a three cups anemometer. It is an aluminum alloyed 4–20 mA current output wind speed sensor. It gives a pulse signal output. The start-up wind speed is 4 to 8 km h−1. It is connected to the ESP8266 through GPIO14.Solar Cells: We used two single solar cells to measure the solar radiation in the field of the experiment. They are connected to the ESP8266 module through GPIO0 and GPIO13.74LS151 Analog Multiplexer: We used one monolithic data multiplexer. It contains full on-chip binary decoding to select the desired data source. It can choose one-of-eight data sources. It has a strobe input which must be at a low logic level to enable these devices.G5Q-1A Electrical Relay: We used two G5Q-1A electrical relays. They are connected to GPIO16. This kind of relay is a single-pole relay. It can switch performance for different loads ideally. The first relay in our model is used to connect the AC motor. The second relay is used to connect the solenoid valve.RC1602A-GHW-ESX LCD: We used one LCD in our system. It is mainly used to display some information related to doing an action at the current time. It is connected to the ESP8266 module through GPIO1, GPIO3, and GPIO5.(2)Software layoutWe applied the system life cycle to build a successful software by accomplishing the essential requirements for software engineering:Requirements: We explicitly defined the measures required for the subsurface irrigation system (VWC, soil temperature, RH, and temperature). Also, the expected output from our software is identified.Analysis: The main code is running on the ESP8266 module is divided into multiple functions; each function is responsible for a specific task. As shown in Figure 6, we mainly have five functions:○IntializeSensor( )○ReadData( )○Write2ThingSpeak( )○SerialMonitor( )○Print2LCD( )Figure 6. The repeatedly executed code on the ESP8266 NodeMCU board.Design: The data variables/objects and operations have been identified.Refinement and Coding: the required algorithms and data variables/objects have been implemented.Verification: We introduced the verification for our software by comparing the actions taken by our system and another system for collecting the measures manually.The detailed description for our functions is as follows:IntializeSensor( ): It touches the sensors considered in our designed system for resets, calibrations, and manual readings. It should be mentioned that each sensor has a unique name that passed as an argument to the IntializeSensor( ) function to execute some tasks on that sensor. Also, a getInstruction( ) function is started to collect the user’s instructions for a specific sensor for adjustment purposes.ReadData( ): once the reading time is reached, the ReadData( ) function collects the requested measures from all the sensors in our designed system. This is based on the internal library of each sensor.Write2ThingSpeak( ): it is used to write multiple fields simultaneously to our private channel on the ThingSpeak cloud platform. The designed system does real-time measures based on the small-time interval considered to read the data from the sensors. It should be mentioned that writing the actions to ThingSpeak is done every 10 min. Thus, the average for the measured data during the last 10 min will be written to its designated field to our private channel on ThingSpeak.SerialMonitor( ): It sends the real measured values from each sensor to the serial monitor at the occurrence of each read interval.Print2LCD( ): It is responsible for sending the commands that are currently running to the LCD.2.3. Sensors CalibrationThe volumetric water content sensor calibration was conducted directly using the soil with different water content in the actual study area. The sensor probe was wholly entered vertically into the soil; then, the readings were recorded. After the sensor was read, the soil sample around the sensor with a diameter of 20 cm and a depth of 20 cm was carefully transported to the laboratory to estimate the actual volumetric water content of the soil samples. The actual volumetric water content was determined based on the gravimetric method by multiplying the gravimetric water content by the soil bulk density, divided by the water density. The amount of water content was determined using a drying oven (LVO-2041P vacuum-drying oven, Dai Han Scientific Co., Ltd., Inchon, Korea) at 105 °C for 48 h.

Key issues in this regard include how to deal with spatial variability and the adoption of deficit irrigation strategies at the field scale. A software application originally designed for water balance-based automated irrigation scheduling locally fine-tuned through the use of sensors has been further developed with the emerging paradigm of both digital twins and the Internet of Things (IoT). The aim of this research is to demonstrate the feasibility of automatically scheduling the irrigation of a commercial vineyard when adopting regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) strategies and assimilating in near real time the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) obtained from Sentinel-2 imagery. In addition, simulations of crop evapotranspiration obtained by the digital twin were compared with remote sensing estimates using surface energy balance models and Copernicus-based inputs. Results showed that regression between instantaneous fAPAR and in situ measurements of the fraction of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (fIPAR) had a coefficient of determination (R2) ranging from 0.61 to 0.91, and a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.10. The conversion of fAPAR to a daily time step was dependent on row orientation. A site-specific automated irrigation scheduling was successfully adopted and an adaptive response allowed spontaneous adjustments in order to stress vines to a certain level at specific growing stages. Simulations of the soil water balance components performed well. The regression between digital twin simulations and remote sensing-estimated actual (two-source energy balance Priestley–Taylor modeling approach, TSEB-PTS2+S3) and potential (Penman–Monteith approach) evapotranspiration showed RMSD values of 0.98 mm/day and 1.14 mm/day, respectively.Keywords: precision irrigation; digital twin; fAPAR; Sentinel; evapotranspiration1. IntroductionPresently, water is becoming scarce not only in arid and drought areas, but also in regions where rainfall used to be abundant. Although approximately 70% of freshwater resources is used for food production, less than 60% of all water used for irrigation is effectively used by crops [1]. One way to address this issue is to reduce inefficiencies in irrigation management. This requires modernization of irrigation, from river catchment to precise delivery and scheduling at the field level. Although it is true that there is a lot of scientific and technical knowledge about the best irrigation strategies to be adopted for each crop and time at the field level, putting them into practice is not a simple task. The main limitations are the availability of the tools and skills required that allow the quantification and monitoring of crop water requirements and water status in order to provide the right amount of water at the right time and place. In this context, precision irrigation, which is the application of the concept of precision agriculture to the field of irrigation, can contribute to the technological approach. Precision agriculture has been recently defined as “a management strategy that gathers, processes and analyses temporal, spatial and individual data and combines it with other information to support management decisions according to estimated variability for improved resource use efficiency, productivity, quality, profitability and sustainability of agricultural production” [2]. The latest technological developments in precision irrigation offer important opportunities to close the existing gap between water productivity and the profitability of an agricultural plot.Crop water requirements are usually calculated following the FAO-56 soil water balance (SWB) approach [3]. This approach is based on estimating maximum crop evapotranspiration (ETc), obtained by multiplying a reference evapotranspiration (ET0), calculated through the Penman–Monteith method, by a crop coefficient (Kc) that is characteristic for each crop and growth stage. However, particularly in woody crops, this approach can be quite uncertain as Kc may vary depending on factors such as row spacing and orientation, variety, crop load and canopy training system [4,5]. With respect to the latter of these factors, some studies have refined Kc in discontinuous canopies with indirect measurements of light interception [6,7,8]. Additionally, supplying the full water requirements is not always possible or desirable. For instance, regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) strategies have been successfully adopted to achieve higher water productivities [9,10,11] and/or fruit quality [12,13,14]. Crop water status can be monitored with sensors and used for irrigation scheduling [15,16,17]. Among the different sensors that are available, soil moisture capacitance sensors are probably the most widely used to trigger irrigation [18,19]. Although the simplest methodology is based on the switching on or off of valves when the signal of a soil moisture probe crosses some predefined threshold, commonly soil water content at field capacity and wilting point [20], particular consideration needs to be given to the high sensitivity of these sensors to differences in soil hydraulic properties and the heterogeneous distribution of soil water content, especially in drip irrigation systems. A combination of SWB and soil water content monitoring methods seems the best way to efficiently schedule irrigation [21]. This type of dual approaches are based on determining irrigation doses from a SWB model and feedback from sensors for the site-specific empirical adjustment of Kc [22,23]. The methodology proposed by Casadesús et al. [22] uses the trend of minimum soil moisture values between consecutive days to fine tune the water balance. IRRIX was a decision support system (DSS) designed for SWB-based automated irrigation scheduling locally tuned by sensors. Its feasibility was demonstrated in various crops such as Japanese plum [24], apple [23] or olive trees [21]. This manuscript introduces further improvements of IRRIX, described in Section 2.3, in which the assimilation of sensor data by a SWB model has been further developed with the emerging paradigms of digital twins and the Internet of Things (IoT). A digital twin is a virtual representation that serves as the real-time digital counterpart of a physical object or process [25]. The new automated irrigation system introduced in this study computes crop water requirements and closes the irrigation control loop autonomously, on a daily basis, importing data from soil/plant sensors, meteorology and remote sensing. Irrigation prescriptions are automatically sent to the irrigation controller installed in the field compliant with site-specific strategies. The digital twin behind the automated irrigation system also allows to simulate the different SWB components separately, so the end user can see in real time the amount of water used or the crop water status.One of the main limitations of only using soil and/or plant sensors to trigger irrigation is that this will be based on point measurements which sometimes are not representative of the heterogeneity of the entire irrigation sector. Satellite-based remote sensing technologies open up the possibility of providing spatio-temporal information of fields in near real time. In particular, the recent launch of the open access Sentinel-2 satellites (S2) makes it possible to monitor vegetative growth on a five-day turnaround, as long as there are no clouds [26]. Typically, remote sensing spectral vegetation indices, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), have been used to derive Kc values [27,28,29]. However, saturation issues of some of these indices at moderate-to-dense canopy levels and limitations of crops with clumped canopy structures have been widely reported [30,31]. Instead, estimations of biophysical parameters of the vegetation could be more effective for the monitoring of vegetative growth and therefore the estimation of potential evapotranspiration. In this regard, the remote sensing-derived fraction of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (fIPAR) or the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) have been estimated in different crops, mostly using empirical relationships with spectral vegetation indices [32,33,34,35]. However, this approach is site specific and sensitive to the canopy architecture, the row orientation, the optical properties of the canopy elements and the background [36]. Very few studies have aimed to derive fIPAR in heterogeneous canopies, such as row-structured canopies, using radiative transfer models [18,37,38]. The fAPAR can also be derived from the biophysical processor available in the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP), which built a neuronal network with the PROSAIL model and applied it to all S2 reflective bands [39]. fAPAR is often approximated by fIPAR because the vegetation pigments present a strong absorption in this spectral domain and the background reflectivities are usually small for well-developed canopies [40,41]. Therefore, S2 fAPAR time series could be a good alternative for assimilation into digital twins and to estimate potential evapotranspiration in all types of canopy structures.It is well known that other approaches have also been developed to directly retrieve crop water requirements based on remotely sensed surface energy balance (SEB) models [42,43,44]. Land surface temperature (LST) plays a critical role in the SEB. However, a trade-off exists between the spatial and temporal resolution of current thermal infrared sensors onboard satellites. While waiting for the launch of new satellites with sensors with a high spatial-temporal resolution in the thermal infrared domain, several approaches have been tested to downscale the coarse resolution of thermal infrared satellite imagery [45,46,47,48]. For instance, some studies have successfully downscaled LST to 20 m using a data mining sharpening (DMS) approach [48] with S2 and Sentinel-3 (S3) images [49]. The obtained LST, together with other Copernicus-based inputs, was used to estimate daily actual evapotranspiration (ETa) through the Priestley–Taylor version of the two-source energy balance (TSEB-PT) model [50,51,52,53]. These studies reported accuracies of instantaneous latent heat flux in woody crops ranging from 76 to 87 W/m2. It is probable that in the near future SEB modelling approaches with high-resolution LST will be operationally used to map crop water status in near real time and assimilated into digital twins such as the one proposed in this study. Therefore, studies that validate these approaches in different types of crops and water status are necessary to advance the state of the art and evaluate their pros and cons.One of the main challenges of automated irrigation DSS is to implement them in commercial fields. From our knowledge, no study has used a DSS to automatically schedule irrigation of a commercial vineyard through assimilating in near real time remote sensing estimates of fAPAR. Nor has it been used in commercial fields with the adoption of RDI strategies. Nor have digital twin-obtained SWB simulations been validated or compared against other methodologies. Therefore, the aim of this research is to demonstrate the feasibility of automatically scheduling the irrigation of a commercial vineyard by assimilating S2 fAPAR and adopting an RDI strategy. In particular, this study focuses on: (i) regressing S2 fAPAR with instantaneous fIPAR and upscaling it on a daily time scale using Oyarzun’s modelling approach [54] in rows with different orientations, (ii) the suitability of adopting an RDI strategy through an automated irrigation DSS, and (iii) a comparison of the evapotranspiration simulations obtained from a digital twin with those estimated with the TSEB-PTS2+S3 and Penman–Monteith (PM) models using Copernicus-based inputs.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Study SiteThis study was carried out during the growing seasons 2020 and 2021 in a 6.9 ha commercial vineyard (cv. Grenache) located in Aranyó (41°30′18″ N–0°50′09″ E, 316 m, Lleida, Spain) (Figure 1). The vineyard comprised three different irrigation sectors of 2.0, 2.3 and 2.6 ha (Figure 1b). Vines were planted in 2018 with a 110 Rister rootstock and at 1.0 × 2.0 m spacing distance. Two irrigation sectors (A and B) were oriented at 140 ° (NW-SE), while irrigation sector C was oriented at 100 ° (close to E-W). The canopy system was trained using vertical shoot positioning (VSP), with a bilateral, spur-pruner cordon located 0.7 m above the ground. Soil was left bare throughout the growing season. Irrigation was provided by means of a single pipe with drippers every 1 m, whose nominal flow was 2 L/h. Disease control and nutrition vine management were conducted by Family Torres winery following the organic wine grape production protocol of the ‘Costers del Segre’ Denomination of Origin (Catalonia, Spain). The area has a typical Mediterranean climate, with dry and hot summers and mild winters. Total annual rainfall in 2020 and 2021 was 475 and 288 mm, respectively. The annual reference evapotranspiration (ET0) for each year was 1071 and 1065 mm, respectively.Figure 1. Study site of the vineyard, showing in (a) a general overview of the location, in (b) the vineyard with the three irrigation sectors (A, B and C), in (c) averaged seasonal Sentinel-2 fAPAR of 2019 and in (d) a zonification map based on averaged 2019 fAPAR and location of representative points for sensor installation. WSC corresponds to the zone within irrigation sector C subjected to water stress cycles.In addition, an area of 0.2 ha within irrigation sector C was used to evaluate the soil water balance simulations obtained by the digital twin and to compare the simulated evapotranspiration and stem water potential with, respectively, the remote sensing estimations of evapotranspiration and stem water potential measurements (Figure 1b). In this area, water stress cycles (WSC) were conducted throughout both studied growing seasons. This area contained two pure pixels of 20 m. The WSC consisted of cutting irrigation for short periods of time, twice per campaign, until measured stem water potential (Ψstem) reached values below −1.2 MPa and then recovering vine water status again.During 2020, irrigation scheduling was conducted by the winegrower without using the cloud-based irrigation decision support system described in Section 2.3. In that year, data were only gathered and used for simulations and validations. During 2021, irrigation scheduling was carried out through the automated irrigation DSS. The DSS assimilated in near real time information of remotely sensed estimates of daily fiPAR and data from soil moisture sensors and weather stations in order to calculate vine water requirements.2.2. Selection of the Location for Installing SensorsSentinel-2 fAPAR time series were analyzed during the 2019 growing season [39]. A more detailed explanation of the approach used to estimate fAPAR with Sentinel-2 is explained later in the manuscript (Section 2.5). The averaged seasonal fAPAR of 2019 was used to classify different management zones within the vineyard based on vegetative growth (Figure 1c). Three different zones corresponding to different canopy vigor levels (Low, Medium and High) were identified using the k-means clustering tool (QGIS software, version Hannover 3.16) (Figure 1d). In each irrigation sector, a representative measuring point was selected taking into account the fAPAR classification map. The point was placed in the zone with the highest percentage within each irrigation sector. This representative point within each irrigation sector was visually selected to install the soil moisture sensors at different positions. For each point, soil properties were also analyzed and soil moisture release curves obtained by Hyprop 2 (METER Group, Pullman, WA, USA) (Table 1).Table 1. Soil properties sampled in the vineyard.Three soil moisture sensors (TEROS-10, METER Group, Pullman, WA, USA) were installed in each representative point at 0.3 m depth at three different positions: below the emitter, and at 0.25 m and 0.5 m from the emitter. An MTKD water meter (LabFerrer S.L., Cervera, Lleida, Spain) was also installed in each point to measure the amount of water applied and to monitor irrigation events. All sensors were connected to a ZL6 datalogger (METER Group, Pullman, WA, USA) via cables, and the data stored at a 15-min frequency at the ZENTRA cloud platform in near real time. Meteorological data were automatically gathered from the website of the Meteorological Service of Catalonia (SMC, www.ruralcat.net/web/guest/agrometeo.estacions) corresponding to a weather station (Les Borges Blanques) located 1.5 km from the vineyard.2.3. IrriDesk® and Definition of the Irrigation Seasonal PlanThe automated irrigation decision support system (DSS) used in this study, so called IrriDesk®, is open-access accessible for research purposes through a non-commercial version and also commercially available to any grower through an external company. IrriDesk® (www.irridesk.com) is a cloud-hosted platform developed under the paradigm of digital twin, which on a daily basis, sends updated prescriptions to irrigation controllers, following the integration of different data sources such as local sensors, meteorological and remote sensing data. IrriDesk® is an evolution of IRRIX, which has previously been used in several trials of sensor-based irrigation control [21,23,24]. In both cases, the underlying approach for irrigation scheduling is a site-specific soil water balance (SWB) fine-tuned by sensors [22]. In this approach, irrigation prescriptions for each management zone are calculated once a day, based on an SWB model, in mm/day, and are sent machine-to-machine to the irrigation controller after conversion to minutes of irrigation per irrigation event, considering the properties of the irrigation system and the programmed irrigation frequency.A relevant feature of IrriDesk® is that irrigation scheduling is guided by a seasonal plan, which allows the application of more elaborate strategies, such as supplemental irrigation and RDI for managing irrigation with limiting water allocations. The seasonal plan specifies, for each day, a range of acceptable accumulated irrigation since the start of the season until that day. Then, if the measured irrigation approaches the borders of that range (maximum and minimum), the irrigation prescriptions do not respond to sensors but are calculated to keep the accumulated irrigation within the range. The target soil moisture is also specified in the seasonal plan and can be set at different values along the season. Additionally, intended water unbalances can be specified at precise periods of the season in terms of the ratio between the irrigation to prescribe and the irrigation resulting from the SWB model.In the trials reported in this study, the seasonal plan was elaborated through SWB simulations, using as inputs the agronomical description of the crop, soil and irrigation setup, the historical weather at the site in the previous 10 years, the range of annual irrigation applied in previous years and the curve of intended water unbalance agreed between researchers and farmer. In the studied vineyard, the upper and lower applied water thresholds were, respectively, set at 150 and 230 mm (Figure 2c). Since the aim was to adopt an RDI strategy, water status levels were defined as a multiplier of irrigation needs or intended water deviations from the SWB (Figure 2a). For instance, in this study the multiplier was set to 0.6 during pre-veraison because the winegrower wanted to stress vines at this phenological stage. Immediately before veraison, the multiplier was set to 1.5 in order to recover vine water status. During post-veraison, it progressively decreased from 1.0 to 0.7. During post-harvest, water status was recovered again by defining a threshold of 1.0. Based on these values, the relative soil water content upper and lower limits were also adjusted throughout the growing season (Figure 2b). All these curves were predefined to determine admissible bounds for the irrigation scheduling and to ensure that irrigation inputs above those available for the campaign were not used.Figure 2. Definition of the seasonal plan parameters configured in the irrigation decision support system (DSS). The plan specifies: (a) intentional soil water balance deviation, multiplier of water needs; (b) thresholds defining the range of crop water comfort in terms of relative soil water content recorded by sensors (wilting point = 0, field capacity = 1); (c) range of cumulative irrigation thresholds, mm.At the beginning of the growing season, the DSS considered an expected seasonal curve of daily fIPARd based on the values measured the previous year. As the season progressed, new observed values were obtained from remote sensing. The new values of estimated fIPARd at the observation day were assimilated as the weighted average between observed and expected values, where the weights were set at 0.9 and 0.1, respectively. The expected values for the remaining part of the season were also modified. In general, the expected fIPARd values were re-scaled to fit the new value with the expected value. However, in early and late stages of the growing season, when fIPARd was expected to undergo rapid variations with either shooting or leaf fall, the time axis was modified to fit the new with the expected value.With the configuration set in these trials, the daily irrigation dose (did) (mm/day) were calculated as:did=  iwu∗ET0∗  fKx∗fIPARd+Ke  −effRain+SPcorrection(1)where iwu is the intended water unbalance specified in the seasonal plan, ET0 is the reference evapotranspiration measured the previous day at a nearby weather station (mm/day), fKx is an empirically adjusted coefficient from feedback by soil moisture sensors [22], fIPARd is the expected fIPARd for that day (%), obtained from S2 fAPAR and upscaled on a daily time step with Oyarzun’s model, Ke is the coefficient for soil evaporation [3] calculated by the model, effRain is the effective rain of the previous day (mm), obtained from pluviometer measurements and recalculated by the model, and SPcorrection is the required addition or subtraction of irrigation to keep the measurements within the range specified in the seasonal plan.In addition to scheduling irrigation, the digital twin behind IrriDesk® models the different variables of the soil water balance. The SWB model is based on the rationale of AquaCrop [55] plus specific adaptations to deal with discontinuous canopies and drip irrigation. For instance, it deals with daily fIPAR and soil water content is obtained by individually simulating nine compartments spatially distributed throughout the tree spacing (three blocks with three soil profile layers in depth). The simulated SWB variables were used to calculate the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) as one minus the ratio between actual and potential transpiration rate (1 − Ta/Tp) [56].2.4. Field MeasurementsΨstem was measured in each representative point throughout the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons every two weeks at noon with a pressure chamber (model 3005; Soil Moisture Equipment Corp. Santa Barbara, CA, USA) following the protocol described by McCutchan and Shackel [57]. Shaded leaves were wrapped in plastic bags covered with aluminum foil at least one hour before Ψstem measurements. All measurements were taken in less than one hour with three leaves at each point, one in each single vine.On the other hand, fIPAR was measured from 11:00 to 13:00 h (GMT+2) using a portable ceptometer (AccuPAR Linear PAR, Decagon Devices, Inc., Pullman, WA, USA) on the same dates as Ψstem. Incident PAR above and below vines was measured in five vines in a row per point. Measurements were conducted in horizontal position at ground level and perpendicular to vine row. In order to cover vine spacing, five equally spaced measurements were determined in an open space adjacent to each vine. Vine structural parameters such as height and canopy width perpendicular to the row were also measured on each occasion. These data were used to calculate fIPARd through the hourly Oyarzun model [54] and further used to validate remote sensing fAPAR. The canopy porosity parameter of Oyarzun’s model was adjusted so that the instantaneous measured value of fIPAR agreed with the simulated value.2.5. Satellite Imagery and Biophysical VariablesMultispectral instruments on Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellites provide high resolution multispectral shortwave observations of Earth’s surface with a geometric revisit time at the equator of 5 days [58]. S2 overpass through the study site was between 10:36 and 10:50 GTM. S2 images at level-2A were downloaded for the study site from Copernicus Open Access hub (https://scihub.copernicus.eu/ (last accessed on 15 November 2022)) using the Sentinelsat library (https://sentinelsat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ (last accessed on 15 November 2022)). Biophysical variables of the vegetation were estimated from the S2 biophysical processor [39] available in the SNAP software v8.0 (https://step.esa.int/main/download/snap-download/, last accessed on 11 December 2021). This processor relies on building a randomized dataset of vegetation biophysical variables from which reflectance simulations by the radiative transfer models (RTM) PROSPECT and SAIL are produced [59]. Therefore, instantaneous values of biophysical variables were obtained at the time of the satellite overpass for those days under clear sky conditions. In total, 23 and 22 S2 images were processed from April to October for 2020 and 2021, respectively. fAPAR was empirically regressed with both instantaneous and daily modeled fiPAR (fIPARd). Then, each time a S2 image was available, fAPAR of each irrigation sector was converted to fIPARd and assimilated into the digital twin to calculate grapevine water requirements (Equation (1)). In addition, the leaf area index (LAI) and the fractional vegetation cover (FVC) were used to derive actual evapotranspiration with the TSEB-PT model.2.6. Actual and Potential Evapotranspiration Using Copernicus-Based InputsSentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B images from the sea and land surface radiometer (SLSTR) were downloaded to obtain LST at 1 km resolution. In total, 99 and 111 cloud-free S3 images were processed in 2020 and 2021 for the same period mentioned for S2. The DMS approach [49] was used, combining S2 and S3 images to sharpen 1 km coarse spatial resolution LST from S3 to 20 m. The methodology used is described by Guzinski et al. [50]. Meteorological inputs were obtained from the European Center of Medium Weather Forecast (ECMWF) ERA5 reanalysis dataset [60]. This dataset has a 30 km grid and was used to run the TSEB-PT model. For the current study, the variables used were air temperature at 2 m, dew point temperature at 2 m, wind speed at 100 m, surface pressure and total column water vapor (TCWV). In addition, aerosol optical thickness (AOT) at 550 m was obtained from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) since it is not included in ERA5. Two ancillary sources of data were also used: land cover maps from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-land-cover?tab=overview, last accessed on 10 October 2021) and the digital elevation model (DEM) of the shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM). In the study site, the C3S landcover map, produced at 300 m resolution, did not vary from one year to another, and so the one from 2017 was used for both years. A look-up table of different parameters associated to each crop class was set up in accordance with Guzinski et al. [50].The TSEB-PT modeling approach [61] estimates the energy fluxes of both soil and canopy, separately based on a single bulk LST measurement that initially assumes a maximum potential rate of transpiration. This first guess, which usually starts with an alpha coefficient of 1.26, is sequentially reduced until realistic fluxes are obtained [62]. This model has been used to derive land-surface energy fluxes using Copernicus-based inputs (TSEB-PTS2+S3) [50,51,52,53]. Further details on the TSEB model scheme can be found at the source code (https://github.com/hectornieto/pyTSEB., last accessed on 22 April 2022) and the original formulation of the model [42].On the other hand, potential evapotranspiration (ETp), defined as the water usage (or evapotranspiration rate) of a well-watered crop was computed from the Penman–Monteith model, assuming a maximum stomatal conductance [63,64]. ETp was therefore computed using S2 LAI estimations and the same meteorological inputs as in the TSEB-PTS2+S3. For both cases, instantaneous energy fluxes at the satellite overpass were upscaled to daily water fluxes, expressed in units of mm/day, by multiplying the instantaneous ratio of latent heat fluxes over solar irradiance by the average daily solar irradiance [65]. Gap filling was applied following the protocol described by Jofre-Cekalović et al. [53]. Both TSEB-PTS2+S3 and the Penman–Monteith estimated ET were intercompared with that modelled through the digital twin by computing their correlation as well as their root mean square deviation (RMSD=∑(xi−yi)2N). The RMSD is analogous to the root mean square error (RMSE), but denotes deviations between two independent estimates (x and y) rather than the error from one estimate to a reference measurement.3. Results and Discussion3.1. Sentinel-2 fAPARS2 fAPAR was compared with fIPAR under the hypothesis that for green canopies the latter is a good proxy of fAPAR. This assumption is valid mostly during the non-senescence periods of the growing season due to the strong absorption capacity in this spectral domain of the photosynthetic pigments [66] and the usually small background reflectivities for well-developed canopies [40,41,67]. A comparison of instantaneous S2 fAPAR with in situ measurements of fIPAR at the same time as the satellite overpassed showed an R2 of 0.61 and 0.91 for irrigation sectors with 140° and 100° row orientation, respectively (Figure 3a). These coefficients of determination are quite promising and suggest the suitability of using S2 fAPAR in discontinuous canopies, particularly in conditions without cover crop in the interrow. On the other hand, the existence of cover crop in the interrow could be a problem when estimating the biophysical parameters of the canopy, especially with the spatial resolutions provided by the current open-source satellites. The RMSD, which ranged from 0.09 to 0.10 indicated that this relationship did not significantly vary between row orientations. This deviation, however, may be explained by soil background reflectance and diffuse illumination variations due to multiscattering or also due to the poor representativeness of five vines within a 20 m pixel.

In recent years, new patterns have evolved in the agricultural industry. In conjunction with sensor scaling down and precision agriculture, the field of remote sensor networks, such as the wireless sensor network (WSN), was developed. Its major purpose is to make horticultural operations simpler to identify, assess, and manage. This paper uses the proposed DCNN to predict soil moisture and plan irrigation for precision agriculture farmers to reduce water consumption used for cultivation and increase production yield by comparing water content during various stages of plant growth and integrating IoT applications into agriculture. It also optimizes the water level for future irrigation decisions to maintain crop growth and water stability. The data must be served and stored in the form of a grid view, according to Apriori and GRU (gated recurrent unit). Using numerous sensor and parameter modelling methodologies, this system assists in the prediction of irrigation planning based on irrigation needs. The predicted parameters include soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. This observed experimental data supports smart irrigation in crop production with a high yield and little water use. DCNN has a 98.5% experimental result accuracy rate and the MSE value is predicted in DCNN 99.25% of the time.Similar content being viewed by othersCrop yield prediction algorithm (CYPA) in precision agriculture based on IoT techniques and climate changesArticle Open access30 April 2023Precision Farming in Modern AgricultureChapter © 2021Intelligent detection for sustainable agriculture: A review of IoT-based embedded systems, cloud platforms, DL, and ML for plant disease detectionArticle 06 February 2024Use our pre-submission checklistAvoid common mistakes on your manuscript.IntroductionBy installing IoT devices in the field, the agricultural industry is focused on IoT technology to get benefits rapidly and with low investment, making farming innovative and high-tech. Sensors, which are part of the overall environmental monitoring and management system, are essential to WSNs. Sensors in the irrigation fields collect data and store it for later use in the operation. Different types of sensors are used in smart sensor irrigation systems such as light, temperature, rain, level, soil moisture, and flow. Big data analysis (BDA) is a term used to describe analytical workloads that include complex analyses and many data types and a mix of data volume, velocity, and range. Agriculture necessitates crop production prediction models, economic models, pest and crop disease prediction models, and other types of data analysis. In agriculture, big data analytics may be used to analyze large amounts of structured and unstructured data to create quicker and more reliable results that can assist farmers in making better choices as shown in Fig. 1.Fig. 1Graphical abstractFull size imageClimate research and forecasting for agriculture, environmental change, determining on modifications in trimming designs, producing benchmarking datasets, data reconciliation and interoperability provided by sensors and equipment used in greenhouses, and accuracy horticulture, agro-warning frameworks, text, voice, picture, and video preparation, water system and water appropriation composts and pesticides and their effects, geographical analysis for agribusiness, continuous announcement and derivation for horticulture, farming fund and yield protection, showcasing, and flexibly chain the executives and agribusiness. Climate predictions estimate weather averages and other climatic features from a few months to a few years in the future. Forecasters are increasingly turning to extensive Earth’s climate system models that generate such forecasts. Forecasts aid farmers in risk management since production choices are sometimes made before prices are known. Consumers profit from the availability of high-quality, low-cost food. It also helps to guarantee that markets work fairly by providing information on predicted rates.The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of connected objects – “things” – embedded with sensors, computers, and other capabilities that connect to and share data with other devices and systems over the internet (Anbarasan et al., 2019; Hsu et al., 2018). Further, smart irrigation is a novel technique for watering that is enabled through networked sensors, devices, and remote controls. Farmers and their staff gain real-time visibility into the irrigation process and the ability to automate their operations. A gated recurrent unit (GRU) is a type of recurrent neural network that uses connections between nodes to accomplish machine learning tasks like memory and grouping, such as voice recognition.The main contributor of the paper is as follows: this study uses the suggested DCNN to forecast soil moisture and plan irrigation for precision agriculture producers to minimize water consumption utilized for cultivation and boost crop yield by analyzing water content throughout various phases of plant growth and integrating IoT applications into agriculture. According to Apriori and GRU, data must be delivered and stored in the form of a grid display (gated recurrent unit). This system aids in the prediction of irrigation planning based on irrigation demands by utilizing different sensor and parameter modelling approaches.The paper is discussed as follows: the “Introduction” section discusses the introduction; the “Literature survey” section discusses the literature survey; the problem statement and objective of the proposed method are discussed in the “Problem statements” and “Objective” sections, respectively; the “System model” section describes the system model; the “Result and discussion” section discusses the result and discussion; finally, the “Conclusion” section describes the conclusion of the work.Literature surveyA multiple WSN data collection technique for edge computation was used to increase valid data volume while reducing data collection time (Li et al., 2020a). WSN architecture is established first by merging edge computing and data gathering models into a WSN for many jobs and sensors. WSN uses the sensor network architecture. This sort of architecture may be seen in a range of places, including hospitals, schools, highways, and buildings, and it is used for a variety of purposes, including security, disaster management, and crisis management. A data administration system with an edge computing differential data management system. It protects sensor cloud privacy and addresses sensor cloud storage concerns (Wang et al., 2020). In terms of time, data quality, and energy usage, the findings suggest that the proposal outperforms traditional data gathering techniques.Agriculture underwent a big data study investigation, especially from a technical standpoint. The 34 research papers analyzing the issue, the solution that may be implemented, the tools/methods employed, and the data used were discovered and examined (Kamilaris et al., 2017; Khan et al., 2018). In light of big data and the necessity to clean up multi-dimensional function data, mobile edge nodes are being utilized to clean data. The training data for the cleaning model is obtained using the ABOD algorithm (Sharma et al., 2018). Angle-based outlier detection (ABOD) is a relatively new approach for detecting outliers in large datasets. ABOD evaluates the broadness of a point’s angle spectrum as an outlier factor, rather than looking at neighbourhoods as proximity-based ideas.In this study, modified Z-SEPs for varied agricultural contexts were used. Area 0 divides the field into 2 areas such as heading Area 1 and direction Area 2 (Singh et al., 2019). Data is sent to BS using the clustering process. The proposed simulated data demonstrate that utilizing modified Z-SEP enhances node stability by around 23% in agricultural usage when compared to LEACH and 27% when compared to SEP (Shah et al., 2016). For an Agro Advisory Program, a Big Data research framework is presented. For the creation of big data applications, an analytical framework is also being created and deployed. The Big Data Analytical Tool is a highly valuable systematic tool that helps to understate data and understand data from many viewpoints (Kumar & Nagar, 2017; White et al., 2018). This framework offers and uses an analytical tool to design applications for big data (Wachowiak et al., 2017). A formal way for analyzing massive data, improving judgments, and increasing animal precision is the predictive analytical approach. Predictive analytics is a type of advanced data analytics that involves evaluating historical data to make predictions about future outcomes. This method uses statistical modelling, data mining, and machine learning tools and techniques to evaluate previously collected data and provide accurate and actionable insights. The predictive analysis technique completes the final model evaluation by providing a predictive accuracy assessment, which includes an estimated chance that events and non-events described in the target variable would be observed (Harish Kumar et al., 2017).As a new topic in agriculture, the paper examines the continuous nature of a variety of difficulties, including data security, data quality, availability, initial investment, infrastructure, and associated knowledge (Sarker et al., 2019; Surendran et al., 2019). Additional hardware and software information is used to convey data from smartphones. The farmer may operate the mobile phones at any time and from any location. It is more relevant to agriculture-dependent nations, such as India (Saxena & Dutta, 2020). The cloud sensor paradigm for data collecting has been studied and published in recent research endeavors. Then, we classified and categorized material using taxonomy (Li et al., 2020b; Ang & KahPhooiSeng, 2021). To get a better grasp of the most current applications of Big Data in smart agriculture, social and economic challenges must be addressed. This article covers data generating techniques, technology accessibility (Bhat & Huang, 2021), device accessibility, software tool accessibility, data analysis approaches, and appropriate big data applications in precision agriculture. Precision agriculture is a management technique that collects, organizes, and evaluates temporal, geographical, and interpersonal data before combining it with other data to enable management decisions based on estimated variability for improved resource utilization economy, production, dependability, competitiveness, and long-term growth of agricultural production. Apart from that, there are a few drawbacks to using big data technology extensively in agriculture (White et al., 2020; Rao & Yuan, 2021). This study also uses comparison trials to illustrate the algorithm’s dependability in terms of accuracy and time efficiency (Campos-Guillén et al., 2020). The collecting and analysis of big data, the creation of new models, and the practical and uncomplicated deployment of these models are all part of a new agricultural revolution. It will provide agronomical research with a new viewpoint (Velmurugan et al., 2021).For each action detailed in the paddy rice production and post-production phases, an approach was created that maps the activities stated in rice smart farming, the data utilized in data modelling, and the machine learning techniques used per activity. The post-production step is necessary for the items to be delivered from the manufacturer to the customer. Producers, resellers, wholesale, rural retailers, and suppliers, as well as delivery, flow on marketing functions, are all engaged in product distribution (Alfred et al., 2021).According to the mapping approach, integrating these three technologies efficiently and effectively is crucial for changing conventional rice-growing techniques into a new level of intelligence in rice precision agriculture (Cravero & Sepúlveda, 2021). Precision agriculture makes use of data from a number of sources to improve agricultural yields and reduce the cost of crop management activities such as fertilizer inputs, irrigation, and soil improvement. Precision agriculture has reduced food insecurity by allowing farmers to grow more agricultural food crops with less input than in the past. These technologies increase transparency in farming by improving record-keeping, food traceability, and documentation. It also helps in planning.The use of Big Data and Machine Learning in agriculture, as well as the detection of hurdles, adjustments, and system architecture design. This review may be of interest to computer or data scientists, as well as electrical or software engineers. The results show that manipulating large volumes of data is no longer a problem because of cloud technology (Fathi et al., 2021; Su & Wang, 2021). Proposed to utilize big data in agriculture, using the egg price of a city’s wholesale market as the study object, to investigate the influencing causes and price variations of egg price by mining and analyzing relevant agricultural big data, and then displaying the big data, in order to give a relevant scientific basis for creative e-commerce economic management.The whole generation chain is covered, including day-to-day agricultural activities (Wang et al., 2006). Farmers commonly deal with information overload, which necessitates the creation of a new data source (Sorensen et al., 2010). Temperature, soil moisture, and humidity are monitored by the sensors, and the data is communicated to farmers through third parties such as meteorological stations (Wang et al., 2007). Farmers were able to readily integrate information and make clear decisions about how to deliver certain items at the moment, so boosting their pay and meeting legislative requirements (Lan, 2012; Razi & Nath, 2019). Furthermore, the farmer’s internal arrangement and similar thinking data suggest that knowledge is developed to learn and establish a real intellectual framework (McCown et al., 2012). In a wireless sensor network (WSN) (Ojha et al., 2015) setup employing ZigBee (Gutierrez et al., 2013), several sensor nodes in a given area are employed. Temporary climate fluctuations and the elements in issue, such as evapotranspiration, affect the incidence of rains (Rawal, 2017). As a consequence, assessing climatic variables connected to agricultural productivity is crucial in avoiding a global water calamity and food shortages. The most visible agricultural initiative is to increase crop water productivity (CWP) (Lan, 2012), which allows farmers to produce more food with less water.Problem statementsAs a result, the apparent diversity in the agricultural environment may be controlled by customizing inputs to the specific regions where they are needed. As a result, this study used and enhanced the precision agriculture model to track crop growth while accounting for variables such as air temperature, soil moisture, and soil type in the field. Precision agriculture increases agricultural income and resource utilization by reducing the use of traditional management practices. Precision farming, which is focused on production yield and soil types, has an impact on crop growth. Precision agriculture can revitalize India’s agricultural economy. The presentation of erroneous estimations on water-based soil conditions is one of the limiting factors that impact crop output. Recommendations for various irrigation methods are based on socioeconomic characteristics. Some of the elements that determine irrigation farmers’ ability to use agricultural information and knowledge include socioeconomic, social, psychological, and geographical aspects. Irrigation farmers’ actions are influenced not only just by farm-related and management-related issues, but also by external institutions and socioeconomic factors.ObjectiveThe goal of the proposed research is to find limiting variables that impact agricultural productivity. The major goal is to provide practical advice to farmers that use IoT in precision agriculture to increase crop output by predicting different soil conditions. Soil moisture is influenced by a variety of factors, including precipitation, plant water consumption intensity, and air temperature. Because appropriate soil moisture is critical for yields, plants will not grow and develop if the soil moisture is insufficient. For the crops, high doses of radiation may be necessary. Excessive temperatures may have an unfavorable influence on the yield as the stages develop. During these times, farmers employ a ventilation system to keep the temperature in check. If the humidity is excessive, the illness will worsen. Soil water influences productivity as well. These components were regarded as significant data information in this research as a consequence of the prior reasoning concerning the impact of temperature, humidity, and water level on cultivation. The main purpose is to provide accurate temperature, humidity, and water data. Predicts soil moisture and adjusts irrigation as appropriate. Improving irrigation practices in precision agriculture will help to ease water constraints. Deliver timely, accurate, trustworthy, and valuable information to farmers to increase their productivity.System modelThe soil, which is recognized as a fundamental component in farming, is the key to its success. Precision agriculture detects and monitors soil moisture in real-time. To monitor soil conditions, modern agricultural monitoring technologies such as gamma-radiometric soil sensors, a soil moisture sensor, and electrical conductivity sensors are available. Gamma radiation is a kind of electromagnetic radiation with a short wavelength and a high energy level. It can penetrate solid things more deeply than light and has a spectrum of several hundred meters in the air. It refers to the detection of natural sources of gamma radiation released from the earth. Gamma radiometric measurements also distinguished doleritic, lateritic, and granitic soil parent materials efficiently. The multiple sensors used to monitor weather conditions count the crop’s physiological status. A farmer should estimate the amount of water needed for cultivation ahead of time. Water availability is influenced by climate, season, soil type, crop variety, and growth stage. The crop loses water via transpiration and evaporation in general during cultivation. Environmental factors such as terrain, climate, soil properties, and soil water all have an impact on crop yield. Because of the interplay of these four factors, certain crops can only be grown in specific locations. The system model flow graph is shown in Fig. 2.Fig. 2Proposed work flowchartFull size imageAs demonstrated in the flow graph, the S-Linear Kernel Analysis Algorithm (S_LKA) is employed to anticipate soil moisture. The K SLinear Kernel Analysis Algorithm (K_SLR) for Prediction of Current Soil Moisture (CSM) with Minimum Standard Error is used to predict soil moisture (PSM Value). Sends an “On” status to start irrigation if (Tmax>GSM) is fulfilled. The recommended deep Convolutional Neural Network Algorithm was used to assess the parameters.Precision agriculture shown in Fig. 3, for example, uses the Internet of Things to increase agricultural output over time. Precision farming makes use of the Internet of Things to collect and communicate massive quantities of field data, evaluate it, and make the best agricultural decisions possible. Table 1 shows agronomist recommendations for acceptable environmental variables that impact crop development.Fig. 3Proposed system modelFull size imageTable 1 Environmental factors affecting various cultivation stagesFull size tableData aggregationWith the use of agricultural datasets, Apriori Data Aggregation allows for prediction and call characteristics. The data is then accurately translated to determine the constant value as well as the situation, while the user is notified by phone call. Apriori Data Aggregation represents the ultimate yield level of everything developed in the horticulture zone based on information analysis. The Apriori algorithm is a foundational approach for discovering Boolean association rules from frequently occurring itemsets. It investigates the level-wise mining Apriori condition that any nonempty subsets of a frequently occurring itemset must likewise be often frequent. Accumulation and anticipation techniques use a few factors to anticipate obscure or future estimates of the different factors, using the Open Grid Service Hash-Based Validation method, which allows the user perception and value of the dataset to the viewed as a table so that the prediction of the field area is easily calculated. At the field level of the region in which the node setup occurs, the global positioning system (GPS), computer modelling, ground-based/airborne/satellite remote sensing, variable rate technology, and sophisticated information processing are utilized to detect and maintain the field level implementation for timely in-season and between-season crop management.S-linear kernel analysisConvert the observed raw sensor data to a vector representation using the sparse linear regression (SLR) method. The sparse linear regression (SLR) problem aims to calculate a k-sparse n-dimensional vector tau that minimizes the error ||M tau – q|| given a d x n matrix M and a d-dimensional query q. This issue is the geometric equivalent of the following: find the nearest k-dimensional subspace to q that is covered by a subset of k points in P, given a collection of n points P and a query point q in d dimensions. A similarity function is used by the kernel to compare two data points. Sequential data, images, and vectors are no longer accepted by the kernel function. Kernel approaches are named from the fact that they operate in high-dimensional, ambiguous feature space by generating the linear combination of all pairings of data in the feature set rather than finding the coordinates of the data. When compared to manually computing the coordinates, this approach is generally less computationally demanding. The “kernel trick” is the name for this method. Equation (1) describes the weighted similarity measure form, the similarity function, Si training sample, and S', the unlabeled input.$${S}^{\\\\wedge}=sgn\\\\sum_{i=1}^nW_iS_i{}^m\\\\left(S_i,S^\\\\prime\\\\right)$$(1)K_SLinear Kernel Analysis Algorithm (K_SLR)The K SLR algorithm’s new way of using weather forecasting datasets with k means clustering. Equation (2) represents the weighted similarity measure fork, the similarity function, St training sample, and S*, the unlabeled input for k, the similarity function, St training sample, and S*, the unlabeled input. This was conveyed in three ways.$$Z=sgn\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{W}_{i}{S}_{i}{}^{k}\\\\left({S}_{t},{S}^{*}\\\\right)$$(2)K SLinear Kernel Analysis Soil Moisture Prediction Algorithm 1 shows the algorithm, while Algorithm 2 shows the Smart Irrigation option.The irrigation will be timed to coincide with the farmer’s soil moisture threshold. Soil moisture thresholds are precise SWC values that indicate the availability of water for plant consumption. These levels are used to calculate when and how often irrigation is essential. The irrigation work is scheduled based on the threshold T and previous precipitation data, as well as the expected ground soil moisture trend. It is possible to switch on or off the water motor control. This gadget controls the relay that turns the water motor on and off. Based on the collected observations, the lowest and highest thresholds “Tmin” and “Tmax” defined in the previous algorithm will start and stop irrigation. Ground soil moisture (GSM) was predicted using MSE, and the difference between GSM and Tmax was used to determine whether irrigation should be done manually or automatically. The moisture content of the soil will normally range from 10 to 45%, although it will be higher during and after irrigation. Water is trapped in the pores of your soil, which are openings or gaps between sand grains and the interface of the sand grains. Tensiometer, moisture block, feel, and appearance are the most common ways to measure soil moisture. The motor receives the signal “1” signalling “ON.” To switch off the irrigation, it transmits the signal “0.” As a result, the system can forecast how much water is required for agriculture. Because of the lack of water, the system has a lot of potential for supporting farmers who rely on the terrestrial tank.Deep convolution neural networkThe approach may be used by farmers to identify irrigation-based decision-making by looking at the present irrigation schedule throughout the whole crop’s growth. Crop growth characteristics are utilized as input datasets in this module, which forecasts precipitation, rainfall, and evapotranspiration ranges that may sustain crop output while ensuring future soil water stability, allowing irrigation to be planned and scheduled. This system was built using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are created using deep learning, a machine learning technology. It is based on the idea of artificial neural networks (ANNs), which are designed to perform complex analyses on large amounts of data by routing it through several layers of neurons. The most common type of image and video pattern recognition system is deep convolutional neural networks (CNN or DCNN). The hydrological cycle and weather prediction both rely on soil moisture (SM). Satellites are the primary realistic tool to investigate large-scale SM dynamics on a regular basis. The radiative transfer hypothesis and satellite observations are frequently used to determine SM. A deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) can improve SM retrievals even more than the NN model.The suggested deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), a high-performance deep learning model, has been presented. Effective features data may be retrieved from challenging spectrum data using the proposed DCNN, and the important structure of feature data can be determined. Convolutional neural networks offer a higher modelling power than surface learning approaches. The suggested DCNN was utilized to evaluate soil moisture content using near-infrared spectroscopy in this study. For spectral regression, an effective DCNN modelling technique was presented. This modelling strategy reduced the time it took to preprocess spectrum data and increased the accuracy of spectral prediction.Structure of DCNNThe capacity of multilayer networks to tackle a range of real-world problems with levels of accuracy that typical machine learning approaches have yet to attain has renewed interest in them. Proposed deep convolutional neural networks have achieved a lot of success in image analysis. The name refers to a neural network with a special network design in which each so-called hidden layer includes two unique layers: the first one is the result of a localized convolution of the preceding layer, and the next is a max-pooling stage, which drastically decreases the number of units by retaining just the maximum response of many units from the first stage. Following a series of concealed layers, the last layer is usually fully linked. Each network-predicted class has its unit that takes input from the others. Figure 4 shows the proposed DCNN structure.Fig. 4Structure of DCNNFull size imageThe MSE based accuracy expressed in Eq. (3).$$MSE=\\\\frac1n\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\left(z_i-z_i^\\\\wedge\\\\right)^2$$(3)The coefficient of determination R, which is used to identify the soil qualities exploited by rainfall and runoff, is represented by the R factor. The R factor changes depending on how much rain falls each day.Every month, the R factor calculation methodologies outlined in equations are supplied.$${R}^{2}=1-\\\\frac{\\\\sum \\\\left(z-{z}_{m}{}^{2}\\\\right)}{\\\\sum \\\\left(z-{z}_{0}{}^{2}\\\\right)}$$(4)where Z is observed data, zm modelled value, and z0 mean of the observed value.$$RMSE={[\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\\\left({S}_{fi}-{S}_{oi}{}^{2}\\\\right)/N]}^{{^1}/{_2}}$$(5)where f forecasts, o observed value, N sample size, are the difference squared$$VI{F}_{i}=\\\\frac{1}{1-{R}_{i}{}^{2}}$$(6)where the coefficient of determination 2iR.The approach, which is based on the new CNN_ Algorithm, enables users to evaluate and implement irrigation schedules that are most advantageous to their agricultural conditions. By predicting precipitation and evapotranspiration range estimates and creating soil water stability via regulated irrigation, the system’s complexity is tempered and integrated, resulting in increased output yield. As a consequence, the system’s uniqueness comes from the hybridized mix of the artificial neural network (ANN) and the Genetic Algorithm (GA). ANN is a commonly used machine learning approach that analyzes previous data to forecast patterns, whereas GA is an algorithm that can locate better subsets of input parameters for integrating into ANN, increasing the accuracy of prediction through optimized feature selection. The proposed DCNN makes advantage of the irrigation water that is pushed. The precipitation event had been well projected, notwithstanding the necessity to alter rainfall depths. The crop increase version of the soil water content tiers tracked the trend of soil humidity measurements while effectively predicting canopy cover patterns and seed cotton output, particularly on drip-irrigated plots. The proposed DCNN-based feature determines the best parameter, in this case, resulting in a classification system. The decision unit function of a neural network evaluates incoming input and initializes the population function. The population measures the yield at the senescence (Maturity) stage when the crop reaches its greatest height. The plant’s fruits and vegetables are now ready to be picked. After utilizing the proposed DCNN Algorithm to initialize the population, the mutation starts measuring irrigation levels in the field, which are dependent on plant development stages. Emergence, fast growth, lag growth, and senescence are the four phases of plant development. Finally, the fitness function was evaluated by determining the system’s MSE error rate, as well as identifying variations and evaluating performance using R2, RMSE, and other prediction measures. The water level in the field is checked. As a consequence, the system’s crop suggestions assist farmers in making the greatest precision agriculture selections possible.Result and discussionData collection and experimental setupThe environmental factors that are monitored include soil temperature, soil humidity, and water level. The data were collected utilizing several irrigation treatment sub-plots on a cotton-growing field in Southern Tamilnadu. Irrigation Area Guaranteed Historically, the satta system was used in several parts of Eastern India. Farmers had to apply for water each season under this arrangement, but they did not have to indicate which crops they wanted; paddy was assumed. Water had to be given to each farmer in sufficient quantities to allow the crop to mature. For a month, sensor observations were made at 8 a.m., 10 a.m., 12 p.m., 2 p.m., and 4 p.m. The humidity sensors were utilized to gather data on moisture every 60 min regularly. In addition, statistical downscaling of precipitation was investigated to for\", 'unique_identifier': 197}\n",

This study aims to examine the spatiotemporal patterns of ET0 and facilitate the monitoring of crop water demand, optimize irrigation water usage, and enhance agricultural advisory services. This paper estimates regional-level daily ET0 gridded data with a spatial resolution of 12.5 km by integrating observed weather data, IMD GFS-T1534 reanalysis data, and INSAT-3D satellite-based insolation product using the standard FAO56 Penman–Monteith empirical equation. The estimated monthly mean of ET0 across India ranged from 10 to 400 mm. ET0 exhibited an increasing trend from January to May, reaching its maximum values in May. In June, ET0 significantly decreased as the monsoon arrived, coinciding with the movement of rainfall patterns. The month of December exhibited the lowest ET0 values. The estimated daily gridded ET0 was compared with station-based ET0, resulting in daily correlation coefficient R2 and daily maximum absolute percentage errors ranging from 0.34 to 0.90 and 10% to 27% respectively. However, these errors decreased to a large extent when considering multiday accumulated values. A comparison was conducted between the GLDAS model ET0 and the station-estimated values, revealing an overestimation of ET0 by the GLDAS model. Additionally, significant variations were observed among the meteorological subdivisions. This highlights the necessity for proper calibration of the GLDAS model ET0 or its effective agricultural application.Similar content being viewed by othersEstimation of evapotranspiration from ground-based meteorological data and global land data assimilation system (GLDAS)Article 23 December 2014Estimation of Satellite-Based Regional-Scale Evapotranspiration for Agriculture Water Management Using Penman–Monteith MethodChapter © 2022Spatio-temporal Variation of Evapotranspiration Derived from Multi-temporal Landsat Datasets using FAO-56 Penman-Monteith MethodChapter © 2021Use our pre-submission checklistAvoid common mistakes on your manuscript.IntroductionAgriculture holds significant importance in driving the socio-economic growth of developing countries such as India, serving as the primary source of livelihood for a substantial portion of the population. As per the 2011 Census, the agricultural and allied sector activities engage 54.6% of the total workforce (Annual Report 2020–21, 2021). Adequate water availability at the right time is crucial for agriculture as it directly influences crop yields. However, the impact of climate change has resulted in irregular precipitation patterns (Soni et al. 2023), leading to adverse effects on agricultural productivity in the country (Abeysekara et al. 2023; Jha et al. 2023; Ondrasek 2014; Zhang et al. 2023; Zizinga et al. 2022). Various meteorological and agriculture departments actively engage in providing agricultural advisories to farmers. Among these advisories, information on when to irrigate and how much to irrigate holds great significance for farmers (Cahn and Johnson 2017; Lorite et al. 2012). It not only helps farmers to save money and enhance crop productivity but also reduces excessive water usage in irrigation.Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a significant role in soil water balance models and various crop water requirement-based models, following precipitation. These models are instrumental in obtaining accurate estimates for irrigation scheduling (Zhang et al. 2011), optimizing irrigation practices, understanding crop water requirements, and predicting yields (Attia et al. 2022; Chen et al. 2023; Lee et al. 2022; Wu et al. 2022). The availability of daily or weekly ET data, along with current soil moisture conditions and weather forecasts, is invaluable in accurately determining crop water requirements and helpful in providing timely irrigation advisories. This integrated approach enhances the effectiveness of water resource management and aids in optimizing agricultural practices (Vuolo et al. 2015).Evapotranspiration (ET) encompasses the combined water loss from the Earth\\'s surface through soil evaporation and plant transpiration (Allen et al. 1998a; Kite 2000). Evapotranspiration (ET) includes various terms, namely potential evapotranspiration (PET), reference evapotranspiration (ET0), and actual evapotranspiration (AET). PET represents the maximum amount of water that could evaporate and be transpired under optimal conditions, assuming an adequate water supply without considering soil moisture constraints. ET0 serves as a benchmark, representing the evaporative demand for a reference crop, such as well-watered grass, considering sufficient water availability. It helps estimate crop water requirements in diverse regions and crops. On the other hand, AET refers to the measured or estimated water loss (evaporation and transpiration) specific to a particular crop. AET can be derived from ET0 by multiplying it with the crop coefficient (kc) (Allen et al. 1998b; Pereira et al. 1999).The estimation of evapotranspiration relies on various techniques that utilizes meteorological and satellite data inputs. Several empirical equations have been developed to estimate evapotranspiration; however, these methods have limitations in terms of data availability and adaptability at the local scale (Hargreaves and Samani 1985; Priestley and Taylor 1972; Thornthwaite 1948; Zhang et al. 2008). Empirical method Penman may require wind calibration (Malek 1994), the radiation method performs well in humid conditions where aerodynamic influence contribution is comparatively small (Tabari et al. 2013; Vishwakarma et al. 2022) and temperature based empirical methods require local calibration (Lee 2010). These empirical methods are suitable to estimate the water demand at low spatial resolution and monthly time scale. Among the available methods FAO-56 Penman Monteith (PM) empirical method estimates evapotranspiration relatively accurately and performs consistently for arid, semi-arid, and humid conditions at a global scale (Abdollahnejad et al. 2018; Allen et al. 1998a; Subedi and Chávez 2015) as it includes both thermodynamics and aerodynamic aspects. FAO 56 Penman Monteith, a globally accepted empirical equation for estimating evapotranspiration, requires multiple inputs such as air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, and relative humidity. However, these inputs are often scarce and rarely available across space, making it challenging to accurately estimate water demand. In developing countries like India, most of the studies have predominantly focused on the point scale due to limited weather station coverage and inconsistent data, which are insufficient for capturing precise spatial variability and translate this information in agriculture advisories. Choudhury 1997 estimated the monthly global PET from the satellite data in which satellite-derived solar radiation, fractional cloud cover, air temperature, and vapour pressure were used. Polar and geostationary satellite derived near surface air temperature and insolation were used to estimate PET estimation in most of the studies (Bois et al. 2008; Cruz-Blanco et al. 2014). Baik and Choi 2015 estimated geostationary satellite-based Priestley-Taylor PET which was compared with high quality, global land surface model GLDAS (25 km) based PET and found significantly overestimated. Rao et al. 2012, estimated station-based PET for 51 stations using 8 different empirical methods and found that the modified Penman Monteith overestimated mostly during summer and Hargreaves method performed better during the northeast monsoon season compared to the other three season. Over the past three decades, numerous researchers have dedicated their efforts to estimating evapotranspiration using various approaches such as satellite data, meteorological data, or a combination of both (Bhattarai et al. 2016; Huerta et al. 2022; Ha et al. 2020; Singer et al. 2021; Vyas et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2016). However, despite these advancements, the full utilization of these methods and datasets is hindered by several challenges. One of the main hurdles is the scarcity of calibration and validation of datasets, which affects the accuracy and reliability of the estimations.Evapotranspiration estimation is significantly influenced by solar radiation, as it is directly proportional to it. Even small uncertainties in solar radiation measurements can introduce considerable errors in evapotranspiration estimation (Heck et al. 2020). However, due to limitations in the availability and consistency of solar radiation data, an alternative solution for estimating evapotranspiration can be found in satellite-derived high spatial and temporal remote-sensed meteorological data. To address the uncertainties in solar radiation, this study developed and discussed a data integration approach that combines remotely sensed insolation products with observed daily meteorological data. This integration enables the estimation of near real-time evapotranspiration at a spatial resolution of 12.5 km and a daily temporal scale for the entire country of India. Although models such as the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) also provide daily evapotranspiration estimates, these models tend to overestimate evapotranspiration and cannot be directly used without proper calibration and validation at the regional scale. This paper focuses on the discussion and validation of the estimated regional evapotranspiration (ET0) specifically in the context of its application in agriculture advisory services. The paper is organized as follows: Section \"Material and methods\", the paper comprehensively addressed the various components of the study. This encompassed discussions about the station observational data covering the 34 meteorological sub-divisions, the INSAT 3D insolation product, the gridded observed temperature product, and the GLDAS-based evapotranspiration. Moreover, the paper also provided insights into the process of deriving the estimated evapotranspiration, outlined the statistical methods utilized for error computation, and described the calibration procedure employed for result comparison. Section \"Results and discussions\"  focused on the patterns of monthly evapotranspiration throughout the region, scrutinizing its 3 days to monthly and sub-divisional variations. The calibration coefficients for both proposed derived ET0 and GLDAS model-based ET0 were presented, alongside statistical comparisons, accuracy assessments, and an exploration of the daily temporal variation at the sub-division level. Finally, in the Summary and Conclusion section, paper discussed the potential use of satellite data in enhancing the quality of agriculture advisories in India and improving various models through the utilization of calibrated proposed evapotranspiration.Material and methodsStudy AreaThis study primarily centers on the Indian subcontinent, encompassing a geographical range of latitude 7.5° to 37.5° N and longitude 67.5° to 97.5° E. The vast size and diverse topography of India contribute to its remarkably varied climate. The agricultural sector and water resources in India greatly rely on the southwest monsoon season. This period holds significant importance as certain regions receive as much as 75% of their annual rainfall during this time, making it a crucial determinant of the country\\'s overall annual precipitation where annual rainfall ranges from 1100 to 2000 mm per year and distribution of rainfall over land mass varies widely. From 1901–2020 the monthly mean of average temperature varies between 18° C to 29° C with annual mean average of 24° C.The climate of India can be categorized into different regions, including tropical, subtropical, and arid/semi-arid regions. The tropical regions are predominantly located in the southern and eastern parts of the country and are characterized by consistently high temperatures throughout the year. Subtropical regions, located in the northern and central parts of India, experience seasonal variations in temperature with hot summers and cold winters. These regions receive rainfall primarily during the monsoon season, although in lesser amounts compared to the tropical regions. Arid or semi-arid regions are primarily situated in the northwest and western parts of India. These regions face low and erratic rainfall throughout the year, resulting in drought conditions and water scarcity (Rajeevan and Nayak 2017; Soni et al. 2023). India is divided into 36 meteorological subdivisions based on the unique rainfall patterns observed across the country (Fig. 1).Fig. 1SRTM DEM and spatial distribution of IMD Agromet stations in meteorological subdivisions of India as follows (1.

Lakshadweep)Full size imageDataObserved station dataIn this study, we selected 34 Agrometeorological observatories (Table 1) to ensure representation from each meteorological subdivision (Fig. 1). This strategic selection facilitated effective validation and calibration of the estimated evapotranspiration (ET0). The Agromet observatories are equipped with sensors to measure various weather variables including maximum and minimum temperature, maximum and minimum relative humidity, rainfall, bright sunshine hours, and evaporation. These stations cover a wide range of conditions, including rainfed and irrigated areas, diverse weather patterns, topography, and soil types. Consequently, the impact of weather and other physical variables was thoroughly investigated. Ground observations from agricultural fields were collected for the years 2017 and 2018.Table 1 Details of IMD Agromet observatories and data usedFull size tableIMD gridded temperature dataTemperature is a critical parameter in the estimation of evapotranspiration, and the use of accurate data is of utmost importance. In this study, we utilized gridded maximum and minimum temperature data obtained from the National Climate Centre (NCC) of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) (https://www.imdpune.gov.in/lrfindex.php, accessed on August 24th, 2021). This dataset is available at a daily frequency with a spatial resolution of 0.5°×0.5° (approximately 2500 km2). It has been found to be highly reliable compared to other datasets available for the Indian region, exhibiting an error of less than 0.5 °C during cross-validation. Moreover, this dataset successfully captures the mean frequency of cold and heat waves, as well as temperature anomalies associated with monsoon breaks (Srivastava et al. 2009).SRTM DEM dataSRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) DEM (Digital Elevation Model) data provides elevation information for nearly the entire Earth’s surface, covering approximately 80% of the globe. It is a joint collaboration between National Aeronautic Space Administration (NASA), National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), and the German Aerospace Center (DLR). It has been widely used in various applications such as geology, hydrology, cartography, and terrain analysis. In this study, we utilized SRTM 90 m (3 Arc second) spatial resolution DEM data (Version 4). This dataset can be accessed through platforms like the United States Geological Survey (USGS), NASA\\'s Earthdata Search, and the CGIAR-CSI SRTM 90 m Database (https://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/ accessed on 28th August 2021). SRTM radar used C and X bands for the preparation of DEM data which has been further processed to fill data voids. (Jarvis et al. 2008).Satellite derived insolation dataINSAT 3D (Indian Geostationary satellite) insolation product, 3DIMG_L2C_INS, provides data with a spatial resolution of 4 km and a temporal resolution of 30 min over the Asia Mercator region. This region spans from 44.5°E to 105.5°E longitude and 10.0°S to 45.5°N latitude. Insolation refers to the total amount of solar radiation flux or irradiance in the shortwave range of 0.3 to 3 µm, which reaches the ground and consists of a combination of direct and diffuse components of solar radiation fluxes. In the retrieval of insolation data from INSAT 3D, two approaches are primarily utilized: statistical or empirical methods (Tarpley 1979) and physical or radiative transfer methods (Tanahashi et al. 2001). These approaches estimate surface insolation by making use of visible and thermal bands. The estimation of instantaneous and daily insolation is achieved through the implementation of a spectrally integrated irradiance model and a three-layer cloudy model, using the INSAT 3D visible (VIS), water vapor (WV), and thermal infrared (IR) bands (Bhattacharya et al. 2013). A trapezoidal integration was applied to construct the daily value from the instantaneous global irradiances in MJm−2. The INSAT 3D insolation product exhibits significantly higher accuracy compared to other available products, such as Heliosat SARAH-E and the NASA MERRA-2 reanalysis product, with improvements of approximately 42.5% and 43.8% respectively (Kamath and Srinivasan 2020).Weather forecast model GFS T1534 reanalysis productsIMD runs weather forecast model GFS T1534 twice daily (00 and 12 UTC) on a horizontal spatial scale of 12.5 km and on a vertical scale of 64 hybrid sigma-pressure layers with a top layer centered around 0.27 hPa (~55 km) to generate 10 days’ deterministic forecast in advance on MIHIR HPCS (Sridevi et al. 2020). The model gives the post-processed output parameters at 25 km and 12.5 km spatial resolution. The atmospheric forecast model used in GFS is a global spectral model (GSM) with spherical harmonic functions. The IMD GFS T1534 operational model’s dynamical core is based on two-time level semi-implicit Lagrangian discretization with three dimensional Hermite interpolation (Sela 2010). The initial conditions are prepared at BHASKARA HPCS, NCMRWF to run the IMD-GFS model using NCEP Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) based hybrid Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) (Buehner et al. 2013). The model is based on the usual expressions of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy at T1534 spectral truncation 12.5 km physics Gaussian grid and 64 levels in a hybrid sigma-pressure vertical grid (Kumar et al. 2019). The detailed structure and physics of the Global Forecast System (GFS) are available at http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/GFS/doc.php.Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS)The GLDAS model integrates satellite and ground-based information using advanced land surface modelling and data assimilation techniques to produce the optimal field of land surface states and fluxes (Rodell et al. 2004). The reanalysed datasets through the common land model (CLM), variable infiltration capacity model (VIC), and Noah LSM are available at GLDAS websites (http://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/gldas/) at various spatial scales (0.25° and 1°) and temporal scale (3 h and monthly). In this study, the GLDAS 0.25° (GLDAS_NOAH025_3H 2.1) has been used.MethodologyThe FAO-56 Penman–Monteith empirical method is widely employed for accurately estimating reference evapotranspiration (ET0). However, this method necessitates a significant number of weather inputs, including radiation, relative humidity, air temperature, wind speed, and vapor pressure. Unfortunately, these inputs are often not readily available at a suitable spatial and temporal scale in standard weather observatories. To address this issue of data scarcity from ground stations, we utilized a derived insolation product from the geostationary satellite INSAT-3D to estimate net radiation. Additionally, we incorporated observed India Meteorological Department (IMD) gridded temperature data, IMD GFS model-based reanalysed data for relative humidity and wind speed, and SRTM DEM elevation data. The inclusion of observed and analysed inputs in the model yielded comparatively more accurate results in comparison to utilizing a general model for estimating ET0.FAO-56 Penman–Monteith empirical reference ET 0 frameworkIn 1948, Penman developed an empirical equation to estimate evaporation from an open water surface (Penman 1948). This equation takes into account meteorological parameters such as sunshine, temperature, humidity, and wind speed, utilizing an approach based on energy balance and mass transfer (see Fig. 2 and Table 2). Subsequently, this method was expanded to include cropped surfaces by incorporating factors such as aerodynamic resistance and surface resistance. The FAO proposed a standard parameterization of the Penman–Monteith empirical method (Monteith 1981) for the estimation of daily grass reference evapotranspiration (ET0) from a well-irrigated, homogenous, 0.12 m grass crop height, a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m-1, and an albedo of 0.23 (Allen et al. 1998a). This empirical method, hereafter referred to as PM, is a standard worldwide acceptable method to compute the daily reference ET0 in mm and calculated as follows:$${ET}_{0}=\\\\frac{0.408\\\\Delta \\\\left({R}_{n}-G\\\\right)+\\\\gamma \\\\frac{900}{T+273}{u}_{2}({e}_{s}-{e}_{a})}{\\\\Delta +\\\\gamma (1+0.34{u}_{2})}$$(1)where ET0 is the grass-reference evapotranspiration in mm day−1, Rn is net solar radiance at crop surface in MJ m−2 day−1, G is solar heat flux density in MJ m−2 day−1, T is the air temperature at 2 m height in °C, u2 is the wind speed at 2 m height in m s−1, es is saturation vapour pressure in kPa, ea is actual vapour pressure in kPa, (es—ea) is saturation vapour pressure deficit in kPa, ∆ is slope vapour pressure curve in kPa °C−1, γ is psychrometric constant equivalent to 0.665×10–3 P in kPa °C−1.Fig. 2Flow chart to estimate daily ET0 using FAO-56 Penman Monteith empirical frameworkFull size imageTable 2 Data usedFull size tableSaturation vapour pressure eo(T) kPa at temperature T °C is computed using below empirical equation$${e}^{o}\\\\left(T\\\\right)=0.6108{\\\\text{exp}}\\\\left[\\\\frac{17.27{\\\\text{T}}}{{\\\\text{T}}+237.3}\\\\right]$$(2)Due to the nonlinearity of Eq. 2, the mean saturation vapour pressure for a day should be computed as the mean between the saturation vapour pressure at the mean daily maximum and minimum air temperature for that period.$${e}_{s}=\\\\frac{{e}^{o}({T}_{max})+{e}^{o}({T}_{min})}{2}$$(3)Actual vapour pressure (ea) computed from the relative humidity and saturation vapour pressure using below empirical equation$${e}_{a}=\\\\frac{{e}^{o}\\\\left({T}_{min}\\\\right)*\\\\frac{{RH}_{max}}{100}+{e}^{o}\\\\left({T}_{max}\\\\right)*\\\\frac{{RH}_{min}}{100}}{2}$$(4)The slope vapour pressure curve (∆) [kPa °C-1] at a given ait temperature T°C is computed by$$\\\\Delta =\\\\frac{4098 [0.6108exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{17.27T}{T+237.3}\\\\right)]}{{(T+237.2)}^{2}}$$(5)The psychrometric constant (γ) is computed using P daily mean atmospheric pressure (kPa), λ the latent heat of vaporization (2.45 MJ kg−1), Cp the specific heat at constant pressure (1.013×10–3 MJ kg−1 °C−1), ε ratio molecular weight of water vapor/ dry air (0.622) given by$$\\\\gamma =\\\\frac{{C}_{p}P}{\\\\varepsilon \\\\lambda }=0.000665 P$$(6)where mean atmospheric pressure P (kPa) can be computed from the elevation in meters z by using the below equation$$P=101.3 (\\\\frac{293-0.0065 z}{293}{)}^{5.26}$$(7)Wind speed at 2 m height is required to compute ET0. Generally, in meteorology operations anemometers are placed at 10 m height and in agrometeorology it is placed at the 2 m or 3 m height. To adjust the wind speed data a logarithmic wind speed profile is used for measurement above a short-grassed surface$${u}_{2}={u}_{z} \\\\frac{4.87}{{\\\\text{ln}}(67.8 z-5.42)}$$(8)The soil heat flux (G) is the energy that is used in heating the soil. The positive value of G shows that the soil is warming and negative value of G shows the soil is cooling. In the estimation of ET0, soil heat flux is negligible compared to Rn when the surface is fully covered with vegetation$$G\\\\approx 0$$(9)Net solar radiation (MJ m−2 day−1) is the difference between net shortwave solar radiation and net longwave solar radiation.$${R}_{n}={R}_{net\\\\;shortwave}-{R}_{net\\\\;longwave}$$(10)$${R}_{net\\\\;shortwave}=\\\\left(1-\\\\alpha \\\\right) {R}_{Surface\\\\;insolation}$$(11)where α is the albedo of a hypothetical grass reference crop with a value of 0.23 (Allen et al. 1998a).The earth absorbs the solar radiation and converts it to heat energy. Some of the longwave radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere and some of loses into space. Net longwave solar radiation (Rnl) is computed using the empirical equation$${R}_{nl}=\\\\sigma \\\\left[\\\\frac{{T}_{max, k}^{4}+{T}_{min, k}^{4}}{2}\\\\right]\\\\left(0.34-0.14\\\\sqrt{{e}_{a}}\\\\right)\\\\left(1.35\\\\frac{{R}_{s}}{{R}_{so}}-0.35\\\\right)$$(12)where Rnl is net outgoing longwave radiation (MJ m−2 day−1), σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant (4.903 X 10–9 MJ K−2 m−2 day−1), Tmax, k is the maximum absolute temperature during 24 h period in Kelvin, Tmin, k is minimum absolute temperature during 24 h period in Kelvin, ea is actual vapour pressure (kPa), Rs is solar radiation (MJ m−2 day−1), Rso is clear sky radiation (MJ m−2 day−1), and Rs/Rso is relative shortwave radiation (limited to≤1.0).Clear sky radiation can be computed$${R}_{so}=\\\\left(0.75+2 X {10}^{-5} Z\\\\right) {R}_{a}$$(13)where Z is the station elevation above sea level (m) and Ra is the extraterrestrial radiation (MJ m−2 day−1).The extraterrestrial radiation can be computed$${R}_{a}=\\\\frac{24 \\\\left(60\\\\right)}{\\\\Pi }{G}_{sc}{d}_{r}\\\\left[{\\\\omega }_{s}{\\\\text{sin}}\\\\left(\\\\phi \\\\right){\\\\text{sin}}\\\\left(\\\\delta \\\\right)+{\\\\text{cos}}\\\\left(\\\\phi \\\\right){\\\\text{cos}}\\\\left(\\\\delta \\\\right){\\\\text{sin}}\\\\left({\\\\omega }_{s}\\\\right)\\\\right]$$(14)where Ra is extraterrestrial radiation (MJ m−2 day−1), Gsc is solar constant equal to 0.0820 MJ m−2 min−1, dr is inverse relative distance between Earth and Sun, ωs is sunset hour angle in radian, ϕ is latitude in radian, δ is solar decimation in radian.$${d}_{r}=1+0.033\\\\;cos\\\\;\\\\left(\\\\frac{2\\\\Pi J}{365}\\\\right)$$(15)$$\\\\delta =0.409\\\\;{\\\\text{sin}}\\\\;\\\\left(\\\\frac{2\\\\Pi J}{365}-1.39\\\\right)$$(16)where dr is inverse distance between the earth and the sun, δ is the solar decimation angle, and J is the number of days between 1 to 365 or 366 in Julian date.$${\\\\omega }_{s}=arccos\\\\left(-{\\\\text{tan}}(\\\\phi ){\\\\text{tan}}(\\\\delta )\\\\right)$$(17)where ωs is sunset hour angle and ranges between -1 to 1.Daylight hours are calculated from the sunset angle in radians$$N = \\\\frac{24 {\\\\omega }_{s}}{\\\\pi }$$(18)Solar radiation is derived from the station measured bright sunshine hours (BSSH) and day light hours (N) using an empirical equation.$$Solar\\\\;Radiation=a+\\\\left(\\\\frac{b*BSSH}{N}\\\\right)* {R}_{a}$$(19)where a=0.25 and b=0.5 are constants, Ra is extraterrestrial radiation and N is daylight hours.Statistical analysis used for error estimationA statistical analysis was conducted to compare the estimates from weather stations with the estimated gridded reference evapotranspiration (ET0) data. Evaluation metrics such as mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), and Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) were calculated at both daily and monthly temporal scales.Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)MAPE is a measure of prediction accuracy in the percentage of predicted (P) with respect to observed data (O). It is calculated using the below empirical equation$$MAPE=\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\left|\\\\frac{{O}_{i}-{P}_{i}}{{O}_{i}}\\\\right|}{n} X 100$$(20)Coefficient of determination (R2)The coefficient of determination (R-squared) is basically “goodness of fit” and is the proportion of the fluctuations in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable. R2 values varyvary between 0 to 1, where 1 represents a perfect fit and 0 represents that the model fails.$${R}^{2}= {\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}({O}_{i} - \\\\overline{O })({P}_{i} - \\\\overline{P })}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{({O}_{i} - \\\\overline{O })}^{2}}\\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{({P}_{i} - \\\\overline{P })}^{2}}}\\\\right]}^{2}$$(21)where Oi is daily observed ET0 and Pi is daily estimated gridded ET0.Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE)The Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) is a normalized statistic that determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance (“noise”) compared to the measured data variance (“information”) (Nash and Sutcliffe 1970). The NSE varies between 1 (perfect fit) to -∞. The NSE less than 0 indicates that the mean value of observed time series data would have been a better predicator than the simulated model time series data.$$NSE=1- \\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\\\left({O}_{i} - {P}_{i} \\\\right)}^{2}}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\\\left({O}_{i} - \\\\overline{O }\\\\right)}^{2}}\\\\right]$$(22)where Oi is daily observed ET0 and Pi is daily estimated gridded ET0.Bias correctionIn this study, we utilized the simple and data-efficient linear bias correction statistical method. To accurately capture weather conditions and ET0, we computed a yearly scale factor (α) based on a time series of station-estimated ET0 and gridded-estimated ET0 data (Eq. 23). To overcome the limitations arising from limited data availability, we considered meteorological subdivisions, which group regions exhibiting similar weather patterns. For each subdivision, we determined a bias scale factor by leveraging ground station data. This approach effectively encompasses the wide spectrum of weather conditions and evapotranspiration patterns found across various subdivisions, despite the constraints posed by limited station data availability.$$Scaling\\\\;factor\\\\;\\\\left(\\\\alpha \\\\right)= \\\\frac{mean\\\\;observed}{mean\\\\;simulated}$$(23)Probability of Detection (POD)The performance diagram (Roebber 2009) is a valuable tool for comparing the probability of detection (POD) and success ratio (SR) between two datasets: estimated gridded ET0 and GLDAS model ET0. It utilizes a contingency table (Table 3) to assess hits, false alarms, misses, and missing rejections when comparing observed values to derived products. This diagram enables a comprehensive evaluation of these metrics, providing insights into the performance and agreement of the datasets. The comparison was conducted between the gridded estimated ET0, GLDAS ET0, and station-estimated ET0 for the period 2017–2018. ET0 values were categorized as low (0–5 mm), medium (5–10 mm), and high (10–15 mm), allowing for a thorough analysis of dataset performance within different ET0 ranges.Table 3 Contingency tableFull size table$$Probability\\\\;of\\\\;Detection\\\\;(POD)= \\\\frac{A}{A+C}$$(24)$$False\\\\;Alarm\\\\;Rate\\\\;(FAR)= \\\\frac{B}{A+B}$$(25)$$Success\\\\;Ratio\\\\;(SR)=1-FAR$$(26)Results and discussionsSpatiotemporal distribution of ET 0 over the Indian regionEvapotranspiration varies throughout the year in response to seasonal changes, as it is influenced by factors such as radiation and temperature.

Microwave remote sensing with its unique characteristics of high penetration and sensitivity towards dielectric constant, has enabled the researchers to explore various techniques for soil moisture estimation. With the launch of Sentinel-1 (A&B) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites, the hindrance in accessing high spatial and temporal resolution data is eliminated. The current study focuses on surface soil moisture estimation for bare agricultural fields in the semi-arid region. Field soil moisture up to 5 cm depth using HydraGo Probe sensor and surface roughness synchronizing with satellite pass dates were collected from total 102 locations spanning four dates. Volumetric and sensor-based soil moisture are well correlated with R2 = 0.85. The Modified Dubois Model (MDM) was applied to obtain the relative permittivity of the soil for the backscattering coefficient (σ◦) for VV polarization, which is used as one of the inputs in universal Topp’s model for soil moisture calculation. Model derived soil moisture is well correlated with ground-based soil moisture for the entire range of the soil moisture (0.02-0.18 m3m-3) with R2 = 0.85 and RMSE=0.005. The entire soil moisture was categorized in three soil moisture ranges to evaluate the sensitivity. The highest correlation was observed for 0.06-0.1 m3m-3 with R2 = 0.73 and RMSE=0.003 followed by 0.015-0.6 m3m-3 with R2 = 0.81 and RMSE=0.001 and 0.11-0.18 m3m-3 with R2 = 0.48 and RMSE=0.019 which is significantly low. Performance accuracy of MDM is encouraging for bare soil moisture estimation for even the lower range of surface soil moisture.ReferencesBaghdadi, N., Choker, M., Zribi, M., El Hajj, M., Paloscia, S., Verhoest, N.

An adequate amount of water (irrigation) is needed for healthy crops and to increase productivity. Water scarcity is a major problem the world faces, where agriculture consumes a significant portion of freshwater. Many researchers concentrate on imparting intelligence in irrigation systems using machine learning (ML) in recent days.

Cultivation of crops is mandatory for food production, the growth of the country’s economy, to enrich the beauty of the land, etc. Plants contribute to natural air purification. Most countries strive to protect and improve their green spaces. However, the issue stems from improper watering and adaptation to changing weather conditions. If plants are not appropriately irrigated, they cannot survive. While water scarcity is a problem that the world faces, a significant portion of freshwater is consumed by agriculture (Mancosu et al. 2015; Vanani et al. 2017). If water wastage could be controlled in agriculture, it is possible to save a substantial percentage of freshwater. Maintenance of soil moisture is essential for the uninterrupted growth of the plant. There are different methods used for irrigation, like sprinklers, drip irrigation, etc. The water should be given so that the plant gets an adequate amount of water for the uninterrupted growth and productivity of the crop. While maintaining soil moisture, moisture levels also are considered. It should not be overwatered or should not be underwater. Soil moisture also depends on the type of soil, humidity, rain, temperature, etc. (Mintz and Walker 1993; Ostad-Ali-Askari et al. 2017). In traditional irrigation systems, humans assess whether the moisture is enough and decide to irrigate the plant. But it will be advantageous to reduce human intervention in watering and monitoring with an automated system. Human labour can be reduced by establishing an automated intelligent irrigation system. The amount of water adequate for the plant can be determined by using an intelligent irrigation system and thus can reduce the wastage of water as well. For this, farmers can seek the help of modern technologies like sensors, the IoT, ML algorithms. These technologies can contribute to the automation and monitoring of crops without the use of extensive human resources.With the high usage of computers and smart devices, there exist systems for effective monitoring of crops. There have been studies on crop disease detection and management. When humans started to use modern machinery in agriculture and farming, their labor was reduced by a lot. Even though watering and care at the accurate time is a must in the growth of plants. Watering plants is a time-consuming process. If it could be automated with intelligence, then farmers could utilize their time for other farming activities. A traditional irrigation system does not have intelligence, which will cause wastage of water, or sometimes the plant may not get an adequate amount of water. An intelligent irrigation system can make decisions on its own about when to water and the amount of water required to water the crop (Nawandar and Satpute 2019; Ostad-Ali-Askari and Shayannejad 2020). This system can reduce overwatering and underwatering issues, resulting in fewer plant deaths, root rot issues, and plant drying issues.Drip irrigation is a water-saving system that slowly sprays water into the soil or plant roots. Plant diseases can be reduced by using this system. Drip irrigation is suitable for all types of soil. The problem with the system is the maintenance of the pipe from clogging. But that is not required at short intervals. With the developments in sensors, IoT and ML, it is possible to innovate a system that can automate and impart intelligence to irrigation in agriculture. The sensor can be used to check water moisture in the soil, temperature, humidity, etc. Climate, humidity, and soil temperature are all factors that influence soil moisture. This data can be used to prevent water wastage by calculating the optimum requirement for water. M2M allows devices to communicate with each other without human intervention. IoT consists of intelligent devices connected to the web. IoT uses embedded systems, such as processors, sensors, and communication hardware, to gather, transmit and act on data they obtain from their surroundings. These devices can send data from a sensor to another edge device or a gateway (Al-Fuqaha et al. 2015). ML programs are concerned with how to improve a model with experience automatically. ML algorithms can learn from data and make predictions based on that data.The first contribution of the paper is a detailed comparative review of state-of-the-art techniques in the last five years (2017–2021) for the automated intelligent irrigation system. The study is performed concerning mechanism used, advantages, disadvantages, ML algorithms used, dataset/data collection methodology, performance measures, and accuracy percentage. It provides a brief idea to a researcher about state-of-the-art techniques and research horizons in the intelligent irrigation system. The second significant contribution of the paper is the IoT-based intelligent irrigation system. In this paper, the research collected data such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture of the plant and online weather data and trained the models and used them to predict the soil moisture after a particular amount of time. This system is an automatic watering system that waters based on the plant’s water requirements, reducing human intervention and eliminating water waste and power consumption while ensuring continuous growth. The proposed research predicts the water requirements with regression models, K-nearest neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF). The experimentation shows that KNN and RF show the accuracy of prediction up to 0.996 (99.6%), which offers a good contribution to the agriculture field using Machine Learning algorithms. The proposed system is considered to be cost efficient as it won’t waster water as it will only water the plants when required. The system will also use less power since it is using drip irrigation, which is also controlled wastage of water. The motor won’t work to irrigate extra water and thus will save power. The sensors will also work in sleep and listen mode, which also helps in saving power. Thus, overall system will be cost efficient by reducing power requirement, human labour, and money in terms reducing water and power bills.The paper provides a detailed literature review of state-of-the-art working automated intelligent irrigation systems in the following section of this paper. Section 3 consists of the implementation and architecture of our system. Section 4 includes the proposed algorithms and ML algorithm, which is used in the current work. Section 5 discusses the obtained results, and Sect. 6 contains the conclusion and future work.2 Comparative review of state-of-the-artMany recent studies have been conducted on automated intelligent irrigation systems using different methodologies used. The section discusses major state-of-the-artwork from (2017–2021) in the automated intelligent irrigation system with comparative analysis. The comparative review of state-of-the-artwork is mentioned in Table 1.Table 1 Comparative review of state-of-the-art work in automated intelligent irrigation systemFull size tableIn the paper (Goldstein et al. 2018), they collected soil moisture from the plot and temperature data to forecast the irrigation plan for the upcoming week and construct an irrigation strategy weekly for plots, using ML algorithms. They used regression and classification models. Compared to the agronomist’s prediction, a linear regression model did not have a high success rate, but the regression tree model, known as gradient boosted regression trees (GBRT), resulted in 93% accuracy and boosted tree classifiers (BTC) resulted in 95% accuracy. GBRT is regarded as one of the most efficient and admired prediction models, with exceptionally high accuracy. But GBRT-based regression trees are challengeable to interpret since they include fifty decision trees.The work in Mota et al. (2018) discusses the problems faced by chestnut trees in the summer. These trees need optimum irrigation for fruit productivity. They found the relation between soil, tree, and water. They found that the photosynthetic productivity of chestnut trees is dependent on soil moisture. The data set used for the study are sensor data of soil moisture of both irrigated and non-irrigated trees, climate conditions, tree leaf and stem moisture data of both watered and not-watered trees. The regression model uses for the photosynthetic rate and mid-day stem water relationship.The paper (Goap et al. 2018) discusses soil moisture, soil temperature, air temperature, ultraviolet (UV) light radiation, and relative humidity of the crop field. The algorithm considers data from sensors and the weather forecast data for the near future to impart intelligence to the system. The paper points out the importance of weather forecasting in irrigation systems. Prediction of future Soil Moisture Differences (SMD) is made using a trained Support Vector Regression (SVR) model. The output value of SMD is provided as input to the k-means clustering to improve the prediction result of the difference in soil moisture. The soil moisture difference is taken as the centroid value of the k-means. The result of the k-means clustering is used to make the irrigation decision. A real-time monitor was implemented for irrigation management. The system will start and stop irrigation automatically by considering threshold values for starting and stopping. The algorithm has a 96% accuracy rate.This research (Ebin et al. 2019) developed an automated irrigation system that monitors past weather conditions, soil moisture, and current weather conditions. The system can reduce human intervention in agriculture by imparting proper irrigation methods using ML algorithms. The ID3 algorithm learns according to data from temperature sensors, soil moisture sensors, and light intensity sensors, in addition to weather data. The ID3 algorithm is resistant to outliers and missing values. Also, ID3 requires less cleaning of data than other algorithms. However, the performance of the external data is inadequate.The paper (Kondaveti et al. 2019) describes the contribution to protecting agriculture in urban areas by introducing an automated irrigation system. This algorithm uses a rainfall prediction algorithm to predict crops suitable for a specific location. They introduced Romyan’s method to determine when to switch on irrigation, thus reducing electricity and water usage. The paper gives a brief description of different types of soils and how they differ in retaining moisture. They use a linear regression model to predict rainfall using parameters mean temperature, max temperature, min temperature, mean humidity, sea level pressure, and wind speed. The rainfall prediction gives almost high accurate results but more complex for real-time implementations.The problems faced in the agriculture sector in the Jordan valley is discussed in Blasi et al. (2021). The research examines the artificial intelligence-based solution for a water irrigation system to solve the problem of the agriculture sector. Sensor data is used to construct the intelligent irrigation system using a traditional drip irrigation system with a pipe control mechanism and an ML algorithm for automation. Selected information (Soil Humidity, Soil Type, Soil Salinity, and Temperature) from the data set collected from the Directorate of Agriculture of the Southern Jordan Valley was analyzed using python programming. Data is pre-processed from numerical to categorical data to apply the decision tree (DT) algorithm. After training and testing, the data from sensors is used to determine the irrigation needs. Humidity levels and temperature also decide whether to stop or start irrigation. In this work, a high accuracy (97.86%) was achieved using the simple DT algorithm.The work done in Velmurugan (2020) is used to solve the water wastage in Indian agriculture and avoid unplanned water usage causes a decrease in ground-level water. This system uses data from the sensors and weather forecast data from the internet. The gateway collects sensor data and sends it to a base station. This data can be visualized and analyzed using server-side software.The paper (Shekhar et al. 2017) discusses traditional irrigation systems, ICT-based agricultural monitoring, the scope of machine learning in agriculture, and IoT based irrigation systems. Using an intelligent method, they are trying to irrigate by taking data like soil moisture and temperature to predict the soil type and turn on the water accordingly. The details of soil conditions and the amount of water irrigated are saved in the cloud and assessed by the farmer using his cell phone. The system uses an Arduino as a microcontroller and a Raspberry Pi3 as a processing unit. The KNN algorithm used for this work proposed to give higher accuracy.This study (AlZu’bi et al. 2019) uses the Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT) and ML algorithms to construct an intelligent irrigation system. This system can reduce water wastage with intelligence applied to the system. The system consists of a set of hardware units along with software programs. The Arduino MEGA 2560 is a microcontroller board to link sensor data. The ESP8266 chip is used to collect information from the microcontroller to the server. Soil moisture sensors, humidity, and temperature sensors are used to collect environmental data. To avoid water wastage during the rainy season, a raindrop sensor was added to the system. A relay is used to switch on and off the water pump. The Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) is used for classification. IP cameras have been used to capture soil cracks and the yellowing of leaves to add to the decision about watering, along with other sensor data. The classification algorithms used are SVM, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and RF. Precision in the NN is 0.96. SVM yields a score of 0.95. Recall for Neural Network was 0.80. When it comes to high accuracy, the Neural Network is the way to go. However, when it comes to training time, SVM is the best option.The paper (Mahajan et al. 2018) describes a prototype for an automated, IoT and ML-based irrigation system that uses sensor data. The irrigation is done by collecting sensor data such as moisture, temperature, age of the plant, type of the plant, soil, etc., of the plant. A gateway captures the sensor values and sends them to a Raspberry Pi control unit with KNN algorithm. Instead of scheduling the irrigation periodically, the system will predict the condition of the soil for watering based on sensor data and qualified data and apply the ML algorithm. They selected water scheduling parameters like temperature, soil CO2, and humidity sensor values. They used this dataset to implement the Multifractal Downscaling Model algorithm. This gives a novel approach by resolving heterogeneity in soil moisture.The contribution discussed in Nawandar and Satpute (2019) uses IoT and neural networks (NN) to develop a low-cost intelligent system for smart irrigation farming. To make decisions about future irrigation schedules using learning algorithms, ground surface evaporation, transpiration from leaves, stems, flowers, etc., is used. The experiment took user data as input for the estimation of the required amount of water. The planting area can be divided into zones according to the type of crop or moisture. The moisture sensor is placed in areas where the average humidity is present. If various modes of irrigation can be imparted, it will help when unpredictable weather changes occur. This drip irrigation system can save up to 67% of water by using the NN method.The work (Alipio et al. 2019) talks about site-specific farming. This method continuously monitors farm-specific soil or plants to enhance the agriculture process. The work integrates IoT, sensors, Data Analytics, and a Web interface. Sensors are integrated into hydroponic farms to monitor the parameters used for the hardware. The software includes a cloud server, analysis of data, and ML predictions. The application developed to control and monitor the farm parameters using sensors and actuators. The sensor values were collected and built into a Bayesian Network to classify and predict the ideal value of each actuator and autonomously control the hydroponic farm. The model achieves an accuracy of 84.40%. “ Think to Speak” IoT platform used for the dashboard. The problem with this kind of system is the high cost.Another study in Rawal (2017) uses a microcontroller ATMEGA328P on the Arduino platform as a control unit. They put a system that uses a GSM-GPRS SIM900A modem, and a web page was created to check the farmer’s sprinkler status. The GSM modem is used to transfer data obtained from sensors to the internet. They aim to avoid over-and under-watering the plant, using a little human intervention. The author used THINGSPEAK open data platform and API to analyze the data and automatically respond to sensor results. Thus, the sprinkler can be on and off until the desired moisture is obtained. Farmers can check the status and control the water by switching it on or off using an IoT-based system. In this work, no ML algorithm is applied to incorporate intelligence into the system.Due to water scarcity, farmers turn to groundwater resources, resulting in a reduction in ground-level water (Sidhartha et al. 2021). The lack of human labor for agriculture in cities highlights the need for an automated system. They made a computerized system using sensors that collected temperature, moisture, and humidity data. The system uses a DC-operated fan to manage the temperature. The Arduino gets the sensor data and decides to switch on or switch off the motor. To get the time RTC timer circuit connected with Arduino. The data is uploaded to a platform via XBee for real-time monitoring. This system is low-cost irrigation management. The drawback of this system is the lack of use of the ML algorithm to impart intelligence.This work (Ramya et al. 2020) consists of five stages: data acquisition, online weather data collection, soil prediction, real-time monitoring utilizing a web interface, and an IoT based motor controller. Soil moisture, humidity, temperature, and UV radiation are all published by the ESP32 node. Data collected using specific sensors, and a Raspberry Pi node collects data using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) cloud service. Sensor data, along with weather data from the farm location, is used to calculate the evapotranspiration rate using the Penman-Monteith model, contributing to the water consumption rate. It is kept on a server. Soil moisture is predicted using the Bagging ensemble learning model. They are using sensor data, weather data, and evapotranspiration rate. The idea of the Bagging ensemble model is different samples (with replacement) fit on several models of the dataset. Then, these models are added by applying the average, weighted average, or a voting system. A web interface is used to set the user’s required water threshold value and monitor real-time data. The Python code is used to start and stop the relay switch of the water pump automatically. Initially, the bagging algorithm was applied to differentiate between real and the predicted soil moisture, compared to the expected value using SVR and bagging methods. The results show the R2 value of the Bagging model is highest and the mean square error (MSE) of the Bagging model is more minor, while the R2 value of the SVR is less compared with the bagging model and the MSE of the SVR model is high.The detailed comparative review shows that automated intelligent irrigation system improve the performance of precision agriculture, but it is also necessary to improve the system in terms of cost (time and money), in order to reach the technology at grass-root level. There is also need to improve the mechanism in terms complexity of system, accuracy, and reducing training time of ML algorithms. The proposed work make a trial to develop cost-efficient automated intelligent irrigation system by considering water scarcity problem in UAE.3 Proposed system methodologyThe proposed system makes use of IoT and ML algorithms. This system will help reduce water wastage while providing irrigation for the flawless growth of the crop. The system will decide when to irrigate and switch on the motor pump automatically without human intervention by reducing human labor by watering.3.1 System architecture and workflowTo implement an intelligent irrigation system, first collected the temperature, soil moisture, and humidity data from the field using sensors. The proposed work exploits the DH11 sensor to collect temperature and humidity and the YL-69 sensor to collect real-time soil moisture from the field. Figure 1 shows overall architecture of system and the data flow, which is explained above.The ESP8266 microcontroller reads the data collected by the sensor. The collected data is sent to the Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP (LAMP) server using the Hypertext Transmission Protocol (HTTP) and the data is stored in a MariaDB database. At the same time, the microcontroller publishes the sensor data to the Mosquitto MQTT Broker. The Node-Red server is used to collect the real-time sensor data from the MQTT broker, and it was displayed on a dashboard on the server. This dashboard can be accessed via any smart device so that it is possible to monitor the real-time sensor data using a mobile phone or laptop. The collected real-time data is used to estimate the future soil moisture. This prediction utilizes online weather forecast data to get the maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and average temperature. The proposed work uses OpenWeatherMap API for collecting the forecast data.The trained ML model is used to predict the future soil moisture using the dataset. This predicted soil moisture value is used to determine whether the motor pump should be turned on. The water needed is calculated and the time to keep the motor on to pump the desired amount of water is determined. This information is sent to the ESP8266 microcontroller, and the microcontroller will send the signal to switch on the motor accordingly. Figure 2 shows the experimentation setup for the experiment. The experimentation is performed in controlled environment during month of March. The plant used during experimentation is Fenugreek plan, which is a fast growing plant. The plat is planted balcony of lab. The balcony roof was covered, so plant can get a controlled sunlight and the change in temperature and humidity outside will be same for the plant also. The collected information (temperature, humidity, and soil-moisture) on Node Red Server is visualized using simple user interface on mobile device. Figure 3 shows the dashboard view from mobile device before and after watering.Fig. 1Proposed system architecture and data flowFull size imageFig. 2Experimentation setup: a Circuit setup. b Over all experimentationFull size imageFig. 3Dashboard view: a Before watering. b After wateringFull size image3.2 Data collection and processingThe data is collected via sensors. A temperature-, humidity—and soil-moisture-sensors (DH11 sensor for temperature and humidity, YL69 for soil-moisture) are used to collect the data of the plant’s context. These collected data are sent to the server. The collected data is combined with the online weather forecast data of maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and average temperature to make a one record. Each field of the collected records is verified to ensure that all required values are collected and then inserted into the database. This data is collected every 5 min, and the soil moisture after 20 min from the point of data collection recorded. The data is collected for thirty days. The data collected via sensors and the online weather data is combined to create data-set for training ML model. The dataset includes:Current soil moisture data.Humidity.Current temperature.The maximum temperature of the dayMinimum temperature of the day.An average temperature of the day.Soil moisture (moisture after 20 min at the current time).The dataset is cleaned by eliminating rows that contains unknown values and only preserving valued datasets. The dataset consist of total 9000 records.3.3 Model selection architecture for soil moisture predictionsThe different ML models were used to select the best model for soil moisture prediction. The work used KNN for prediction in this project, which gives the best R2-value, MSE, and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) values compared to other experimented models. The current soil moisture data, humidity, current temperature, maximum temperature of the day, minimum temperature of the day, and an average temperature of the day are used as features to predict the Next soil moisture. The predicted soil moisture is used to switch off and switch on the motor pump and calculate the amount of water to be irrigated. The pump will be on till the calculated amount of water is pumped, and then it will go off. The user can monitor the plant’s current temperature, humidity, and soil moisture using his handset. This system can detect the remaining water in the tank using a water level detector and message the user about the water requirements. The user will not need to bother about the plant’s irrigation as the weather changes since the system automatically detects the water needs and serve the purpose accordingly.The automatic irrigation system needs to implement automatic prediction of soil moisture to calculate the crop’s water needs. This can be done with the help of ML algorithms. Since the value of soil moisture to be predicted is a continuous value, regression models are chosen to predict the soil moisture value. The different steps included in the prediction of soil moisture are depicted in Fig. 4. The created dataset of 9000 records is used for training ML models. The collected data is split for testing and training using the tarin_test_split function with random state 42 of the model selection package from the sklearn library. The dataset is split into 80% for training-data and 20% for testing-data. Using 80% of the training set, the model is trained with different ML models. The trained models are tested with the remaining test data set. The models were cross-validated for 10-folds to get a better validation score. In this paper, KNN is used for prediction and thus for decision making on automated watering, as it shows maximum accuracy after testing.Fig. 4Model selection architecture for soil moisture predictionFull size image4 AlgorithmThe Algorithm 1 for data collection is shown below, it is used to collect required data from sensors and weather data from weather forecast portal, and form the dataset for applying ML models. First, the data collected for current soil moisture (CSM), temperature (ST), and humidity (SH) from sensors are stored in structure record sensor data (SD) with Time. Similarly, MaxTemp (Maximum temperature), MinTemp (Minimum temperature) and AvgTemp (Average temperature) are collected from online weather forecast portal and stored in structure record weather forecast data (WD). The data from sensors and weather forecast portal is combined and stored in structure record collected data (CD) if none of the value from SD and WD is NULL. The data is collected after every 5 min and written to the database CD.A new column, “Next Soil Moisture” (NSM), is created from soil moisture value after 20 min. After data collection, the next step is to choose an ML algorithm to train and predict the soil moisture with the collected dataset. The ML algorithms considered are Regression models of KNN, Linear Regression (LR), SVM, and RF using Python.KNN is a method for classifying cases depending on their similarity to other cases. Cases that are close to each other are referred to as neighbours. KNN calculates the distance of unknown data for all cases, selects the k observations in the training data nearest to the unknown data point, and predicts the response using the most popular response value from their K nearest neighbours. The value of K is determined by a trial-and-error method. The Makowski distance is given by equation 1. Here, \\\\(x_i\\\\)’s are the input vectors and \\\\(y_i\\\\)’s are the output vectors and c is the content.$$\\\\begin{aligned} d\\\\left( x,y \\\\right) = \\\\left( \\\\sum _{i=1}^{n} |x_i - y_i|^{c}\\\\right) ^{\\\\frac{1}{c}} \\\\end{aligned}$$Next, another algorithm considered is the Multiple Linear Regression Algorithm to train the model. Multiple Linear Regression is an extension of Linear Regression. MLR is an arithmetic method that uses several independent variables to predict the consequence of a dependent variable. The calculation formula is given in equation 2.$$\\\\begin{aligned} y_i = \\\\beta _0 + \\\\beta _{1}x_{i1} + \\\\beta _{2}x_{i2} +... + \\\\beta _{p}x_{ip} + \\\\epsilon \\\\end{aligned}$$where for \\\\(i = n\\\\) observations, \\\\(y_i\\\\) = dependent variable, \\\\(\\\\beta _0\\\\) = y-intercept (a content term), \\\\(\\\\beta _i\\\\) = slope intercept for independent variables, \\\\(x_i\\\\) = independent variables, \\\\(\\\\epsilon\\\\) = residual term or error term for the model.Support Vector Machine is an important supervised learning algorithm. SVM works by choosing a hyperplane by increasing the distance from the closest instance of both classes to the hyperplane. The support vectors are a small subset of training data that are used to define the optimal hyperplane.$$\\\\begin{aligned} \\\\arg \\\\min _{w,b} \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left\\\\Vert {w} \\\\right\\\\Vert ^2 A = \\\\pi r^2 \\\\end{aligned}$$subject to$$\\\\begin{aligned} y_i\\\\left( w.x_i + b\\\\right) \\\\ge 1, i \\\\epsilon \\\\left[ 1,n\\\\right] \\\\end{aligned}$$The Random Forest Classifier is an ensemble classifier. The RF consists of many decision trees ', 'unique_identifier': 202}\n",

Impacts on existing activities for irrigation design and management systems are obvious due to the rapid change of climate system. This paper’s future focus is to evaluate the influence of the changing climate on the crop yield and irrigation requirement for the Wonji Shoa sugarcane plantation estate. For future climate data, it used the results of projections of the CORDEX regional climate model (RCM) with bias correction for medium concentration representative pathway 4.5 rcp and high concentration representative pathway 8.5 rcp scenario. The down-scaled data were then used as input to the AquaCrop model. The time series indicates a significant increasing trend in maximum and minimum temperature values and a slight increasing trend in precipitation for both 4.5 rcp and 8.5 rcp scenarios. The evapotranspiration shows an increase in 20.34%, 20.12%, 23.59%, and 24.36% for 8.5 rcp in the period of 2020s, 2040s, 2060s, and 2080s, respectively. For 4.5 rcp scenario, the change is about 8.4%, 11.65%, 13.22%, and 15.85% for the period of 2020s, 2040s, 2060s, and 2080s, respectively. The model output shows that there is an annual increase in yield. For 8.5 rcp scenarios, the incensement is 6.2%, 7.84, 11.03%, and 14.48% in the 2020s, 2040s, 2060s, and 2080s, respectively. For 4.5 rcp scenarios, the increment is much lower compared to 8.5 rcp scenarios. But there is still an increase in yield for 4.5 rcp. The change is 0.3%, 1.8%, 7.02%, and 4.82% for the period of 2020s, 2040s, 2060s, and 2080s, respectively.Similar content being viewed by othersClimate change and agriculture in South Asia: adaptation options in smallholder production systemsArticle Open access09 July 2019Climate change and variability in Kenya: a review of impacts on agriculture and food securityArticle 08 January 2020Climate-resilient strategies for sustainable management of water resources and agricultureArticle 07 June 2021Use our pre-submission checklistAvoid common mistakes on your manuscript.IntroductionThe global mean surface temperature changes for the period 2016–2035 relative to 1986–2005 will likely be in the range of 0.3 °C to 0.7 °C [1]. In Ethiopia, observations show a year-to-year variation for rainfall events all over the country [2]. While regional models predict an increase in rainfall, higher resolution analyses for Ethiopia suggest with spatial differences, there are both increases and decreases in the overall rainfall averages. The challenges faced by the agricultural sector under the climate change scenarios are to deliver food security for an increasing world population while protecting the environment and the functioning of its ecosystems. Climate change has become a significant threat to agriculture and food security across the globe. Projected changes in temperature, precipitation, and CO2 concentration are expected to significantly impact crop productivity [3]. Erratic temperature and precipitation conditions are shown to often occur concurrently, with dry growing seasons more likely to be hotter, have larger drought indices, and have larger vapor pressure deficits. This leads to the confluence of a variety of climate conditions that negatively impact crop yields [4].The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s [5] findings suggest that developing countries like Ethiopia will be more vulnerable to climate change due to their economic, climatic, and geographic settings. Climate change can affect multiple features of aquatic resources (e.g., quantity and quality, high and low flow extremes, timing of events, and water temperature). All these aspects affect livelihoods in the basin but have not received attention in planning for future water allocation and design of water infrastructures yet [6].Sugarcane (Saccharum spp. hybrids) is tropical grass broadly grown in both hemispheres in over 120 countries worldwide. It is an important agro-industrial cash crop, providing raw materials for different sugar industries, and plays a crucial role in the economy of several countries [7]. Ethiopia is among the countries which are struggling to cover their high demands for sugar all over the country and the world though we cannot cover even the country’s needs. Having the abovementioned and other related problems, it is imperative to understand the effect of upcoming climate variation on hydrometeorology and its subsequent influence on the lives of people and sugar products. This paper simulated the impacts of climate change on sugarcane in Wonji Shoa plantation using the AquaCrop model and a range of two projected downscaled climate scenarios, to estimate the likely future impacts on the crop in terms of yield and irrigation water requirement.MethodologyDescription of the Study AreaThe study area which is the Wonji Shoa sugar estate lies downstream of the Koka Dam in the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia in the Awash River Basin (Fig. 1), 110 km southeast of Addis Ababa and 10 km south of Adama by road approximately between 8°21′ to 8°29′ N and 39°12′ to 39°18′ E (Fig. 2) [8]. The estate (including out-growers) has a total area of about 8000 ha (excluding the current under expansion), and the factory has a total crushing capacity of 3500 TCD (ton of cane). Approximately 9319 households (6184 male-headed and 3135 female-headed) participate in the out-grower scheme. Each household possesses between 0.2 and 6 ha of land [9], and the out-growers supply 60% of the total sugarcane crushed per year.Fig. 1Location map of the study areaFull size imageFig. 2Observed and bias-corrected RCM monthly mean (A) Tmax, (B) Tmin, and (C) precipitation for baseline periodFull size imageThe Wonji Shoa irrigation scheme is found at an altitude of approximately 1500 m above sea level (m.a.s.l.). In the estate, generally, the slope of the farm is very gentle and regular.It has a semi-arid climate and obtains an average annual rainfall of 831.2 mm, highest daily evapotranspiration of 4.5 mm, and mean annual maximum and minimum temperatures of 27.6 °C and 15.2 °C, respectively. The soil of WSSE is mainly Andosols, Fluvisols, Leptosols, and Phaeozemes, according to the FAO soil classification.The main forms of land cover used in the Wonji Shoa irrigated land is perennial crop cover dominated by sugar cane plantation and uses high amount of water from the Awash River during the dry season of the year.Data collocationSources and Types of DataTo meet the objectives of this research, different types of data were collected from both primary and secondary data sources including satellite imagery and field data. Data collected included spatial data, hydrological data, and meteorological data.Meteorological DataMeteorological data was required since it will used as input to the Aqua crop model in the baseline scenario. The future metrological records which are already downscaled are available in different climate portals and used with bias correction. Based on these objectives, the meteorological data required for this study were collected from the Wonji Shoa sugarcane estate research center weather station, Ethiopian National Meteorological Services Agency (NMSA) at Addis Ababa. The daily meteorological data collected were precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and sunshine hours.Crop, Irrigation, and Soil DataThe crop, irrigation, and soil data are used in the Aqua crop model for simulation of the system (Wonji Shoa plantation state). The soils of WSSE are of alluvial-colluvial origin established under hot, tropical environments. Texturally, the soil can be categorized into light (course textured) and heavy (clayey black) soils. The estate sidetracked irrigation water from Awash River using centrifugal pumps and then to the masonry-lined main canal. Field water application is through a block-ended furrow irrigation system, and the excess water from the plantation fields is worn out through the network of surface drains. The main crops cultivated are sugarcane, haricot bean, and crotalaria. Sugarcane is planted at a rate of 16–18 t/ha in the estate, and it is cultivated as a perennial mono crop [2].Method of Analysis and ProceduresInvestigation of climate change’s impact on irrigation consists of the following steps:1.Using coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment over the African domain (CORDEX-Africa) with coupled model inter-comparison project phase 5 (CMIP5) simulations under representative concentration pathways (under the effect of increasing greenhouse gases) for Wonji Shoa plantation estate compatible with AquaCrop model and2.Use of AquaCrop model to simulate the effects of climate change on small-scale irrigation.Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX)Coupled Atmosphere–Ocean General Circulation Models (GCMs) are used for studying current and future climate globally, which simulate the climate of the Earth at the spatial determination of a few hundred kilometers. To detain the local impacts of topography and land surface features on climate and provide a better explanation of extreme events, limited-area regional climate models (RCMs) are used to downscale the GCM amount produced [10]. The Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) [10] is an initiative funded by the World Climate Research Program. The goal is to scheme a set of standardized research intended to scale back GCM predictions from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 (CMIP5) [5] in the widely held of the land areas of the world, both via RCMs and statistical techniques (dynamical and statistical downscaling, respectively).Future Climate Scenario DataThe climate scenario data used here are freely available data which is already downscaled and can be used directly by bias correcting for model output of Cordex of four scenarios, 2.5 rcp, 4.5 rcp, 6.5 rcp, and 8.5 rcp, produced by greenhouse gas, sulfate aerosol, and solar forcing and NCEP reanalysis data. The considered climate data are for medium and high (4.5 rcp and 8.5 rcp) scenarios of precipitation, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature.Bias Correction of the Row RCM DataClimate models often provide biased representations of observed time series, making correction procedures necessary [11]. Bias correction actions employ a transformation algorithm for correcting RCM output. The method used for bias correction of the study is the linear-scaling approach works with monthly correction values based on the changes between observed and present-day simulated values. Corrected RCM simulations will faultlessly agree in their monthly mean values with the observations. Precipitation is corrected with a factor based on the ratio of long-term monthly mean observed and control run data.$${p}_{cuntr}^{\\\\ast }(d)={P}_{cuntr}(d).\\\\left\\\\{\\\\left({p}_{obs}(d)\\\\right)/\\\\left({p}_{cuntr}(d)\\\\right)\\\\right\\\\}$$$${p}_{scen}^{\\\\ast }(d)={p}_{scen}(d).\\\\left\\\\{\\\\left({p}_{obs}(d)\\\\right)/\\\\left({p}_{cuntr}(d)\\\\right)\\\\right\\\\}$$$${T}_{cuntr}^{\\\\ast }(d)={T}_{cuntr}(d)+{\\\\mu}_m.\\\\left({T}_{obs}(d)\\\\right)-{\\\\mu}_m\\\\left({T}_{cuntr}(d)\\\\right)$$$${T}_{scen}^{\\\\ast }(d)={T}_{scen}(d)+{\\\\mu}_m.\\\\left({T}_{obs}(d)\\\\right)-{\\\\mu}_m\\\\left({T}_{cuntr}(d)\\\\right)$$where * is the final bias corrected, cuntr is the RCM simulated 1961–1990, μ is the monthly mean (location parameter of Gaussian distribution), and scen is the RCM-simulated 2005–2099.AquaCrop Model SimulationAquaCrop is the FAO crop model to simulate harvest reaction to water. It is intended to balance ease, accuracy, and robustness and is predominantly suited to address conditions where water is a key controlling element in crop production. The AquaCrop model requires inputs including climatic parameters, crop, soil, and field and irrigation management data. The model contains a complete set of input parameters that can be selected and adjusted for different soil or crop types. The system (the interaction between plant and soil) is also affected by management (field and irrigation) which is fertility, when and in what amount to apply irrigation water. The system links with the outside world which is an upper boundary. At the upper boundary, there are weather conditions which describe what is the rainfall, how much energy available to vaporize water, and what is the concentration of carbon dioxide. At the lower boundary, the ground water table is linked to the system in which water commences the system drain and the water table near the soil and subsoil and then water moves by capillary rise from the water table to the subsoil.Conditions in Upper BoundaryThe upper boundary is about the weather condition, and it consists of reference evapotranspiration, rainfall, minimum and maximum temperature, and annual CO2 concentration. Metrological data recorded in Wonji Shoa station is used to compute reference evapotranspiration (ETo), and it expresses the evaporating power of the atmosphere. It determines the rate of transpiration and evaporation in AquaCrop which can be calculated from metrological data. Next to ETo, AquaCrop requires minimum and maximum temperatures, and it is required to calculate growing degree days which determine the speed of crop development. For ETo, minimum and maximum temperatures can be entered daily, 10 daily, or monthly. However, AquaCrop will need to work and simulate in daily time steps. In the Wonji Shoa case, both baseline and future data (ETo, minimum and maximum temperatures, and rainfall) are in daily steps. AquaCrop also requires rainfall data to update daily water balance and to simulate water stress. Finally, AquaCrop needs mean annual CO2 concentration because it affects biomass-making and crop transpiration. It consists of recorded and projected (future) concentrations. The latter one is used for climate alteration scenarios.Climate FileAquaCrop contains a database in which climatic data is stored. On the one hand, we have the evaporating power of the atmosphere which is stored on the ETo file. We also have a Tnx file which contains minimum and maximum air temperatures. Next, we have Flu files which contain rainfall, and finally, we have CO2 file which contains long record mean annual CO2 concentration. These four files contain climatic data. Finally, there is a climate file which is a Cli file, and it does not contain any data but tells which is the Eto, Tnx, Plu, and CO2 files that are linked to that particular station. By means of CO2 files (estimated from the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC)), it enables testing the crop response under climate change scenarios. From dew point temperature, air humidity is usually obtained.Solar radiation (Rs) can be anticipated from difference between maximum temperature (Tmax) and minimum temperature (Tmin). It involves extraterrestrial radiation (Ra) for the certain location and time of the year that can be calculated by the following formula.$$Rs\\\\approx KRs\\\\sqrt{\\\\left({T}_{max}-{T}_{min}\\\\right)} Ra$$Wind speed is generally calculated at range of heights and has to be further transformed to a 2-m reference height. A measure of the evaporative pressure of the environment is known as ETo. It also decides both crop transpiration and soil evaporation rates. To determine ETo, AquaCrop requires station characteristics like latitude, altitude, and location. It can be calculated by means of a built-in ETo calculator Table 1.Table 1 Climatic data parameters required by AquaCropFull size tableSoil ProfileAquaCrop embraces physical as well as chemical parameters of the soil profile which are shown in Table 2. Sampling can be conducted from 120 cm soil depth (Vanuytrecht, Hsiao et al. 2014). Usually, soil profile study was allowed to demonstrate the soil characteristics at the experimental field and determine the analysis of physicochemical belongings. In this model, the condition of soil water in the lower, middle, and upper positions has been measured as the input of the AquaCrop model to predict the water use effectiveness of the sugarcane. Knowing soil physical characteristics (soil water content on SAT, FC, and PWP and hydraulic conductivity), by using that information, AquaCrop will drive other soil characteristics. These soil characteristics which obtained by using soil water content include TAW which determine the size of the soil reservoir in which water can be stored and REW which is readily evaporative water which is required to calculate soil evaporation and soil type. In the Wonji Shoa plantation, the whole soil’s physical characteristics come from the Wonji Shoa sugarcane estate research center.Table 2 Soil parametersFull size tableCropWhen we load crop file, AquaCrop load conservative parameters which are crop-specific do not change maternally with time, management practice, geographical location, climate, or cultivar. They are valid in all cultivars and environments. So, we do not need to calibrate and validate it. The parameters which need to be calibrated and validated are cultivar-specific, and the less conservative ones include field management, planting mode, condition in the soil, and climate. But nonconservative parameters are the parameters which are cultivator-specific and can be influenced by crop field rule, planting node, state of soil, etc.Parameters Affected by Field ManagementThe type of planting method may be direct sowing or transplanting. In Wonji Shoa plantation, transplanting is the method of planting.Plant density is important to calculate initial and canopy cover (cco˳) cc for canopy cover note for initial. The initial canopy cover is the moment of emergence. AquaCrop needs that for describing the canopy development in function time. ccocan be calculated as the plant density times the size of the canopy cover per seedling.For the time to 90% seedling emergence, we must specify the time since it is affected by field preparation, soil temperature, and soil water content. The time needed for 90% of seedlings of the Wonji Shoa case is about 3 months.Parameters Affected by Conditions in Soil ProfileMaximum rooting depth and the time to reach that depth are considered here. The rooting depth and the time to reach it are affected by soil’s physical and chemical characteristics such as temperature, mechanical impendence, aeration, pH, salinity, and high levels of aluminum and manganese. What we need to specify is the time to reach the maximum depth and the maximum rooting depth itself. AquaCrop uses the concept of effective rooting depth that is the soil depth where major crop water uptake takes place. The minimum effective rooting depth considered here is not zero, and it is about 0.2 or 0.3 m where the germinated seed can extract water. The effective rooting depth in Wonji Shoa plantation is 0.85–2 m, but when it has 5 routines, it sometimes reaches 3.2 m.Field ManagementAquaCrop simulates crop and soil interaction. Since it is affected by field management, it must be considered as well. There are parameters which vary with the type of field management. In AquaCrop, various types of field management are considered and include field surface practice, application of mulches, and effect of soil fertility.Field Surface PracticeThese are practices which used to reduce surface runoff. AquaCrop has methods to estimate surface runoff. Surface runoff is the part of rainfall that might be lost by surface run-off from the field and does not infiltrate. Surface runoff is simulated in AquaCrop by the curve number (CN) method from the SCS of the USDA. In AquaCrop, the infiltration rate is considered to calculate CN. The curve number is low for high infiltration rate. If the infiltration rate of the soil is low, the curve number will increase which will generate more runoff. Given the infiltration rate, AquaCrop will select the curve number, but that curve number varies with the condition of the topsoil.Determination of Net Irrigation Requirement (Inet)The resolution of net irrigation makes use of threshold. It is the allowable root zone depletion. When in the lack of rainfall, the irrigation volume drops below the allowable root zone; then, small amount of water will be injected into the root zone to keep the soil water content at that level for such day. Toward the end of the season, the sum of the added water is the net irrigation.$${\\\\textrm{I}}_{\\\\textrm{net}}=\\\\sum \\\\textrm{water}\\\\ \\\\textrm{added}$$These are net requirements because it does not consider extra water that has to be practical to the field to account for conveyance losses or the uneven distribution of irrigation water on the field. To run AquaCrop in the net irrigation mode, we need to specify the allowable root zone depletion which is expressed in a fraction of RAW (rarely available water). RAW is zero when the soil water content is in field capacity and 100% at the threshold for stomatal closure. So, the allowable root zone depletion is expressed in the percentage of RAW. The knowledge of the method is required because it determines which fraction of the soil surface is wetted. It is 40–60% in furrow, 30% in drip, and 100% in sprinkler and basin irrigation. In Wonji Shoa, the technique of irrigation is furrow.Condition in the Lower BoundaryThe lower boundary is all about the depth and the quality of the ground table. By knowing the depth of the ground table and its quality, AquaCrop can simulate the movement of water and salt from the groundwater to the root zone. The condition at the lower boundary can be constant or vary with time. The groundwater of WSSE is very shallow, experiencing great spatio-seasonal fluctuations and showing a rising trend. Such characteristics of GWTD are expected to negatively impact the socioeconomics and environment of the region, thus, a concern for the sustainability of the sugar estate. The mean average GWTD of the study area ranged between 0.2 and 2.0 m; thus, all plantation fields are classified to be shallow. The groundwater data of Wonji Shoa plantation used for Aqoacrop is a groundwater table with constant depth and salinity (1.5 m and 2.5 ds/m).Results and DiscussionClimate ProjectionThe projected climate result during the baseline and future period is described here. The result of downscaled RCM of more than 15 models for the 4.5 rcp (medium representative concentration pathway) and 8.5 rcp (high-representative concentration pathway) scenarios from 1990 to 2099 compared with the baseline (1990–2016) period data from Wonji Shoa sugar cane estate research center.Baseline ScenarioMaximum Temperature, Minimum Temperature, and PrecipitationThe monthly mean maximum, minimum temperature, and precipitation obtained from the RCM model (CORDEX) and with bias correcting give the following results for the baseline period (1990–2016) of both in 4.5 rcp and 8.5 rcp emission scenarios as shown in Fig. 3.Fig. 3Change in Tmin (2011–2099) at Wonji Shoa for both scenariosFull size imageThe monthly maximum and minimum temperatures for 4.5 and 8.5 rcp scenarios in the baseline period show a reasonably good agreement with the observed temperature for all months. Bias-corrected RCM model result performs reasonably well in estimating the mean monthly precipitation satisfactory given the fact that precipitation downscaling is necessarily more problematic than temperature.Downscaled RCM for Future ScenarioThe climate scenario result for the future period was developed from downscaled GCM for two representative concentration pathways (4.5 and 8.5 rcp) for 90 years, and the analysis was done based on four 20-year periods centered on the 2020s (2020–2039), 2040s (2040–2059), 2060s (2060–2079), and 2080s (2080–2099). All the comparisons in the following analysis were done with respect to the baseline period (1990–2016) data at Wonji Shoa research center.Maximum Temperature, Minimum Temperature, and PrecipitationThe downscaled minimum temperature shows an increasing trend for all months in all future time horizons for both 4.5 rcp and 8.5 scenarios. The average annual minimum temperature in the 2020s will be increased by 1.35 °C and 1.59 °C for 4.5 rcp and 8.5 rcp scenarios, respectively. For the 2040s periods, the average annual minimum temperature will be increased by 1.79 °C and 2.7 °C for 4.5 rcp and 8.5 rcp scenarios, respectively. For the 2060s periods, the average annual minimum temperature will be increased by 2.59 °C and 3.63 °C for 4.5 rcp and 8.5 rcp scenarios, respectively. For the late twenty-first century, the average annual minimum temperature will be increased by 2.79 °C and 4.09 °C for 4.5 rcp and 8.5 rcp scenarios, respectivelyFor Wonji Shoa, the overall analysis (2011–2099) of maximum temperature showed that there may be increasing trends in both scenarios (4.5 rcp and 8.5 rcp). The average annual maximum temperature in the 2020s will be increased by 1.21 °C and 1.16 °C for 4.5 rcp and 8.5 rcp scenarios, respectively. For the 2040s periods, the average annual maximum temperature will be increased by 1.48 °C and 1.93 °C for 4.5 rcp and 8.5 rcp scenarios, respectively. For the 2060s periods, the average annual maximum temperature will be increased by 1.52 °C and 2.98 °C for 4.5 rcp and 8.5 rcp scenarios, respectively. For the 2068s periods, the average annual maximum temperature will be increased by 1.97 °C and 4.17 °C for 4.5 rcp and 8.5 rcp scenarios, respectively. Increasing maximum temperature showed more variation at the monthly time step with arrange from 0.8 to 1.45 °C in 2020s, 1.01 to 2.6 °C in 2040s, 1.13 to 3.66 °C in 2060s, and 1.30 to 4.68°C in 2080s (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Change in Tmax (2011–2099) at Wonji Shoa for both scenariosFull size imageThe precipitation projection exhibited an increase in average mean precipitation in periods (2020s, 2040s, 2060s, and 2080s). As can be shown in Fig. 5, in all periods, there may be a decrease in precipitation for the months of May and September and an increase in all other months for both scenarios (4.5 rcp and 8.5 rcp). The overall effect in the 2020s may be an increase in average annual precipitation by 6.85 mm in the 4.5 rcp scenarios and 1.57 mm in the 8.5 rcp scenarios.Fig. 5Change in the mean of precipitation at Wonji Shoa for both scenariosFull size imageIn the 2080s, the overall effect may be an increase in average annual precipitation by 9.88 mm in the 4.5 scenario and 18.34 mm in the 8.5 scenario.AquaCrop Model ResultsCalibration and Uncertainty AnalysisCrop simulations were based on the cultivar N-14, which occupied 28 % of the sugarcane area at Wonji Shoa during the 2015/2016 season. Calibration of the model to this cultivar was done using the field data obtained in Wonji Shoa. Model performance was evaluated using the index of agreement, root mean square error (RMSE), and the coefficient of determination (R2)In AquaCrop calibration, the simulations performed focused on total biomass and yields. Through repeated simulation runs and output comparison (biomass and grain yields) of simulated versus observed yields, a set of values was arrived at for conservative parameters which seemed most appropriate and gave satisfactory results for the period of 1990–2006. For model validation, data from 2007 to 2016 were used. There was a good fit between the simulated aboveground biomass, and grain yield that agreed well with their corresponding observed data for all treatments during successful seasons had better fit (R2 = 0.89).Climate Change Impact on Sugarcane EvapotranspirationAquaCrop was produced by using downscaled climate data (Tmax and Tmin) and location (altitude, latitude) data of Wonji Shoa for future time. In the 2020s for the 4.5 rcp scenario, the Eto show an increase of about 121.13 mm and for 8.5 rcp scenarios by 293.08 mm. In the period of 2040s, the same trend continues an increase in 4.5 rcp by 168.24 mm and, for 8.5 rcp, an increase up to 390.08 mm is observed. In the 2060s for both scenarios, there is an increase in Eto by 190.3 mm for 4.5 rcp and 448.3 mm 8.5 rcp, respectively. In the 2080s, an increase of Eto is there for both scenarios having the value of 228.44 mm and 461.3 mm, respectively (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Average mean change of Eto for (A) 4.5 rcp scenario and (B) 8.5 rcp scenarioFull size imageClimate Change Impact on Sugarcane Irrigation RequirementFor the irrigated sugarcane crop, the climate impact on irrigation amounts was assessed, assuming the same future yields. To meet that yield, the assigned water for production gives us the clue about irrigation requirements. The difference in irrigation application between the baseline scenario and the future with the same yield is present here. In the 2020s for the 4.5 rcp scenario, the irrigation requirement shows any decreasing or increasing trends for successive four benchmarks. For 8.5 rcp scenarios, irrigation requirements show a decrease starting from the 2060s. In the 2060s, the requirement decreases by 5.22 mm, and in the 2080s, decreasing of irrigation requirement reached a value of 62.4mm.Climate Change Impact on Sugarcane YieldsClimate change impact on sugarcane yield was analyzed by comparing baseline yield and future yield for the 2020s, 2040s, 2060s, and 2080s. In the 2020s, for both scenarios, the yield showed an increase of about 2.80 ton/ha and 3.12 ton/ha for 8.5 rcp, respectively. In the period of the 2040s, the same trend continues, increasing in 4.5 rcp by 2.96 ton/ha, and, for 8.5 rcp, up to 3.13 ton/ha is observed. In the 2060s, there is an increase in yield both for 4.5 rcp and 8.5 rcp by 3.11 ton/ha and 3.22 tons/ha, respectively. In the 2080s, an increase in yield is there for both scenarios having the value of 3.02 ton/ha and 3.32 ton/ha, respectively.Climate Change Impact on Sugarcane BiomassClimate change impact on sugarcane biomass was analyzed by comparing baseline biomass and future biomass yield for the 2020s, 2040s, 2060s, and 2080s. In the 2020s for the 4.5 rcp scenario, the biomass shows an increase of about 14.01 ton/ha and for 8.5 rcp scenarios by 15.60 ton/ha. In the period of 2040s, the same trend continues in 4.5 rcp by 14.77 ton/ha and, for 8.5 rcp, up to 15.3 ton/ha is observed. In the 2060s also for both scenarios, there is an increase in biomass production for 4.5 rcp by 15.56 ton/ha and 8.5 rcp by 16.13 tons/ha, respectively. In the 2080s, an increase in biomass production is there for both scenarios having the value of 15.3 ton/ha and 16.61 ton/ha, respectively.Uncertainties in the StudyThere are various sources of uncertainties in climate change impact assessment works. The uncertainties for this study result from GCM outputs and problem related to AquaCrop model development. Unavoidably, the approach developed in this study which has linked climate scenarios and crop modeling has limitations. This study does not consider the possibility of future change in daily rainfall distribution within the seasons or changes in the frequency of extreme events such as droughts, heat waves, or cloudiness, which could substantially change the results discussed here. Climate scenarios have many uncertainties including that, in the future projections of climate generally stem from uncertainties in defining the factors (e.g., population growth, economic growth and development, energy use, control measures, transfer of clean technology to developing countries) that affect future emissions scenarios. Converting these emissions to atmospheric concentrations of the relevant greenhouse gases is also problematic.Any or all of the above uncertain', 'unique_identifier': 205}\n",

In areas like Egypt, located in an arid/semiarid region, where vegetation water requirement represents an important fraction of the total water consumption, the pressure of population growth and increasing domestic demand and other sectors for water represent other challenges for the agricultural sector. Agricultural activity in Egypt consumes from 80 to 85% of water resources. To meet these challenges, good water governance, which aims to reduce losses and increase benefits per unit of water, should be adopted. One of the most important ways to improve water use efficiency and optimize plant production is to provide crops only with the water they need based on the climate-plant-soil relationship.There are many ways to increase water use efficiency, such as improving irrigation canals in old land to increase the conveyance efficiency; using a pressurized irrigation system in new reclaimed lands, in addition to water management practices on farm like laser land leveling; using the raised bed irrigation method, irrigation scheduling, intercropping, crop intensification, and mulching; using soil amendments and organic fertilizers; and using short and drought tolerance varieties. The integrated management for soil, water, and crops is very important to maximize crop yield and water productivity, so in this chapter, the author will provide an overview on how to maximize crop yield with minimal water use.KeywordsEgyptIrrigation efficiencyWater managementWater requirements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccess provided by University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\\n                    \\n                            \\nDownload chapter PDF\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1 IntroductionDue to the growing and more affluent population, over the coming decades, the agricultural product demand will increase rapidly, with serious implications for the demand for agricultural water. Symptoms of the scarcity of water are increasingly apparent, threatening food production sustainability and ecosystem services. Improving water productivity will shrink the extra water requirements in agriculture [1]. Improving water productivity in rain-fed and irrigated agriculture decreases the need for extra water and is thus a critical reaction to growing water scarcity [2].Egypt is located in North Africa in an arid and semiarid region. Water resources are limited, and the Nile River is the main source of freshwater. Egypt’s population is growing rapidly, so the per capita water availability is continually decreasing. However, food production and industrial activities and productions should increase; therefore, water demand is expected to continuously increase for agriculture, industrial, and domestic sectors. Egypt is one of the most vulnerable countries to the impact of projected climate change [3]. This will cause more pressure on water resources to meet expected increases in crop water requirements, in addition to the new areas of agricultural production that is expected to continue to grow. Implications could include a reduction in crop yields. All of these challenges lead scientists and policymakers to search about how to maximize irrigation efficiency.Agriculture plays a vital role in Egypt’s economy contributing to about 15% of the gross domestic product and employing about 30% of the national workforce [4]. Over 95% of Egyptian agricultural land lies within the Nile Valley and Delta. There are three cropping seasons in Egypt, the summer season (April to October) and late summer season (July until October) and the winter season commencing from November to May. The main summer crops are cotton, maize, and rice, and the dominant winter crops are wheat, sugar beet, berseem (Egyptian clover), and broad beans. In addition, vegetable crops such as potato, tomato, and others are cultivated in all seasons. Sugarcane is growing mainly in Upper Egypt, while rice cultivates in the North Nile Delta. There are several areas in the West and East Delta which grow fruits and medical and aromatic plants.2 Water Resources and Usage in Egypt2.1 Water ResourcesWater resources in Egypt are limited as follows [5]:\\n\\nNile River is the main source of water in Egypt. The Nile water comes from outside Egypt’s borders; Egypt’s per share according to the Nile water agreement with Sudan allocates 55.5\\xa0billion cubic meters (BCM)/year to Egypt.\\n\\n\\nRainfall in Egypt happens only in the winter season as scattered showers. The effectively annual average amount of rainfall water is estimated to be 1.3 BCM/year. Due to the high temporal and spatial variability of the rainfall, this amount cannot be considered a reliable source of water.\\n\\n\\nGroundwater exists in the Sinai and the Western Desert aquifers that are generally deep and nonrenewable. The total amount of groundwater has been estimated to be about 40,000\\xa0BCM. However, the current extraction is estimated to be only 2.0\\xa0BCM/year. This may be due to the great depth of these aquifers up to 1,500\\xa0m and degradation of water quality at increasing depths.\\n\\n\\nShallow groundwater in the Nile aquifer cannot be considered as a distinct source of water. Seepage losses from irrigation and drainage canals and the Nile and percolation losses from irrigated lands are the source of recharging this aquifer. This water must not be added to Egypt’s water resources. Therefore, it is considered as a reservoir in the Nile River system with a huge capacity but rechargeable live storage of only 7.5\\xa0BCM/year. The current suction from this aquifer was estimated at 6.5\\xa0BCM in 2013.\\n\\n\\nDesalination of seawater in Egypt has been given little priority as a water resource due to the high cost of the treatment compared to other sources. There are several desalination practices on the coast of the Red Sea area to supply resorts and tourist villages with adequate clean water. Other desalination units of groundwater have been constructed at numerous locations in Sinai as a water source for Bedouins.\\n\\n\\nTreated domestic sewage is being reused as a source of irrigation with or without mixed freshwater. The total quantity of reused treated wastewater in Egypt was estimated to be 0.3\\xa0BCM in 2013.\\n\\n\\nReuse of nonconventional water sources such as treated sewage water and agricultural drainage water cannot be added to Egypt’s freshwater resources. Using these sources is a recycling process of the fresh Nile water which has been previously used. The total amount of reused water was about 13\\xa0BCM in 2013. The reuse practices increased the overall system efficiency as comparable to the efficiency of new irrigation systems.\\n\\n2.2 Sectoral Water DemandDue to a rapid increase in population and improving living standards as well as the industrialization policy encouraged by the government, water requirements in Egypt are increasing continuously. Water demand can be characterized in classes representing the major items on the demand side of the water balance according to [5] as the following:\\n\\nThe agriculture sector represents the largest consumer of water resources; it consumes more than 85% of Egypt’s per share of Nile water yearly.\\n\\n\\nMunicipal water requirements include water needs for major urban and rural villages. Municipal water demand was estimated to be 10\\xa0BCM in 2013. Municipal water production is diverted from two sources, surface water and groundwater, which represent about 83% and 17%, respectively, of total municipal water demand.\\n\\n\\nThe industrial sector is vital to social and economic progress. The water requirement for the industrial sector was 2.50\\xa0BCM/year during the year 2013.\\n\\nIn summary, there exists a 20\\xa0BCM/year gap between the availability and the demand for water. This gap is overcome by water recycling. The overall efficiency of the Nile system in Egypt is about 75%. By the year 2020, water requirements are expected to increase by 20% (15\\xa0BCM/year) [5]. The main consumer of freshwater is irrigated agriculture. Globally, irrigated land contributes to more than 40% from food production [6]. Water availability is a major challenge facing agricultural sustainable development in Egypt. Water resources in Egypt are highly limited [7]. Renewable water resources are estimated at 57.3\\xa0BCM/year, almost 97% of which originates from the Nile River [8].3 Water Scarcity in EgyptFreshwater is an increasingly limited resource [9]. As world population increases and standard of living is improved, the water need is expected to increase. Huge areas worldwide will suffer from water scarcity during the growing seasons, and natural environments may be affected [10]. The available per capita of freshwater in Egypt has fallen from 1,893\\xa0m3 in 1959 to 900–950\\xa0m3 in 2000 [11]. Further, the average per capita of the available water in Egypt reached about 710\\xa0cm3 in 2014, and it is expected to reach to about 350\\xa0cm3 by 2050 [12]. In Egypt, the water shortage amounts to 13.5\\xa0BCM/year and is expected to increase continuously. This water shortage is remunerated by using drainage reuse which subsequently declines water quality. By 2025 the water shortage is expected to be 26\\xa0BCM/year in the case of using the same current policies [13].The economic and political factors are the major driving forces to water scarcity in Egypt, in addition to the population growth, physical variables (land expansion and water resources), and social factors (quality of life, poverty, crop pattern, consumer’s behavior, and imbalanced distribution of water) [14]. Rapid population increase, increased urbanization, food security concerns, and the expected potential climate change impacts are increasing the attention given to more efficient and sustainable water management in Egypt [15]. The major challenge facing water resources in Egypt is the limited availability of supply resources. There are many challenges found on the demand side, such as water surface evaporation loss, seepage losses, evaporation losses, and infiltration losses from aquatic weeds in canals and agricultural lands, as well as imperfection in control gates, the efficiency of water distribution operation, expansion of agricultural lands such as sugarcane and rice areas, and extra pumping rates from wells and lack of extraction control in deep groundwater, use of sprinkler irrigation, damages in drip irrigation systems, low distribution efficiency in drinking water network, and weak public awareness in domestic water division [13].4 Crop Water Requirements and Irrigation Efficiencies in EgyptWater requirements for various crops depend mainly on evapotranspiration which is affected by weather parameters, management, and environmental factors. Also water requirements for the same crop differ from one place to another depending on the agro-metrological zone, irrigation system, variety, and management. Data in Tables 1, 2, and 3 represent the optimum water requirements as m3/feddan for winter, summer, and nili (late summer) crops, respectively, which are grown in the main three regions in Egypt (Delta, Middle Egypt, and Upper Egypt) under surface irrigation. Application efficiency reached 80% at farm level according to [16].Table 1 The optimum water requirements for winter crops (m3/feddan) at farm level of the main three regions in Egypt on 2016 [16]Full size tableTable 2 The optimum water requirements for summer crops (m3/feddan) at farm level of the main three regions in Egypt on 2016 [16]Full size tableTable 3 The optimum water requirements for nili crops and fruits (m3/feddan) at farm level of the main three regions in Egypt on 2016 [16]Full size table\\nIrrigation efficiency mentions to the amount of water removed from the source of the water that is used by the crop. This value is determined by water distribution characteristics, management of irrigation system, crop water use rates, and soil and weather conditions. Ideal water efficiency for crop irrigation means reducing losses in evaporation, runoff, or subsurface drainage and however increasing production [17].Utilization efficiency for water resources in Egypt is very low. Large amounts of irrigation water are being lost during water transmission from Aswan High Dam to fields. The recorded data indicated that the irrigation water at the Aswan Dam has increased by about 20% from 2000 to 2009. However, the losses during the transferring irrigation water from Aswan High Dam to fields due to evaporation and transpiration have increased by 30.90% and 35.46% in 1985 and 2005, respectively, and reached 33% in 2010. The efficiency of the field irrigation system is about 50% [18].5 Sustainable Water Use and Management to Cope with Water ScarcityIn order to secure the stability of food production globally under climate change condition [19], increasing water use efficiency in agricultural systems is very important for agricultural production, industrial and municipal purposes, and ecosystem health. Egypt can utilize the available quantity of water resources through expansion of less-water-consuming crops and reducing areas of high-water-consuming crops like rice and sugarcane, as well as enhancing the water supply system efficiency by detecting leakages, improving irrigation conveyance and distribution efficiency, and, in addition, introducing water conservation tariffs which might contain several kinds of crop or land taxes, water pricing, production charges, or subsidies for conservation of water and introducing public awareness for the society of a new water culture based on conservation principles [14]. The Egyptian national food security strategy is influenced particularly by growing cash crops on new lands, decreasing the areas of sugarcane and rice, increasing the cereal production on old lands, and giving attention to positive effects of the market-oriented economy [20].Strategies for water saving in agriculture do not only include irrigation practices, but they extend into the other areas affecting on-farm water application including cultivation methods, varieties, and benefits of land leveling [21, 22]. Other water-saving strategies include covering canals with effective reaches, the timing of land irrigation, removing aquatic weeds in water passes, and turning sugarcane areas to beet in old lands. In addition, suitable pumping rates from deep groundwater aquifers using high-efficiency irrigation systems like sprinkler and drip irrigation systems in newly reclaimed lands were suggested as proposed planning alternatives which would completely eliminate Egypt’s water shortage in 2025 [13].There are many strategies to sustain water use and management in the agriculture sector to reduce water scarcity. These strategies are related to irrigation system management, farm practices, and breeding programs.5.1 Increasing Irrigation Efficiency on Mesqa and Marwa level in Old LandsThe irrigation system in Egypt starts from the Aswan High Dam to the confluence of the two river branches Rosetta and Damietta with the Mediterranean Sea. It is a very complicated system; water passes many and through principle canals, main canals, branch canals, tertiary canals called Mesqa, and a field ditch that is called Marwa. The overall irrigation efficiency in Egypt is very low about 40–60%, due to evaporation, seepage, deep percolation, and transpiration from aquatic crops in irrigation canals. The cultivated area in Egypt is only 7.9\\xa0million feddan, about 3.3% from the total land area. This area is distributed as 9% oases and deserts, 12% new lands, and 79% old lands. The irrigation efficiency in the old land which has the main cultivated area in Egypt is about 40–60%. Thus, it is essential to improve the irrigation system and hence efficiency in the old land [23]. Several changes have the potential to reduce surface evaporation from free water, seepage, and aquatic weeds so irrigation efficiency increases such as changing earth field ditches called Mesqas to canals or pipelines, changing water abstraction from multi-point in the Mesqa to one point in the top end of the raised Mesqa, and changing the control from upstream to downstream [14].Rice yield increased by 11.4% under Mesqa improvement. This increase is due to good water availability by the equity distributing between the tail and head of the Mesqa. The irrigation water applied was decreased as mean of 15.55% and water use efficiency was increased [24]. The Irrigation Improvement Project (IIP) was one of the main irrigation projects for using modern methods in land networks and on-farm development. Land leveling/tillage and rehabilitation of main and branch canals especially Mesqas (replace earth Mesqa with pipeline) were included. This promotes cooperation between the irrigation directorate and farmers by forming water user associations in irrigation distribution management [25]. Integrated Irrigation Improvement and Management Project (IIIMP) is expected to achieve additional positive effects on water distribution, quality, quantity, equity, timeliness, and water savings by replacing earth Marwa with pipeline and other technical assistance required for establishing water boards and water user associations [26]. Under the World Bank-funded IIP from 1996 to 2006 and IIIMP, the main objective of the two projects is improving the management of irrigation and drainage in the Nile Delta of Egypt. The specific objectives of the irrigation modernization are to enhance equitable water distribution, water quality, and water use efficiency and ultimately to increase agricultural production and decrease poverty. Irrigation improvements under the IIP have taken place at the Mesqa level, Mesqa for the tertiary level of irrigation canals, while IIIMP has taken place at the Marwa level, the term Marwa is used for the infrastructure at farm levels. Modernization of the Marwas under IIIMP is ongoing currently at selected areas. Seepage losses from the Mesqas are reduced by the piping of the tertiary canals, in addition allowing for pressurized water delivery. Similar improvements have newly been made to selected Marwas under IIIMP [27].5.2 Using Pressurized Irrigation System in Newly Reclaimed LandsUsing modern irrigation system such as sprinkler and drip irrigation system in newly reclaimed lands is one of the most common strategies to cope with water scarcity in Egypt, because these systems save irrigation water and maximize efficiency. Moreover, these techniques can help overcome unsuitable soil, topography, climate, and water quality conditions. Drip irrigation is the best irrigation system when using saline water because it causes the highest irrigation application efficiency. Moreover, it causes less salt accumulation in the soil, prevention of leaf burn, and short irrigation frequency which prevents the soil from drying. Also, it helps to avoid higher peaks in salt concentration through continuous leaching of salts away from the wetted area accumulating at the wetting edges away from the active root zone [28]. Drip irrigation saves about 30–50% of irrigation water compared to surface irrigation, moreover reduces waterlogging and salinization, and achieves irrigation efficiency up to 95% [29].Irrigation application efficiency can be designed as 60%, 75%, and 90% for surface (border, basin, and furrow), sprinkler, and drip irrigation, respectively [30]. Using drip and sprinkler irrigation systems in the newly reclaimed land in the desert is required, and it is prohibited to use flood irrigation in these places because of the high permeability of these soils and low water holding capacity [14]. Sprinkler irrigation saves water, time, and financial costs and can provide additional income generation [31]. Drip irrigation could be used as a possible solution for the problems of water scarcity [32].5.3 On-Farm Water Management Practices to Maximize Water ProductivityMany agricultural practices on farm level could be applied in Egypt and could enhance productivity by implementing the following:\\n\\nLaser land leveling is a very important practice to enhance water use efficiency and rationalize irrigation water through decreasing losses such as runoff and deep percolation, especially for high-water-consuming crop such as rice and sugarcane. Land leveling prevents water logging and water stress, and also it reduces water runoff, so the application uniformity is enhanced which thus contributes to increased crop production [33]. Laser land leveling reduces deep percolation and runoff by 8% and 24%, respectively, compared to non-leveled fields in Tajikistan [34]. Land leveling has a positive influence on the reduction of water applied because it minimizes surface runoff especially of the highest-water-consuming crops like sugarcane and rice [14]. Mechanization management in soil preparation and laser leveling with transplanting could decrease irrigation water applied for rice by 29% and increase water use efficiency [35].\\n\\n\\nRaised beds is one of planting methods as another on-farm practice that is effective to save irrigation water. Raised beds were originally used in row crops, but nowadays there are many researchers that have indicated the importance of this planting method to apply on non-row crops like rice, clover (berseem), and wheat. Growing berseem on raised seed beds is a successful practice to save irrigation water by 18% and, moreover, increase fresh and dry yield from 20 to 26% and 23 to 28%, respectively, compared to the traditional growing on flat soil [36]. Raised bed planting method with deficit irrigation saved about 1,600 and 1,500\\xa0m3\\xa0water/ha and increased water productivity by 30 and 45% for maize and wheat, respectively, compared to farmers' practice with full irrigation practice [37]. Transplanting rice in bottom of beds can save a large amount of irrigation water ranging from 27 to 38% and increased irrigation water productivity by 56–66% without yield reduction or even slight yield increase [38,39,40].\\n\\n\\nAlternate furrow irrigation is one of the most applicable on-farm practices to reduce irrigation water applied and irrigation costs and increase crop yield, so it improves water productivity. Corn yield increased and irrigation efficiency improved with applied alternate furrow irrigation practice [41,42,43]. Alternative furrow irrigation technique saved about 22% and 42% from applied irrigation water compared to irrigating each furrow and basin irrigation, respectively, for cotton plants. This technique can increase water productivity without any yield reduction [44]. Alternative furrow irrigation can save about 30% compared to traditional furrow irrigation, in addition to slight increased on cotton yield [45].\\n\\n\\nAlternative root drying or partial root-zone drying can save a considerable amount of irrigation water especially for vegetables and fruit plants under drip irrigation system. This practice increased water use efficiency by 40% and increased yield by 43% per vine of wine grapes compared to traditional drip system [46]. Partial root-zone drying enhances irrigation water with respect to controls [47]. Applying alternative root drying strategies for potatoes and tomatoes could save 20–30% of irrigation water compared to fully irrigated plants. This technique increases significantly the potatoes marketable yield by 15% due to better size distribution [48].\\n\\n\\nDeficit irrigation, that is irrigated plants with amounts of water less than that required for full irrigation without any reduction in crop yield. Deficit irrigation allows for better water use efficiency compared to full irrigation, as presented experimentally for many crops [49, 50]. Also water-saving strategies can be used such as regulated deficit irrigation, that is, to irrigate in drought-sensitive stages of growth with minimum amounts of irrigation water [19].\\n\\n\\nSurge irrigation is applied as cycles of on and off from the stream which is delivered to the head of furrows. This technique saves a large amount of irrigation water and improves irrigation water productivity [51, 52]. In Egypt this technique is very important to maximize water productivity especially in heavy clay soils. On and off cycles give an appropriate chance to close soil cracks and decrease deep percolation. Surge irrigation practice reduces the irrigation water necessary during application by 14.5% and 18.6% for wheat and maize, respectively, while yield increased by 7% and 7.87% for wheat and maize, respectively [53]. Irrigation efficiency increased by 11.66% and 28.37% for the cutback and surge irrigation methods, respectively [32].\\n\\n\\nSchedule irrigation is applying a metric that identifies when to irrigate and by how much. It is very important to know the accurate crop water requirement depending on crop stages. Schedule irrigation leads to enhancing water use through decrease on on-farm water losses due to evaporation and can enhance crop yield.\\n\\n\\nNighttime irrigation is important to improve water productivity through reducing evaporation during daytime hours and produce healthy plants. Farmers should irrigate crops at night, because it reduces losses of evaporation which are carried out during sunlight and tail end losses to drainage system if there is no abstraction of freshwater during night time [14].\\n\\n\\nSupplemental irrigation is one of the important strategies that is used in arid areas through applying small amounts of irrigation water to winter crops that are normally grown under rain-fed conditions [54]. Many of the agronomic practices for improving the efficiency of water use rain-fed systems and depend on reducing water losses by runoff, soil evaporation, deep percolation, and competing weeds. Supplemental irrigation technique is used to overcome periods of low rainfall or high temperatures, and it is suggested to improve crop production [19].\\n\\n5.4 Sustainable Use of GroundwaterAccording to MWRI [5], extraction from deep groundwater aquifers in Sinai and the Western Desert is estimated to be only 2.0\\xa0BCM/year and 6.5\\xa0BCM in 2013 from shallow groundwater in the Nile aquifers.The quality of the groundwater in the Nile areas especially in North Nile Delta is expected to be affected strongly by the impact of sea level rise combined with changes of Nile River flows, which will lead to an increase in the salinity levels of the groundwater [55]. In addition, current and future human activities, especially extensive and unplanned groundwater abstraction, are resulting in degradation of the availability of groundwater resources. Serious negative socioeconomic impacts can follow as a consequence. In the Nile Delta, extensive groundwater abstraction is also a very significant factor that increases seawater intrusion, and groundwater wells which were beyond salinization zones in the past are consequently showing upcoming of saline or brackish water [56].There is a gap in information and implementation of groundwater resources development sustainability and protection of the environment in Nile Delta as a regional strategy. In addition, there is deficit knowledge about groundwater quality deterioration [57]. So, detailed studies should be applied to include all groundwater resources and data on quality deterioration in the Nile Delta aquifers, as well as hydrological studies of all groundwater resource aquifers in whole Egypt including Sinai and the Western Desert to define the available quantities and the secure yield of abstraction for sustainable use.5.5 Reuse of Drainage WaterThe importance of using nonconventional water resources like the reuse of drainage water, treated wastewater, and desalination of brackish and seawater are becoming increasingly important around the world particularly in water-scarce areas. Optimization of the use of water resources in Egypt is implemented via recycling industrial and domestic wastewater, reuse of drainage water, and desalination [14]. The reuse of agricultural drainage water in Egypt is considered as an integral addition to the water sources. Pumping stations of the government and farmers’ small diesel pumps extract water from drainage ditches and put it directly in the irrigation canals to reuse in agriculture irrigation; these actions have increased the country’s water resources by 20% [58]. Water shortage in Egypt is 13.5\\xa0BCM/year and it expected to increase continuously. This water shortage is compensated by the reuse of drainage which deteriorates the water quality [13].5.6 Modification of Cropping PatternUsing the optimum cropping pattern which achieves the maximum water return from the unit of water, it is a main factor to cope water scarcity in Egypt. Moreover it should have priority in the next years especially cropping patterns which save irrigation water. Expansion of less-water-consuming crops and reducing areas of high-water-consuming crops like rice and sugarcane is one of the encouraged strategies to cope with water scarcity in Egypt [14]. The main problem for water distribution engineers in Egypt lie in the free cropping pattern. These difficulties resulted from the randomized distribution of crop along the network canals, with their different areas [7].Planting drought- and salt-tolerant crop species as amaranth, Andean lupin, and quinoa may result in more resilient high-value cash crop products and crop rotations [19]. As water scarcity is considered a main limitation for agricultural expansion, high efficient crop patterns are recommended to minimize the consumed water amount [7].6 Breeding for High Water Use Efficiency CropsBreeding programs for the different crops always have two strategies to cope with water shortage. The first strategy is to introduce short-duration varieties especially for a high-water consumer such as rice. The Egypt’s rice program developed many rice varieties such as Giza 177 and Sakha 102 which require less water consumption. These varieties reduce the duration from seed to seed by 40\\xa0days [59]. Replacing long-duration varieties by new short-duration varieties is an encouraging way to save irrigation water in Egyptian agriculture. Rice is a great example for short-duration varieties. Maize, wheat legumes, and cotton are other examples. The reduction in the number of days means a reduction in a number of irrigations and consequently in the water quantity used [14]. Cultivating short-duration rice varieties saved about 18% of the water deliveries needed compared to long-duration rice varieties [35].The second strategy is breeding drought-tolerant plants and varieties through genetic transfer or agronomic practices. Breeding programs introduced new rice varieties that are more drought-tolerant and achieved higher yield with less water applied. Aerobic rice saves about 40% from irrigation water applied through irrigating every 12–15\\xa0days compared to the same varieties under conventional irrigation [60]. Developed types of rice withstanding drought, “Oraby 1 and 2,” consume 50% of the water when grown in furrows compared to traditional rice without any reduction of productivity [61]. The hybrid rice varieties as the Egyptian hybrid “1” and “2” produce higher yield from 14 to 16\\xa0ton/ha, while it saves more than 20% from irrigation water [62]. Stresses can be overcome from mild to medium levels by agronomic practices. This can include using different crops through increased salinity and drought tolerance according to their stress adaptation mechanisms to enhance crop productivity [19].7 Integrated Water Management for Sustainable AgricultureThe integrated water management for sust\", 'unique_identifier': 210}\n",

Sub-SaharanAfrica comprises 43 % arid and semi-arid area, which is projected to increasedue to climate change. Small-scale, rainfed agriculture is the main livelihoodsource in arid and semi-arid areas of SSA. Because rainfed agriculture constitutesmore than 95 % of agricultural land use, water scarcity is a major limitation toproduction. Crop production, speciﬁcally staple cereal crop production, will haveto adapt to water scarcity and improved water productivity (output per waterinput) to meet food requirements. We propose inclusion and promotion ofdrought-tolerant cereal crops in arid and semi-arid agro-ecological zones of SSAwhere water scarcity is a major limitation to cereal production. Sorghumuniquely ﬁts production in such regions, due to high and stable water-use efﬁ-ciency, drought and heat tolerance, high germplasm variability, comparativenutritional value and existing food value chain in SSA. However, sorghum issocio-economically and geographically underutilized in parts of SSA. Sorghuminclusion and/or promotion in arid and semi-arid areas of SSA, especially amongsubsistence farmers, will improve water productivity and food security.IntroductionSub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has the highest percentage offood insecurity globally (Clover 2003, FAO, IFAD andWFP 2014). Almost two of every three people in SSA live inrural areas, relying principally on small-scale, rainfed agri-culture for their livelihood (Food and Agriculture Organi-zation (FAO) 2014). In rural households, most food isproduced and consumed locally (Garrity et al. 2010), mak-ing household agricultural productivity critical to improv-ing food security (Schmidhuber and Tubiello 2007). Ruralpoverty accounts for 83 % of the total extreme poverty inSSA, and about 85 % of the poor depend on agriculture fortheir livelihoods (Byerlee et al. 2005). Small-scale rainfedagriculture is the main livelihood source in arid and semi-arid areas of SSA. The yield levels in such farming systemsare very low, especially during years of severe drought(Mavhura et al. 2015).Sub-Saharan Africa comprises 43 % of the area classiﬁedto an extent as arid (Food and Agriculture Organization(FAO) 2008). Under these conditions, water becomes thesingle most limiting factor to successful crop production.Climate change predictions for SSA suggest rainfall reduc-tion, variable distribution pattern, increased erratic rainfall,intraseasonal dry spells, and incidences of ﬂooding, hightemperatures,correspondingincreasedevaporativedemand and higher frequency of droughts (Ringler et al.2010, Schulze 2011). This causes SSA crop production tobe vulnerable because rainfed agriculture constitutes morethan 95 % of agricultural land use (Singh et al. 2011). Thiswill effectively compound the existing challenges to cropproduction and food security, hence underscoring the needfor improving effective use of water in rainfed agriculture(Blum 2009) as well as adoption of resilient crops (Headeyet al., 2012). In this context, resilient crops are those with ahigh ability to withstand or recover from water-stress peri-ods.Cereal crops are a major source of dietary energy in thediets of people in SSA (Chauvin et al. 2012). In principle,producing cereal crops is water intensive. Past and current© 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH1J Agro Crop Sci (2016) ISSN 0931-2250agricultural interventions have been focused on increasingproduction of high-energy crops in order to improve foodavailability and access. The approaches have also assumedthat improved availability would lead to stability (less pricevolatility) and guarantee sustainable access. These effortshave mainly focused on a few energy-rich cereal crops suchas maize, wheat and rice. While this has led to hugeimprovements in terms of crop production, it has alsoresulted in some of the cereal crops being cultivated in lesssuitable areas while suitable cereal crops have been rele-gated (Mabhaudhi et al. 2016a). This success has to beaccompaniedbymatchingcerealcropstosuitableagro-ecologies and maximizing on their genetic potential(Sebastian 2009); this could have greater impacts on foodsecurity. To ensure and improve food security, crop pro-duction, especially for staple food crops, should be focusedon water conservation and improved water productivity.Cereals are an important food source for human con-sumption and food security (Food and Agriculture Orga-nization (FAO) 2014), and SSA cropping systems amongrural subsistence farmers are largely cereal based. Themost widely cultivated cereal crops in SSA are maize (Zeamays L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), millet (Pennise-tum glaucum L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) (Edmondset al. 2009). Other cereals under production includewheat (Triticum spp.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), oats(Avena sativa), buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) andteff (Eragrostis tef Zucc.) (Haque et al. 1986, World Bank,2008). Of these, maize has high water requirements, whilewheat, barley and rice suffer high yield losses and cropfailure under water stress and during drought periods.MilletandsorghumareindigenouscropstoSSArenowned for their drought and heat tolerance. However,sorghum has a wider production distribution range, isproduced on a larger area and has higher yield outputthan millet. Sorghum can tolerate temporal waterlogging,which confers an advantage in ﬂooding situations. Sor-ghum’s drought, heat and waterlogging tolerance as wellas adoption by farmers make sorghum an ideal crop forproduction in SSA.Despite sorghum being the second most grown cerealcrop in SSA, the potential of sorghum’s drought toleranceto contribute to improving water productivity is relativelystill underutilized (Mabhaudhi et al. 2016b). This reviewproposes sorghum as an alternative cereal crop for cultiva-tion in SSA to enhance water productivity and improvefood security, especially in regions threatened by waterscarcity. This article reviews water use of cereal crops pro-duced in SSA and motivates for sorghum inclusion and/orpromotion in arid areas of the region. This is carried outby reviewing cereal crop production in SSA, identifyingagro-ecological zones (AEZs) and distribution thereof,identifying regions where inclusion and/or promotion ofsorghum would beneﬁt cereal production, and reviewingsorghum attributes, which make it uniquely poised as aniche crop in such regions.Water Use of CerealsDistribution of agro-ecological zones and comparativeadvantage of cerealsLand and water resources and the way they are used arecentral to the challenge of improving food security acrossthe world. Agriculture in SSA is 95 % rainfed (Singh et al.2011) with very limited use of external inputs such as fertil-izers. This means that the land’s agricultural production ofcereals depends almost solely on the agro-ecological poten-tial (Sebastian 2009). Agro-ecological zones are geographi-calareasexhibitingsimilarclimaticconditionsthatdetermine their ability to support rainfed agriculture. Sub-Saharan Africa can be divided into six AEZs, differentiatedby the length of the potential growing period for rainfedagriculture. Within these AEZs, rainfall ranges dramati-cally, from over 2000 mm year1 in central Africa to<400 mm year1 in arid areas (Bationo et al. 2006, Ringleret al. 2010). These AEZs are deserts, arid, semi-arid,humid, subhumid and highland regions. Sub-SaharanAfrica comprises 17 % arid area, 17 % semi-arid and 9 %dry subhumid, totalling 43 % of the continent classiﬁed toan extent as arid (Food and Agriculture Organization(FAO) 2008). About 60 % of SSA is vulnerable to drought,with 30 % of it considered as highly vulnerable (Mavhuraet al. 2015).Production of cereal crops in suitable AEZs with a com-parative advantage can potentially increase water produc-tivity under rainfed cropping systems. This could increasecrop yields without a corresponding increase in water use.Agriculture has seen a shift from increasing productionthrough increasing area under cultivation to focusing onwater conservation and increasing water productivity(Machethe et al. 2004, Fanadzo et al. 2010). Despite this,cereal production systems and trends in SSA remain largelyunchanged and dominated by maize production, even inarid regions. Cereal crop production increases have beendue to improvements in breeding and increased productionarea rather than improved water productivity.Cereal crop production in SSASub-Saharan Africa’s rural economy remains strongly agro-based relative to other regions (Livingston et al. 2011). Assuch, economic growth focused on agriculture has a dis-proportionately positive impact in reducing food insecu-rity. In SSA, cereals are a staple food for, and mostlyproduced by, resource-poor farmers. Cereals and cereal© 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH2Hadebe et al.products are an important source of energy, carbohydrate,protein and ﬁbre, as well as containing a range of micronu-trients such as vitamin E, some of the B vitamins, magne-sium and zinc (McKevith 2004). Land under cerealproduction in SSA in 2008 was 92 132 298 hectares (WorldBank, 2008). The most widely cultivated cereal crops inSSA are maize, sorghum, millet and rice, respectively(Edmonds et al. 2009). Being the largest crop produced,maize has cultural, economic and political signiﬁcance inSSA and is the dominant staple food for much of easternand southern Africa, while greater dependence on millet,rice and sorghum is found in western Africa (Doward et al.2004).Among the staple cereal crops, rice and maize have highwater requirements (Table 1); hence, the production ofcereal crops with low water requirements provides a com-parative advantage in water-scarce areas (Table 2). In largeparts of SSA, maize is the principal staple crop, covering atotal of approximately 27 Mha. Maize accounts for 30 % ofthe total area under cereal production in this region: 19 %in West Africa, 61 % in central Africa, 29 % in easternAfrica and 65 % in southern Africa (Food and AgricultureOrganization (FAO) 2010; Cairns et al. 2013). In southernAfrica, maize is particularly important, accounting for over30 % of the total calories and protein consumed (Food andAgriculture Organization (FAO) 2010). Among SSA AEZs,the subhumid zone constitutes 38 % of the total land areain SSA and has favourable rainfall (700–200 mm perannum) for maize production (Zingore 2011). Maize yieldshave stagnated and in some areas declined in SSA. One ofthe primary reasons is the lack of use of drought ameliora-tive measures (Fischer et al. 2014). This AEZ land area andrainfall is sufﬁcient for the production of maize and otherhigh water requirement cereals lacking drought and heattolerance. Rice lies fourth in area SSA area under produc-tion. In the decade, the growth of rice yield has droppedbelow 1 % per year worldwide and low yield constitutesone of the main challenges of rice production in SSA. Riceproduction is increasingly constrained by water limitationand increasing pressure to reduce water use in irrigatedproduction as a consequence of global water crisis (Zhanget al. 2012). Breeding attempts have resulted in NEw RICefor Africa (NERICA) initiative, which has led to the releaseof upland NERICA varieties with relatively less water usecompared to traditional lowland rice (Akinbile et al. 2007).However, even the NERICA varieties still have signiﬁcantlyTable 1 Growing conditions, production statistics and water-use characteristics of major cereals in SSACereal typeWater use (mm) pergrowing season1Average growingperiod (days)1Stress tolerancesWater productivity(WP) (kg m3)Water-use efﬁciency(WUE) (kg ha1 mm1)Maize500–800125–180–1.1–2.757.6–10.414Sorghum450–6503,6115–130Heat, drought, temporalwaterlogging and salinity0.6–2.7812.4–13.44Wheat450–650120–150–0.6–2.05,169.7–11.02Rice (paddy)450–9401190–150Waterlogging and ﬂooding0.6–1.654.5–10.911Barley450–650120–150–0.7–1.577.7–9.715Millet450–650105–140Heat and drought0.4–1.0125.1–10.44,10Teff450–550150–165Drought and waterlogging0.6–1.294.2–11.213WP and WUE values were quoted for grain yields where water use was above the minimum crop water requirements.

However, thesecrops are still susceptible to drought and heat stress andsuffer high yield losses under water stress. Teff, millet andsorghum have low water requirements beﬁtting rainfallranges in arid and semi-arid regions. Additionally, thesethree crops exhibit drought and heat stress tolerance. Sor-ghum and millet are highly drought tolerant, while teffexhibits a moderately sensitive and linear response to waterstress (Araya et al. 2011a). Sorghum, among the three cere-als, is particularly suited for arid and semi-arid AEZs inSSA as it is uniquely tolerant to temporal waterlogging.Temporal waterlogging tolerance is important under con-ditions of extreme, erratic rainfall which is experienced bycrops in SSA.It has previously been suggested that increasing pro-ductivity of cereals will improve food security in theregion (Romney et al. 2003). However, it is not about‘any’ but rather about improving the production of cer-eal crops that are suited to SSA’s AEZs. Cereal cropsthat have desirable water-use characteristics are currentlybeing overshadowed by the major crops in terms of pro-duction area, consumption trends and research atten-tion.This‘business-as-usual’approachtocerealproduction has resulted in declining yields for majorcrops such as maize (Fischer et al. 2014) and generalneglect of alternative cereal crops with potential to con-tribute to food security in marginal AEZs. Because wateris the predominant limiting factor in crop productionwithin SSA, a starting step would be reviewing the wateruse of the different cereal crops. This would allow ﬁttingthem into speciﬁc AEZs where each cereal crop possessesa comparative advantage.Water-use characteristics of cereal production in SSATo improve cereal yield in arid and semi-arid AEZs, it isimportant to understand their crop water use. Under rain-fed agriculture, water-use efﬁciency (WUE) of major cerealcrops becomes a key factor in increasing yield under waterscarcity (Blum 2005). Water-use efﬁciency is the yield out-put per unit evapotranspiration (soil evaporation plus croptranspiration) (Mabhaudhi et al. 2016a). To obtain WUEin cereal grain crops, the mass of the yield portion (pinna-cle, cob, head, etc.) is divided by crop water use (evapo-transpiration) from sowing to physiological maturity. Thisshould not be confused with water productivity (WP),which is the yield output per unit of water transpired bythe crop (Steduto et al. 2007). The difference betweenWUE and WP is highlighted below in the equations used tocalculate them.WUE ¼ total biomass or yield=Xevapotranspiration ð1ÞWP ¼ total biomass or yield=Xtranspiration:ð2ÞWater-use efﬁciency is a function of several factors,including crop physiological and morphological character-istics, genotype, planting population, soil characteristicssuch as soil water holding capacity, meteorological condi-tions and agronomic practices. In order to optimize yieldunder water-limiting conditions, an ideal cereal cropshould have a long and dense root structure, stay greencharacteristics, high harvest index and maintain high WUEunder stress. To improve WUE, integrative measuresshould aim to optimize cultivar selection and agronomicpractices (Azizian and Sepaskhah 2014).Among the agronomic practices for improving WUE iscrop selection. Multiple approaches have been proposed toimprove cereal production in arid and semi-arid environ-ments of SSA, for example supplementary irrigation andbreeding for drought tolerance in major crops (Edmeadeset al. 1997, Ortiz et al. 2007, Kijne et al. 2009, Cairns et al.2013). In this review, we propose production, promotionand inclusion of suitable drought-tolerant cereal crops toimprove water-use efﬁciency under arid and semi-aridAEZs of SSA. In comparison with teff and millet, sorghumhas higher WUE (Table 1). Additionally, sorghum has thehighest tonnage and number of SSA countries producing it.Lowest annual rainfall is experienced in arid and semi-aridAEZs of SSA. The situation is exacerbated by that receivedannual rainfall generally is not available throughout acrop’s growing season (Table 2). Therefore, actual rainfallreceived during a growing season is often lower thanquoted ﬁgures and also highly irregular. This makes sor-ghum production in arid and semi-arid regions of SSA aviablealternative(Table 2)forincreasingwaterproductivity in the region.Maize and sorghum have the highest upper water pro-ductivity thresholds compared with other cereals discussedin this review (Table 1). This implies that both crops havethe highest water-use potential and are preferred for pro-duction under conditions of zero or minimal soil evapora-tion. This can be attributed to relatively high yields inmaize compared with sorghum, and relatively low cropwater requirements in sorghum compared with maize.This means that maize can attain higher yields using morewater than sorghum, while sorghum attains lower yieldsusing less water than maize. High yield potential thus© 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH4Hadebe et al.gives maize comparative advantage for production in sub-humid and humid regions of SSA (Table 2). However,sorghum has higher water-use efﬁciency than maizemainly due to high tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses(Table 1). Thus, cropping sorghum is advantageous forproduction under water-limited areas and arid and semi-arid regions of SSA.Climate change and variability impacts in SSA willmainly be felt through water, that is increased frequency ofrainfall extremes such as droughts and ﬂoods (Schulze2011). Increasing rainfall variability will also expose cropsto episodes of intermittent water stress (Chivenge et al.2015). In addition, the percentage semi- and arid area ofSSA is predicted to increase, thus suggesting an increase inmarginal agricultural production areas. Therefore, we canno longer afford to side-line the production of drought-and heat stress-tolerant cereals.Impacts of climate change on cereal crop productionCereal crop production in SSA is projected (based on IFPRIIMPACT modelling) to decline by a net 3.2 % by 2050 as aresult of climate change. This will largely be due to pro-jected increased incidence of drought and temperatureswarming above global average. The largest negative yieldimpacts are projected for wheat (22 %), maize (5 %)and rice (2 %), respectively. Increasing the area undercereal crop production by 2.1 % will partially compensatefor the overall yield growth decline. On the contrary, milletand sorghum yields are projected to increase slightly underclimate change given their drought and heat stress toler-ance (Ringler et al. 2010). This highlights that the majorcereals’ (maize, rice and wheat) capacity to meet the foodrequirements of a growing population will be negativelyimpacted. As such, current research efforts for major cerealcrops are targeted at breeding drought- and heat stress-tol-erant cultivars that will be able to produce under theseconditions.On a positive note, these simulations suggest that underconditions of increasing water scarcity and high tempera-ture, millet, sorghum and other drought- and heat-tolerantcrops may become future cereal crops for production inSSA. However, current trends show that, in terms of landarea under cereal production, sorghum and millet still lagbehind maize even in arid regions of SSA. This implies thatpotential of sorghum is currently underutilized in theregion. There is a need to promote sorghum as a possiblefuture crop. In order to do this, there is need for empiricaldata describing its morphological, phenological and physi-ological characteristics that make it suited for productionin water-scarce regions. This knowledge will be importantin exploiting the potential of sorghum in arid and semi-arid regions of SSA.Sorghum Adaptation to Water StressThe effect of drought stress depends on the plant develop-mental stage at the onset of stress. Under ﬁeld conditions,drought stress can occur at any stage of crop growth rang-ing from seedling establishment, vegetative, panicle devel-opment and post-ﬂowering, and the period between grainﬁlling and physiological maturity (Rosenow and Clark1995, Rosenow et al. 1996). Sorghum is reputed for its abil-ity to tolerate water stress, both intermittent and terminalstress. This is mostly attributed to its dense and proliﬁcroot system, ability to maintain relatively high levels ofstomatal conductance, maintenance of internal tissue waterpotential through osmotic adjustment and phenologicalplasticity (Tsuji et al. 2003). Water-stress responses in sor-ghum can be of physiological, morphological and pheno-logical in nature. Sorghum genotypes differ in their degreeof drought tolerance, especially with respect to the timingof stress. Sorghum genotypes that exhibit good toleranceduring one developmental stage may be susceptible todrought during other growth stages (Akram et al. 2011).Such genotypic variation with respect to responses to waterstress allows for farmers to select varieties which best suitlocal farming conditions and hence making sorghum suit-able to a range of conditions.Physiological adaptationAbility to maintain key physiological processes, such asphotosynthesis, during drought stress is indicative of thepotential to sustain productivity under water deﬁcit. Sor-ghum exhibits physiological responses that allow a contin-ued growth under water stress (Dugas et al. 2011). Delayedsenescence, high chlorophyll content and chlorophyll ﬂuo-rescence as well as low canopy temperature and high tran-spiration efﬁciency are physiological traits that conferdrought tolerance to sorghum (Harris et al. 2006, Kapani-gowda et al. 2013). From a crop improvement perspective,manipulating these traits can increase drought tolerance insorghum.Crop species reduce photosynthesis through the modiﬁ-cation of photosynthetic apparatus under water stress.Reduction in chlorophyll content forms part of that modi-ﬁcation (Kapanigowda et al. 2013) to water stress. Chloro-phyll content is genotype dependent and varies accordingto plant stage (Van Oosterom et al. 2010, Wang et al.2014). Delayed senescence or ‘stay green’ is the ability ofthe plant to retain greenness during grain ﬁlling underwater-limited conditions (Borrell et al. 2014). Delayed leafsenescence in sorghum allows the continued photosynthe-sis under drought conditions, which can result in normalgrain ﬁll and larger yields compared with senescent culti-vars (Tolk et al. 2013).© 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH5Cereal Water Use: A Focus on SorghumStomatal conductance mediates the exchanges of watervapour and carbon dioxide between leaves and the atmo-sphere. Sensitivity of sorghum stomatal conductance to soilwateravailabilityandvapourpressuredeﬁcitvariesbetween genotypes. Sorghum partially closes stomata, rollsleaves and has a narrow leaf angle in response to water andheat stress, effectively reducing transpiration and exposurearea to solar radiation. Under intermittent water stress,partial closure of stomata is used to sustain reduced photo-synthetic activity, which ultimately results in high andstable WUE in sorghum compared with other drought-sus-ceptible cereals (Takele and Farrant 2013).Osmotic adjustment is conservation of cellular watercontent. In sorghum, osmotic adjustment is associated withsustained biomass yield under water-limited conditionsacross different cultivars (Blum 2005). Osmotic adjustmenthelps maintain higher leaf relative water content at low leafwater potential under water stress; this sustains growthwhile the plant is meeting transpirational demand byreducing its leaf water potential (Blum 2005). The osmoticpotential is adjusted through changes in the accumulationof proline, inorganic ions and other osmotic solutes(Sonobe et al. 2011). Increased deep soil water capture hasalso been found to be a major contribution of osmoticadjustment in sorghum (Blum 2005). Typically, in sor-ghum older leaves are selectively senesced under stress,while the remaining young leaves retain turgor, stomatalconductance and assimilation as a result of high osmoticadjustment in the younger leaves (Blum and Arkin 1984).This ensures photosynthetic activity by keeping top leavesgreen, and reduced transpiration water losses by oldershaded leaves under water stress. In addition, sorghum hasan effective transpiration ratio of 1 : 310, as the plant usesonly 310 parts of water to produce one part of dry matter,compared with a ratio of 1 : 400 for maize (Du Plesis2008). Hence, production of sorghum in water-scarceregions as an alternative to maize will conserve water andincrease water productivity.Morphological adaptationDrought tolerance in sorghum is consistent with its evolu-tion in Africa where domestication occurred in arid andsemi-arid areas parts of northern Africa (Morris et al.,2013). This resulted in the development of heritable mor-phological and anatomical characteristics (Dugas et al.2011). These attributes minimize yield losses associatedwith water stress.The root system is the plant organ in charge of capturingwater and nutrients, besides anchoring the plant into theground. It is naturally viewed as a critical organ to improvecrop adaptation to water stress (Vadez 2014). Under water-limiting conditions, water extraction by a dryland crop islimited by root system depth and by the rate of degree ofextraction (Robertson et al. 1993). Sorghum has long rootswith high root density at deeper depths (Schittenhelm andSchroetter 2014) with roots that can reach up to 2 m(Robertson et al. 1993) in the absence of impeding soil lay-ers. This allows sorghum to access water lower down thesoil proﬁle during water-scarce periods. Water stress can bedetrimental at vegetative stage if it inhibits root growth(Comas et al., 2013). However, this is seldom the case asunder water stress dry matter partitioning will often favourroot growth at the expense of vegetative growth (Mab-haudhi 2009). Maximum rooting depth usually occurs afteranthesis (Robertson et al. 1993). Drought tolerance andwater extraction efﬁciency in sorghum are associated withmaintaining high root length density, the number of nodalroots and late metaxylem vessels per nodal root underwater scarcity (Tsuji et al. 2005). For optimal root develop-ment, it is important that pre-ﬂowering water stress isavoided.Long, narrow, pointy leaves reduce the contact surfacearea with direct sunlight during high temperatures, hencepreventing desiccation. Sorghum leaves and stem are cov-ered by a waxy cuticle and epicuticular wax (Saneoka andOgata 1987) preventing excessive water loss during waterstress. This suggests that cuticle and epicuticular waxenhance WUE in sorghum during water stress.Tillering ability is commonly associated with sorghum inregions with limited rainfall. Tillering is generally recog-nized as one of the most plastic traits affecting biomassaccumulation and ultimately grain yield in many ﬁeldcrops (Kim et al. 2010). Genetic variation in tillering affectsthe dynamics of canopy development and hence the timingand nature of crop water limitation (Hammer et al. 2006).Simulation studies on sorghum (Hammer et al. 1996) indi-cated a signiﬁcant yield advantage of high-tillering types inhigh-yielding seasons when water was plentiful, whereassuch types incurred a signiﬁcant disadvantage in lower-yielding water-limited circumstances. However, tilleringhas been bred out of commercial cereal cultivars to ensuremaximum biomass partitioning to the yield portion.Nonetheless, tillering is a prominent feature in sorghumlandraces cultivated by subsistence farmers (Pandravadaet al. 2013) as these have not been the subject of deliberatecrop improvement. Whether tillering in landraces is beneﬁ-cial in arid and semi-arid SSA remains unclear; however,the fact that landraces still tiller may suggest that subsis-tence farmers ﬁnd an advantage to this trait. It may be thatsuch farmers associate tillering with yield compensationunder stressful conditions. Studies conducted by Lafargeet al. (2002) could not associate tillering with either yieldor drought tolerance. However, it is likely that emergenceof tillers is genetically controlled and partly serves as a sur-vival mechanism under water-stress conditions. Hence, the© 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH6Hadebe et al.selection of the best genotype is confounded by genotype-by-environment interactions for tillering (Hammer et al.2005).Phenological adaptationSorghum utilizes quiescence adaptive mechanisms to allowfor extreme drought tolerance (Dugas et al. 2011). It canremainvisuallydormantduringdroughtconditions,resuming growth once conditions are favourable (Assefaet al. 2010) ensuring crop survival and yield under terminalstress. Water stress affects sorghum at both pre- and post-ﬂowering stages of development. Pre-ﬂowering droughtstress response occurs when plants are under signiﬁcantwater stress prior to ﬂowering, particularly at or close topanicle differentiation and until ﬂowering (Kebede et al.2001). The most adverse effect of water stress on yieldoccurs during and after anthesis (Blum 2004). Post-ﬂower-ing drought stress signiﬁcantly reduces the number and sizeof the seeds per plant (Rosenow and Clark 1995), which arethe main causes for lower grain yield in sorghum (Assefaet al. 2010). Phenological plasticity of sorghum allows forshorter or delayed seasons in sorghum to minimize theeffect of water stress on yield.Water-use efﬁciencyWater-use efﬁciency captures the yield response of physio-logical, morphological and phenological adaptations towater stress. When water is scarce, understanding the mag-nitude of water consumption is important. In most cases,evaluation for decision-making requires information aboutefﬁciency – when water is being used, it is being used effec-tively. Water-use efﬁciency in sorghum is variety speciﬁc.During water stress, reduction in sorghum biomass pro-duction is minimized while water use is signiﬁcantly low-ered. Hence, maximal water-use efﬁciency (WUE) isattained under water scarcity conditions, while lowestWUE values are o', 'unique_identifier': 212}\n",

(doi: 10.13031/trans.13948) @2020Authors:   Richard G. Allen, Michael D. Dukes, Richard L. Snyder, Roger Kjelgren, Ayse KilicKeywords:   . Evapotranspiration, Irrigation requirements, Landscape coefficients, Landscape water requirements, Managed Stress, Microclimates, NAIP areal imagery.HighlightsA multi-component decoupling method for the landscape coefficient is described that provides a thorough means to estimate the water requirements of landscapes.The decoupling method considers differences in vegetation type, density, local climate, and soil water management.Methods for incorporating managed stress and frequency of irrigation are described.Winter or dormant season ET is described.The procedure in ASABE Standard S623 is a simpler form of the multi-component procedure and is complementary.Abstract. Water requirements of landscapes are highly variable due to the heterogeneous natures of landscapes, vegetation types, influence of buildings, and nutrient and water management. Objectives for water management of landscapes are for general appearance and health rather than for maximum biomass production. A multi-component method developed for the Irrigation Association (IA) and extended from the California WUCOLS procedure is demonstrated in which the landscape coefficient (KL, equivalent to a crop coefficient) is broken down into four components: vegetation type, vegetation density, microclimate, and managed stress. Each of these components can be estimated using readily made descriptions of a landscaped area and management objectives. One form of the KL equation is used to determine target KL that incorporates a target amount of soil water stress to support water conservation and to support water planning studies. A second form of the KL equation can be used to estimate the actual KL occurring under actual water management. The second form is used in studies of water balances and actual water conservation. The general decoupled equation is further expanded to optionally incorporate impacts of evaporation from exposed soil to assess impacts of irrigation frequency on total water consumption. The mathematics for the approach can be incorporated into software applications and smart irrigation controllers to produce improved water consumption estimates for landscape water requirements for use in irrigation scheduling, water requirement planning, and water depletion studies. The simplified procedure for estimating landscape water requirements in ASABE Standard S623 that is complementary to the IA procedure is discussed and compared. Both methods use a vegetation type and density system as the basis for efficiently estimating scientifically accurate landscape water requirements.(Download PDF)    (Export to EndNotes)6ShareFacebookXEmailLinkedInWeChat   Library HomeSearchObtaining Full-TextE-mail AlertASABE HomeAuthors, please use the Guide for Authors when creating your articles.Public Access Information  = Public Access (PA)  = PA Limited Time  = Open Access  = Contact Us For PurchaseAmerican Society ofAgricultural and Biological Engineers2950 Niles Road, St. Joseph, MI 49085Phone: +12694290300 Fax: +12694293852Copyright © 2024 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers', 'unique_identifier': 219}\n",

IoT, in particular, can improve the efficiency of agriculture and farming processes by eliminating human intervention through automation. The fast rise of Internet of Things (IoT)-based tools has changed nearly all life sectors, including business, agriculture, surveillance, etc. These radical developments are upending traditional agricultural practices and presenting new options in the face of various obstacles. IoT aids in collecting data that is useful in the farming sector, such as changes in climatic conditions, soil fertility, amount of water required for crops, irrigation, insect and pest detection, bug location disruption of creatures to the sphere, and horticulture. IoT enables farmers to effectively use technology to monitor their forms remotely round the clock. Several sensors, including distributed WSNs (wireless sensor networks), are utilized for agricultural inspection and control, which is very important due to their exact output and utilization. In addition, cameras are utilized to keep an eye on the field from afar. The goal of this research is to evaluate smart agriculture using IoT approaches in depth. The paper demonstrates IoT applications, benefits, current obstacles, and potential solutions in smart agriculture. This smart agricultural system aims to find existing techniques that may be used to boost crop yield and save time, such as water, pesticides, irrigation, crop, and fertilizer management.Keywords: agriculture; land monitoring; control strategies; IoT; sensors; economic growth; water management and water resources1. IntroductionThe Internet of Things (IoT) is an interconnected network of computing devices, people with unique IDs, and the capacity to communicate via a network without human interaction. The Internet of Things (IoT) intends to connect the physical and virtual worlds by interacting and exchanging data via the internet. Linked industries, smart cities, smart homes, smart energy, connected vehicles, smart agriculture, connected buildings and campuses, health care, and logistics are all examples of IoT applications [1]. The increasing need for food, both in terms of quantity and quality, has required the development and modernization of the agricultural sector. The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a promising set of technologies that may be used to provide a variety of agricultural modernization solutions. Scientific institutions, research institutes, and the agricultural sector are racing to provide more and more IoT solutions to agricultural business stakeholders, laying the foundation for a clear role when IoT becomes a mainstream technology [2]. The world’s biodiversity is anticipated to support between 9.4 and 10.1 billion people by 2050, increasing the need for specialized food production zones, especially for harvesting and livestock. This means that by 2050, global food production will have to grow by 70% [3]. Crop production is increasingly crucial in agriculture, with commodities, such as cotton, wheat, gum, and others, playing significant roles in many nations’ economies.In 2019, the IoT market was 690 billion dollars and was projected to be 1256.1 billion dollars by 2025 with a 10.53% CAGR globally from 2020 to 2025. Solutions are needed to assure timely and regular agricultural growth and yield due to the combined effects of a growing population, natural weather unpredictability, soil degradation, and climate change. Farm management, animal monitoring, irrigation control, greenhouse environmental control, autonomous agricultural machinery, and drones are examples of IoT applications in agriculture, all of which contribute to agrarian automation. It also demands contributing to agricultural food production’s long-term viability. Land appraisal, crop protection, and crop yield projection, according to these needs, are essential to world food production [4]. Farmers, for example, can manage field environments in real-time and more effortlessly regulate fields using wireless sensors and mobile networks. Farmers may also utilize IoT technology to capture essential data, subsequently creating yield maps that enable precision agriculture to produce low-cost high-quality crops [5]. Figure 1 depicts the smart precision agriculture cycle.Figure 1. Smart precision agriculture cycle.Smart agriculture is becoming increasingly important to farmers in the modern day, and it will become even more critical in the future to ensure proper field expansion and crop output. Unfortunately, traditional farming methods are not up to the task of meeting rising demand. As a result, the ground stays barren and devoid of fertility due to poor utilization of nutrients, water management, light, fertilizers, and pesticides. Crop diseases, water shortage, irrigation, and pesticide control monitoring are only some of the challenges that different IoT automation and control systems can efficiently address [6]. This is why contemporary agriculture employs smart equipment and tools from sowing through crop harvesting, storage, and transportation. The operation is smart and cost-effective due to its accurate monitoring capabilities and fast reporting using a range of sensors. Autonomous drones, harvesters, tractors, satellites, and robots are now complementing agricultural equipment. Sensors may be instantly placed and begin collecting data, which is then immediately available for further analysis over the internet. By enabling reliable data gathering at each place, sensor technology allows crop and site-specific agriculture [7]. Using advanced control methods to automate agricultural activities has increased crop production while also improving soil fertility.The following are the significant contributions made by this study:The world’s expectations of the agriculture industry, based on existing IoT approaches for providing solutions and new applications and technology.Identification of numerous application fields, as well as a summary of the most recent state-of-the-art literature on IoT technology.The Internet of Things’ task is to address these constraints and other challenges, such as resource scarcity and precise usage, climate change, etc.The rest of the paper is laid out in the following manner. Section 2 delves into the details of smart agricultural applications based on IoT technologies. Section 3 discusses the many types of equipment and technology available. Section 4 identifies unsolved problems and potential remedies. Finally, Section 5 concludes the research.2. Major Applications of Smart AgriculturePrecision farming, animal monitoring, and greenhouse monitoring are a few agricultural businesses utilizing the Internet of Things. Every element of traditional farming operation may be substantially improved by combining cutting-edge sensors and Internet of Things technology. At the moment, the Internet of Things’ (IoT’s) and wireless sensors’ harmonious incorporation into smart agriculture can catapult agriculture to formerly inconceivable heights. Appropriateness of land, pest monitoring and control, irrigation, and yield optimization are just a few of the conventional agricultural issues that IoT may assist in resolving through the implementation of smart agriculture approaches [7]. Figure 2 illustrates the comprehensive paradigm of smart agricultural monitoring system applications, facilities, and sensors. Agriculture applications are classified as IoT agricultural apps, smartphone-based agricultural apps, and sensor-based agricultural apps. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have recently been used to enable IoT applications for smart agriculture, including irrigation sensor networks, frost event prediction, precision agriculture and soil farming, smart farming, and unsighted object recognition, among others [8]. Significant instances of how new technology assists in the general improvement of efficiency at various stages are included here.Figure 2. General paradigm of smart agriculture.2.1. Monitoring of Soil Moisture and Water LevelsSoil monitoring has developed into one of the most challenging agricultural areas, both for manufacturers and farmers. Numerous environmental issues associated with soil monitoring affect agricultural yield. When these sorts of obstacles are correctly identified, farming patterns and methods become readily understandable. The soil’s moisture content, wetness, fertilizer application, and temperature trends are all being monitored. Soil’s moisture environment management system uses soil humidity and moisture sensors. By proposing an appropriate fertilizer approach, the results of a soil monitoring test report assist farmers in increasing crop yield [9]. The sensor can read both analog and digital outputs. The judgment is made based on data collected from sensors and compared to predefined threshold levels. The soil moisture sensor is used to regulate the irrigation system’s automatic operation. When the moisture level goes below the threshold value, the water pump is triggered [10].Soil mapping enables you to sow many crop types in the same field, allowing you to match better soil characteristics, such as seed compatibility, sowing timing, and even planting depth, as certain crops are deeply rooted while others are not. Additionally, growing many crops concurrently may result in more prudent agricultural practices, such as resource conservation. The system is composed of a distributed network of soil moisture and temperature sensors located in the root zone of the plant, as well as rain sensors located in various zones. The microcontroller collects and transmits all sensor data and information. In addition, a temperature and soil moisture threshold algorithm will be devised and implemented in a microcontroller-based gateway to regulate the amount of water given to the fields. Finally, the user is provided with control via an IoT module based on rain sensor data to interrupt or restart water flow as needed [11].If the field contains an adequate amount of water, no water will be pumped into it. However, when the soil’s water moisture content falls below a predetermined level, water is pumped into the field until the desired moisture content is attained. The DHT11 sensor monitors the field’s temperature and humidity. In addition, a PIR motion sensor detects when an intruder (human or animal) enters the area. Consequently, sensor values are continually monitored and displayed on the farmer’s mobile device through a GSM sim900A module, which includes a sim card with a 3G data pack and adds IoT capabilities to the system [12].2.2. System of Irrigation MonitoringNumerous studies have been conducted on a smart irrigation system. Food production technology must significantly improve to keep up with the growing demand for food. Numerous experts have worked diligently to create an alternative to irrigated farming. These efforts, however, have not yet resulted in a feasible solution to the irrigation system’s present problems. At the moment, crop irrigation is carried out manually and by established customary practices. When crops are given less water, they grow slower and absorb less calcium. Frequent irrigation kills roots and wastes water. As a result, accurate irrigation of crops becomes a considerable difficulty [13]. A smart irrigation management and monitoring approach is developed to enable autonomous delivery of sufficient water from a tank to field crops. Automatic sensor systems are cost-effective, offered for determining whether plants require watering based on information gathered from monitoring and regulating the soil water levels to minimize dryness or overflow [14].Kamaruddin et al., 2019 [15] developed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based wireless sensor network (WSN) architecture that manually or automatically administers and monitors the irrigation system. The proposed method used NRF24L01 and Arduino tools as the communication network transceiver and CPU. The soil moisture sensor data will be sent to the base station via NRF24L01. Then, the sensor node’s data will be sent to the cloud server through the base station. This project utilized Thingspeak as a cloud server to store all data in a database and connect it to an Android application.2.3. Fertilizer AdministrationAkshaya et al., 2020 [16] proposed an IOT-based technique and upgraded the previous system, which predicted agricultural yields using backpropagation and a random forest algorithm. It recommends fertilizer application rates and exclusively monitors atmospheric data via a mobile network and pump on/off action. The suggested technique utilizes a segmented tank to collect NPK fertilizer and water. The user can select one of three modes (manual, auto, or smart). In manual mode, the user is provided with the fertilizer and water ratios for well-known plants and fertilizers. In auto mode, all required is to know the plant’s name to select the appropriate fertilizer and water ratio. Finally, in smart mode, if the user cannot recognize the plant’s name, fertilizer ratio, or water, the plant’s name, fertilizer ratio, and water will be recommended automatically. The IoT module will continuously collect information on the temperature and soil moisture. The information collected will be stored in the IoT cloud. The mobile phone will inform you whenever the given data changes and the needed fertilizer ratio will be shown on the liquid crystal display.2.4. Crop Diseases and Pest ControlHuman operators frequently monitor insect pests via time-consuming and costly on-site inspections, which results in low spatial and temporal resolution. Remote monitoring has been possible due to advancements in remote sensing, electronics, and informatics. Monitoring costs and effectiveness can be optimized through the deployment of camera-equipped traps. With minimum human intervention, image analysis algorithms can locate and count insect pests captured in traps automatically.Reddy et al., 2019 [17] created an IoT-based system for disease and insect pest management in agriculture and the prediction of plant climatic factors. The integrated sensors help in the measurement of soil and atmospheric moisture and humidity. These features help determine the environmental conditions in which the plant flourishes and the plants’ illnesses. It detects disease on the field and sprays prescribed insecticides. Web cameras take images that are then preprocessed to include RGB to grayscale conversion, defect detection, image scaling, image enhancement, and edge detection. SVM is utilized to categorize characteristics generated from Citrus Canker diseases, such as energy, kurtosis, skewness, and entropy (damaged Lemon crop). The Arm7 microcontroller is used for hardware, power, sensors, and motor driver control. Once the illness is identified, the program will propose fertilizers and transmit the results to an LCD and the recommended fertilizers. By pump, the fertilizers will be sprayed on the diseased leaves. This study was confined to the lemon plant to demonstrate that the same method may be used for various crops with favorable outcomes in the future.A solution is presented for forecasting and detecting grape disease using the CNN approach and real-time gathered data on environmental factors. First, the CNN technique is utilized to analyze the leaf images. Then, different layers of the CNN method are used to create the image. Finally, it is scaled to a specific resolution before data is sent into the CNN layers for training and testing. The suggested algorithm was evaluated on four diseases known to have a higher effect on grape production. The diseases include esca black measles, anthracnose, leaf blight, and black rot. This gadget not only detects but also forecasts illnesses based on historical weather data. On the other side, the readings from the humidity, temperature, and soil moisture sensors are transferred through Raspberry Pi to Microsoft’s Azure Cloud. Following this, the sensor readings are used to anticipate the illness using a trained linear regression model. Based on the findings of the preceding detection and prediction stages, suggestions for appropriate fertilizers in the right quantities will be provided to minimize fertilizer misuse and cost savings [18].To detect pests in rice during field production and avoid rice loss, the Internet of Things supported a model-based UAV with the Imagga cloud offered. The Internet of Things-based UAV was developed on AI mechanisms and the Python programming prototype to transmit rice disease images to the Imagga cloud and supply insect data. The Approach identifies the disease and insects by integrating the confidence ratings of the labels. The label identifies the objects in the images. To determine the pest, the tag with the greatest confidence results and more than or equal to the threshold is chosen equal to the target label. If pests are discovered in the rice, statistics will be transferred to the field owner directly to take preventative actions. The suggested method is capable of detecting all pests that influence rice production. On the other hand, this research attempted to minimize rice waste during production by conducting insect monitoring at regular intervals [19]. Table 1 summarizes many current smart agricultural applications.Table 1. Selected applications based on smart agriculture.2.5. Yield Monitoring, Forecasting and HarvestingThe AWS IoT platform has been proposed for crop prediction using temperature and rainfall monitoring. The Raspberry Pi is utilized as a gateway for remote monitoring in this study. Raspberry Pi can connect with sensors to operate applications, such as the DHT11 Temperature Sensor and Soil Moisture Sensor, which forecasts temperature and rainfall ranges. The gateway is integrated with Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) IoT platform. MQTT is a messaging protocol that allows for various messages across distant connections [20].The study reported establishing an autonomous greenhouse smart aquaponics management organized on temperature via the use of an Android-based monitoring and automatic correction system and a Raspberry Pi-based plant growth monitoring system. Real-time data is collected using the light intensity sensor and the ambient temperature and humidity sensors. Additionally, the pH and temperature of the recirculating water are monitored. Suppose the data acquired is beyond the threshold range. In this case, the system quickly engages the correction devices, which comprise a peristaltic buffer device, an aerator, an evaporative cooler, inlet and exhaust fans, and grow lights. The internet remote access function enables real-time data transmission and receipt through the android app amongst the smartphone and computer system. This study compared plant development in smart aquaponics to traditional agriculture based on soil systems employing image processing in two investigational operations. Following record collection, it was determined that the smart aquaponics system achieved greater output than conventional agriculture monitoring. As lettuce, mustard greens, and pak choi are produced in a smart aquaponics system vs. traditional soil-based farming, this study focused exclusively on lettuce, mustard greens, and pak choi [21].A tree topology was used for the WSN-enabled agricultural monitoring system to improve performance. A cheap sensor node like a commercial sensor or a NodeMCU module transmits data to the control unit over Wi-Fi. Fertilizer, fertigation improvement, and agricultural operations are monitored by data processing and thresholding. The incorporation of cost-effective ICT technology with traditional crop management or weather monitoring and sensor data created the agronomic model. Minimal environmental impact from crop growing was achieved as a consequence of large fertilizer and water savings [22].2.6. Climate Conditions MonitoringIn farming, the weather is extremely important. Incorrect climate knowledge can have an impact on crop quality and quantity. On the other hand, farmers may use IoT solutions to put sensors in the field, including humidity sensors, temperature sensors, rainfall sensors, and water level sensors, to collect real-time data from the environment. These sensors monitor the state of crops and the environment in which they grow. If a worrying environmental situation is discovered, it is either automatically corrected or a warning is sent to the farmer.Greenhouses created an Internet of Things-based weather station to address the cost and accuracy issues. The TI CC2650 Sensor Tag and IBM Cloud Platform continuously monitor weather and abiotic factors, transfer the detected values to the cloud, and send e-mail notifications when values deviate. As a result, this study may be expanded to include the use of ML model-based classification training to categorize a plant’s health as excellent, moderate, or terrible based on the average temperature, humidity, light intensity, and air pressure. This would help to clarify abstracts about a plant’s health to a larger level and might aid in keeping the plants’ health in good shape [23].Ariffin et al. [24] used an autonomous temperature control system to address the drawbacks of traditional growing methods, which are expensive, have low yields, and need a lot of care. The suggested IoT-based architecture was evaluated in a real-world setting at the Bandar Puteri Centre of NASOM (National Autism Society of Malaysia). The ideal temperature for oyster mushrooms is between 20 and 30 °C, with a humidity level of 70 to 80%. Two sensors were installed in the mushroom house’s center and corner to detect temperature and moisture, then communicated to a remote monitoring station through a microcontroller unit for further action. The results of the six-day experiment revealed that an effective automatic monitoring system, which can regulate the farm’s home while reducing resources and human labor, was developed. The mushroom home, IoT control box, and Web Client interface were all designed within the system. As a result, the mushroom house provided a regulated environment for mushroom growing as well as protection from pests and insects. The climate control system, which automates controlling the ideal environment for oyster mushroom production, was housed in the IoT control box.3. Major Equipment and TechnologiesMajor equipment and IoT technologies are fully demonstrated in the next subsections, such as various sensors, agricultural drones, and harvesting robots.3.1. SensorsThe visual sensor, multispectral sensor, thermal sensor, lidar sensor, and hyperspectral sensor are only a few of the sensors utilized in IoT-based smart agriculture and drone technologies. Current IoT-based sensor applications in smart agriculture are presented in Table 2.Table 2. IoT-based sensors in smart agriculture used to increase production.3.2. Agricultural DronesUAVs can monitor the health of crops, apply pesticides, and take hyperspectral images in precision agriculture. Drones can scan a crop for issues in plants using visible and near-infrared light, and they can determine which plants reflect what quantities of green and NIR light. Photosynthetic activity diminishes when a plant is stressed. This data may be used to create numerous images that track plant changes and indicate their health. As a result, farmers can more accurately administer treatments after a disease has been identified. Drones are also utilized for surveillance, traffic monitoring, and weather monitoring in agriculture. Drone technology employs various sensors, including optical, multispectral, thermal, lidar, and hyperspectral sensors, which are briefly detailed in Section 3.1.Crop management has benefited from the Internet of Things, remote sensing, and analytic data approaches. Pests may be identified, targeted, and managed to utilize remote sensing using UAVs. UAVs can fly in tough and harsh terrains to take high-resolution images that allow pests to be identified and controlled. Many crop security concerns may be solved using UAVs equipped with cameras, which are not possible with traditional pest management methods. UAVs have been used to automate insect damage in agricultural areas [30,31].An automated rotating device based on sun illumination angle perception keeps the solar panel perpendicular to the sun and increases solar energy harvesting rates. Based on spectrum analysis technology, Internet of Things approaches, including several wireless technologies, such as TVWS, ZigBee, and LoRa, are suggested to collect data and send it to a base station/gateway to assess the degree of damage caused by pests and diseases. In addition, a technique for maximizing wind force usage and to extend the time of flight for drones has been established to support drones in downwind by designing the flying path implementation. The study’s scope is limited, with the goal of developing a long-standing insect and disease detection technique through extensive data gathering and analysis. The suggested model will be tested in real-world scenarios. For example, crop diseases and insects might be tracked in real-time and climatic changes could be analyzed [32]. The Internet of Things-based approach is illustrated for smart agriculture monitoring in Figure 3.Figure 3. IOT-based smart agriculture monitoring system.3.3. Harvesting RobotsUnder specific climatic circumstances, a harvesting robot is intended to gather fruits autonomously. The advancement of vision-based harvesting robots’ mechanism is yet in its early stages. Agricultural robotic systems, on the other hand, have comparable architecture. The system is comprised of an autonomous mobile platform, a lightweight mechanical arm with multiple degrees of freedom, an adaptable end effector for a power response system, a multi-sensor machine vision system, a smart decision and drive management system, and supplementary hardware and software [33]. Kang et al., 2020 [34] developed an intense neural network to assist robotic apple harvesting, which detects and grasps fruit in a real-time environment using a computer vision system. The proposed robotic harvesting system was implemented using a customized soft end-effector comprised of Intel i7-6700 CPU and NVIDIA GTX-1070 GPU and DELL-INSPIRATION main computer unit, Intel D-435 RGBD visualization camera, and UR5 Universal Robot (modern robotic manipulator). The proposed approach uses Mobile-DasNet, a computationally efficient lightweight one-stage instance segmentation network to conduct fruit recognition and instance segmentation on sensory input. An improved PointNet model was also developed to conduct fruit modeling and grip estimates from an RGB-D camera through the point clouds technique. The two qualities described above were utilized and integrated to develop and build a precise robotic system for autonomous fruit picking. The goal of the study was to improve the vision algorithm’s performance, boost, and improvements.Furthermore, the proposed soft end-effector robotic device may improve its grasping recognition proportion and effectiveness under various situations. Ogorodnikova and Ali [35] devised a technique for recognizing ripe tomatoes in a greenhouse setting using a machine vision system of a harvesting robot. To effectively execute the suggested image processing method for this purpose, RGB color images from a typical digital camera are required. In the second stage, RGB color images are converted to HSV, which is easier for extracting red tomato from the green backdrop in the image. Image segmentation, thresholding, and morphological operations separate a red tomato from a green background color photograph. The algorithm is built using Matlab methods and then evaluated to see if it produces favorable results. The process can be converted into fast-acting codes for the harvesting robot’s controller since it is basic and short. The research is limited to moving the gripper to the proper place in tomato detection and developing efficient algorithms using 3D gripper models to transform the existing research system into industrial robots.Only a few robotic devices that can successfully perform watering, planting, and weeding activities now exist. FaRo (Cultivating RObot), a new smart robot based on a CNC machine, has been presented for automatic crop farming deprived of human involvement in agriculture. What sets FaRo apart from other farming platforms is its capability to complete the entire farming cycle, from sowing to harvesting. In addition, the FaRo harvesting tool will be discussed and shown. FarmBot can only be used for a limited time, from sowing to harvesting, after which the robot’s tool mount system will be exchanged for crop harvest. In this example, the robot assumes the role of a tomato collector. Both the FaRo harvesting robot and the unique kinematics of the continuum manipulator design were thoroughly discussed. Due to implementation problems, the robot’s design is currently in the development stage. The objective of the proposed system is to build a model with an intelligent agricultural monitoring technique linked to the main database, and the robot will have sufficient information to plant and cultivate crops without the need for human intervention [36].A depth vision-based approach for detecting and placing truck containers is proposed for the joint harvesting system, along with three coordinate systems. This method included data preprocessing, point cloud poses transformation using the SVD (singular value decomposition) algorithm, upper edge segmentation and projection, RANSAC (Random Sample Consensus) algorithm edge line extraction and corner point positioning, and fusion and visualization of results on the depth image. Field trials show that the suggested approach is effective in identifying and positioning vehicles. However, the study is restricted due to its sensitivity to the appearance of truck containers and the presence of loud sites in the agricultural area. Autonomous driving and path planning in the forage harvester’s unloading system is still challenging [37].Intelligent robots have become extensively employed in various sectors as the intelligent computer industry with automation expands. Currently, manual labor is still used to harvest the majority of domestic crops. However, owing to constant worker pay hikes, the manual picking technique increases the fruit farmer’s financial expenditures, and the appliances of robots in the farming business are challenging. As a result, the smart moveable robot picker has been introduced based on computer vision machinery by incorporating the robot arm, selector, flexible carrier, track procedure, and the intelligence unit, which accomplishes the robot picker’s travel channel coding, auto-judging the ripe fruit, and in addition a vision-based binocular stereoscopic methodology empl', 'unique_identifier': 223}\n",

In this review, we describe the principles of several \\ncurrently commercially available sensors that can be adapted to this purpose, giving advantages and disadvantages of each \\ntype. We conclude that a sensor-based irrigation system has great potential to address the challenges associated with irrigation \\nscheduling, while improving water usage in most nurseries.\\nKeywords: automation, porous substrates, seedlings, small-volume container, timer system\\nINTRODUCTION\\nIrrigation water is becoming increasingly scarce in South \\nAfrica, with the agricultural industry using approximately \\n62% of available fresh water (Pimentel et al., 2004; Fanadzo \\nand Ncube, 2017). Ever-increasing demand for this limited \\nresource for household and industrial use, as well as \\nrecent droughts, has resulted in an urgent need for water \\nconservation (Gleeson et al., 2012). Thus, in commercial \\nnurseries which support the agricultural and forestry sectors, \\nit is becoming increasingly important to develop efficient \\nirrigation systems. Improved irrigation practices by nurseries \\ncan save water and reduce the costs of irrigation, and have \\nthe potential to improve seedling quality, reduce leaching of \\nnutrients, and lower the incidence of pathogen infestation \\n(Belayneh et al., 2013; Lichtenberg et al., 2013; Bayer et al., \\n2015; Saavoss et al., 2016; Lea-Cox et al., 2017; Wheeler et \\nal., 2017). Many biological and biophysical processes, such \\nas seed germination, seedling nutrition and growth, as well \\nas transpiration and evaporative cooling, are dependent \\non sufficient moisture via efficient irrigation (Bittelli, 2010; \\n2011). In most commercial nurseries, seedlings are grown \\nin containers with small-volume cavities ranging from 25 to \\n100 mL (examples of some forestry seedling containers are \\nshown in Fig. 1; Durner, 2013). This optimises the utilisation \\nof nursery and transportation space while ensuring the best \\nperformance when planted in the field. In such containers, \\nplant roots have a limited substrate volume to explore for \\nwater. Although space saving, one of the difficulties with \\nthese containers is that the substrate water status can range \\nfrom near-saturation immediately after irrigation, to near-\\ndryness after several hours without irrigation (Van Iersel \\net al., 2011; Montesano et al., 2016; Lea-Cox et al., 2017). \\nIrrigation scheduling for these containers should, therefore, \\naim at maintaining the media water content at levels that \\nminimise seedling water stress and maximise irrigation \\nefficiency during periods that require stress-free growth (Van \\nIersel et al., 2011).\\nCommercial nurseries generally irrigate their seedlings \\nbased on the visual appearance of the substrate (wet or \\ndry), their intuition and experience (growers may pick up \\nthe container to feel its relative ‘weight’), and often rely on \\na fixed timer-based system (Jones, 2004; 2008; Lea-Cox \\net al., 2011; 2017). Although the settings of a timer-based \\nsystem can be adjusted, it is set to irrigate according to a \\npredetermined schedule to apply water at a particular time \\nof day and for a particular duration (Nemali and Van Iersel, \\n2006; Montesano et al., 2016). Such timer-based systems have \\nbeen widely adopted due to their ease of use, relatively low \\ncost, ease of programming and success in irrigating correctly \\nwhen managed closely during periods of peak water demand \\n(Nemali et al., 2007; Lea-Cox, 2012). However, they can be \\nineffective and inefficient since water requirements may vary \\nby species, season, microclimate and changes in root density \\nor leaf area as the plant grows (Lea-Cox, 2012). For example, \\nsuch systems can waste water on cooler and cloudy days due \\nto fixed irrigation schedules which operate irrespective of \\nweather changes (Van Iersel et al., 2011). In addition, most \\nnursery managers are risk averse, preferring to apply excess \\nwater to ensure against system failure or heterogeneity of \\napplication (Jones, 2004; 2008). However, with increasing \\nwater costs and restrictions, it is becoming more necessary \\nto limit excessive water application. Therefore, scheduling \\nirrigation under fixed timer-based systems may be inaccurate \\nand costly and, considering these issues, there is a need for a \\nmore efficient method. \\nThe use of soil water sensors to control automated \\nirrigation systems is proposed as a useful alternative. \\nHowever, sensor-based irrigation systems are not widely used \\nin South African nurseries. This may be due to perceived \\n(i) high start-up costs, too expensive to adopt on a large \\n*Corresponding author, email: nkosinathi.kaptein@icfr.ukzn.ac.za\\nReceived 20 November 2017; accepted in revised form 26 June 2019\\nhttps://doi.org/10.17159/wsa/2019.v45.i3.6750\\nAvailable at https://www.watersa.net\\nISSN 1816-7950 (Online) = Water SA Vol. 45 No. 3 July 2019\\nPublished under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence (CC BY 4.0)\\n528\\nscale; (ii) difficulty in automation; and (iii) low reliability \\nand maintenance issues (Annandale et al., 2011; Lea-Cox, \\n2012; Belayneh et al., 2013). For most commercial nurseries, \\nthe initial cost and the ease of use are the most crucial \\nconsiderations for adopting a sensor-based irrigation system. \\nRegardless of these challenges, numerous sensors with the \\npotential to be adapted for use in nursery substrates are well \\ndocumented in the literature (Burnett and Van Iersel, 2008; \\nChappell et al., 2013; Bayer et al., 2015; Montesano et al., \\n2016; Saasvoss et al., 2016; Wheeler et al., 2017). Increasing \\nfreshwater scarcity, and pressure from governments, society, \\nand concerned bodies to conserve water, gives motive to \\ninvestigate sensor-based irrigation systems. Thus, the aim of \\nthis review was to evaluate commercially available soil water \\nsensors that can be connected to an automated irrigation \\nsystem to measure and control water status in small-volume \\nnursery containers to improve nursery water management.\\nSCheDUlINg IRRIgaTION IN Small-vOlUme \\nCONTaINeRS\\nSoilless substrates, as used in many commercial nurseries, \\nare generally porous and have relatively large particle sizes \\ncompared to mineral soils. They tend to release more water at \\nvery low matric potential (−1 to −40 kPa), which is 10 to 100 \\ntimes lower than the matric potential in mineral soils (Lea-\\nCox et al., 2011). Also, the rooting system of a nursery plant \\nis confined to the volume of the container. For these reasons, \\nmaintaining optimal water status for soilless substrates is \\ncritical for continued plant growth. A sensor-based system for \\nscheduling irrigation is a logical choice, and consists of sensors \\nlinked to an automated irrigation system that periodically \\nmeasure the substrate water status at a specified interval \\n(Nemali and Van Iersel, 2006; Van Iersel et al., 2013; Lea-Cox et \\nal., 2017; Kaptein et al., 2019). Since water use by the seedling, \\nalong with drainage and evaporation, causes a decrease in \\nsubstrate water level over time, the sensors detect these changes \\nin the substrate volumetric water content (VWC, m3∙m-3) or \\nsoil water potential (Ψ, kPa), and relay that information to \\nan irrigation controller (Fig. 2). The irrigation controller is \\nprogrammed to control (open) selected irrigation valves for \\nirrigation when the water level decreases below a set point \\n(Belayneh et al., 2013; Van Iersel et al., 2013; Bayer et al., 2015; \\nWheeler et al., 2017). The irrigation is then allowed to continue \\nuntil the upper set point of the programme is reached, at which \\ntime the irrigation valves are closed (Fig. 2).\\nIrrigation in small containers may be scheduled using \\ntwo properties, VWC or soil water potential, as described in \\ndetail by Jones (2004; 2008). The VWC indicates the quantity \\nof water available per unit volume of medium, which is easy \\nto measure and control as long as the lower limit (LL) and \\ndrained upper limit (DUL) thresholds are defined (Smith \\nFigure 1. Examples of different sizes of small containers used in many \\ncommercial forestry nurseries showing their associated volumes\\nFigure 2.

In contrast, the soil water \\npotential is the energy status of water per unit volume of \\nmedium, which directly determines whether the substrate \\nwater is available to plants (Scanlon et al., 2002; Jones, 2004; \\nBittelli, 2010; Lea-Cox et al., 2011). Both are related to each \\nother, but this relationship is different for different substrates \\nand depends on pore size distribution (Gebregiorgis and \\nSavage, 2006; Van Iersel et al., 2013). For example, substrates \\nwith larger pores hold less water compared to substrates with \\nsmall pores. This relationship can be determined using a \\nhydraulic conductivity relationship (Van Iersel et al., 2013; \\nSchindler et al., 2016). There is no consensus as to which \\nproperty is better suited for scheduling irrigation between the \\ntwo (Van Iersel et al., 2013), although VWC is relatively easy \\nto measure (Jones, 2004). If VWC is used, matric potential \\nshould also be estimated using hydraulic conductivity to \\ndetermine the plant available water. This is critical in highly \\nporous substrates such as pine bark due to its lower buffering \\ncapacity. Various VWC and soil water potential sensors that \\nmay be used in small-volume containers, and easily connected \\nto a programmable control unit, will be discussed.\\nvOlUmeTRIC waTeR CONTeNT meaSURemeNT \\nSeNSORS\\nThe main aim of measuring VWC is to monitor water status \\nas it diminishes and recharges within the root zone after each \\nirrigation event (Charlesworth, 2005). The commercially \\navailable soil water content sensors do not measure soil \\nwater content directly; instead they detect changes in other \\nsoil properties that can be related to the soil water content \\n(Charlesworth, 2005; Bittelli, 2010; 2011). The most common \\nsoil properties that change with soil water content and are \\neasy to measure include (i) dielectric permittivity (Van Iersel \\net al., 2013); and (ii) thermal conductivity (Song et al., 1998). \\nHowever, for accurate measurement, sensors need to be \\ncalibrated against the gravimetric method, which is the only \\ndirect soil water content measure (Smith and Mullins, 2000; \\nCharlesworth, 2005).\\nDielectric sensors\\nThe term ‘dielectric’ refers to the ability of a substance \\nto store charge from an electromagnetic field (Evett and \\nParkin, 2005; Van Iersel et al., 2013). These sensors use an \\nelectromagnetic technique to determine the VWC, since \\nwater has a much higher dielectric permittivity relative to \\nother constituents of the substrate (Smith and Mullins, 2000; \\nBogena et al., 2007; Bittelli, 2010). The main components \\nof a substrate that affect the dielectric permittivity are air, \\nsolid matrix and water content. The dielectric permittivity \\nof air and a solid matrix is 1 and 5, respectively, compared \\nto that of water which is 80 at 20°C (Czarnomski et al., \\n2005; Bogena et al., 2007; Nemali et al., 2007). Hence, a \\nsmall change in VWC can result in a significant change in \\nthe dielectric permittivity (Nemali et al., 2007; Van Iersel et \\nal., 2013). Thus, the measurement of dielectric permittivity \\ncan be used to indirectly estimate the media VWC through \\npredetermined calibration relationships using the equation \\nof Topp et al. (1980). For this review, frequency domain \\nreflectometry (FDR) and time domain reflectometry (TDR) \\nsensors will be further discussed due to their suitability for \\nuse in small-volume nursery containers.\\nFrequency domain reflectometry\\nMost FDR sensors (also referred to as capacitance sensors) \\nconsist of two prongs (positive and negative electrodes) that \\nproduce an electromagnetic field (Bittelli, 2010) when placed \\nparallel to each other (as shown in Fig. 3). The electromagnetic \\nfield is passed through dielectric material and then its ability \\nto store charge is measured. The charge stored by the substrate \\nand measured by a capacitor is directly related to the dielectric \\npermittivity of a substrate (Bogena et al., 2007). The sensor \\ncircuitry then converts the capacitor charge to a voltage, so it \\ncan be measured using a control unit. Since water molecules \\nstore charge more than other particles in the substrate, \\nthis charge storing ability can be related to VWC through \\nmeasurement of charge time t (s) using:\\n \\n \\n \\n(1)\\nwhere R (Ω) is the series resistance, C (μF) the capacitance, V \\n(V) the supply voltage, Vi the initial voltage and Vf the final \\nvoltage (Charlesworth, 2005). \\nWhen the VWC is high, the capacitor will charge slowly. \\nThis means that the capacitor of a sensor embedded in a wet \\nsubstrate will reach a given voltage threshold later compared to \\na capacitor in a dry substrate. More specifications, advantages \\nand disadvantages of FDR sensors are provided in Table 1.\\nThe FDR sensors are laboratory-calibrated by the \\nmanufacturer in different soilless substrates to produce a generic \\nequation. The factory generic calibration equation has an accuracy \\nrange of 0.03–0.05 m3∙m-3 (Meter Group, 2018a, 2018b). Although \\na generic equation may be used with reasonable accuracy, a \\nsubstrate-specific calibration may be conducted to estimate VWC \\nto within 0.01 m3∙m-3 of the actual VWC. For substrate-specific \\ncalibration, a single calibration equation could be used for a \\nsimilar model FDR sensor regardless of the substrate type (organic \\nor inorganic) (Nemali et al., 2007). Some of these sensors consist \\nof additional sensors that measure soil temperature and electrical \\nconductivity (EC) within the FDR sensor (Meter Group, 2018a, \\n2018b). These sensors have been used successfully to schedule \\nirrigation in several studies with highly porous soilless substrates \\nin nursery containers (Burnett and Van Iersel, 2008; Van Iersel et \\nal., 2010; Belayneh et al., 2013; Bayer et al., 2015; Montesano et al., \\n(\\n) (\\n)\\nln\\n/\\nf\\ni\\ni\\nf\\nt\\nRC\\nV\\nV\\nV\\nV\\nV\\n\\uf8ee\\n\\uf8f9\\n= −\\n−\\n+\\n−\\n\\uf8f0\\n\\uf8fb\\nFigure 3.

Improvements in \\nplant growth, reduction in water usage, and fewer incidences of \\npests and diseases were reported.\\nTime domain reflectometry\\nThe TDR technology was initially used to find the break in power \\nlines. Instead of manually inspecting a power line, a pulse is sent \\nalong the cable, and the time taken for the pulse to reflect indicates \\nthe precise point where the cable is broken. A TDR sensor works \\nsimilarly by sending electromagnetic waves from the pulse \\ngenerator of a cable tester to diffuse in the substrate where there is \\na parallel pair transmission line (Topp et al., 1984; Nobori, 1996). \\nElectromagnetic waves are diffused through a coaxial cable to \\na probe inserted in a substrate. Some of these electromagnetic \\nwaves are reflected at the beginning of the probe due to impedance \\ndifferences between the cable and the probe, whereas the rest of \\nthe waves diffuse through the probe until they reach the end of the \\nprobe where they are reflected (Noborio et al., 1996). Therefore, \\ndielectric permittivity can be calculated considering that the \\ntransmission velocity is determined from the known length of the \\ntransmission line in the substrate using (Topp et al., 1984):\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n/\\nKa\\n= ct l\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n(2)\\nwhere Ka is the soil dielectric constant, c the velocity of an \\nelectromagnetic signal in free space (i.e. speed of light, 3 x 108 \\nm∙s-1), t the travel time of the voltage pulse and l the length of \\nthe soil transmission line (mm). Since substrate water content is \\nthe main factor that alters the dielectric permittivity (Ka), VWC \\ncan be calculated using (Topp et al., 1980):\\n2\\n2\\n4\\n2\\n6\\n3\\nVWC \\n 5.3 10\\n2.92 10\\n –  5.5 10  \\n4.3 10  \\na\\na\\na\\nK\\nK\\nK\\n−\\n−\\n−\\n−\\n= −\\n×\\n+\\n×\\n×\\n+\\n×\\n(3)\\nThe specifications, advantages and disadvantages of TDR \\nsensors are further outlined in Table 1.\\nInfluence of substrate properties on dielectric \\npermittivity\\nThe dielectric permittivity may be influenced by factors other \\nthan the VWC (Smith and Mullins, 2000; Lukanu and Savage, \\n2006). Studies have indicated that dielectric sensors may be \\naffected by the substrate temperature and EC (Scanlon et al., \\n2002; Bogena et al., 2007; Bittelli, 2010; 2011). However, the new \\ngeneration of VWC sensors have a built-in temperature sensor \\nthat corrects for error in VWC estimation due to temperature \\nchanges, for example, a model 5TM or TEROS 10 (Meter \\nGroup, Inc., Pullman, WA, USA).\\nIn a nursery, most substrates used as potting media are a \\nunique blend of organic and inorganic materials, and seedlings \\nare frequently irrigated with water-soluble fertilisers. This can \\nresult in an increased concentration of ions of fertiliser salts \\nnear the electromagnetic field of a dielectric probe which could \\nweaken the electromagnetic energy and affect the measured \\nVWC (Nemali et al., 2007; Rosenbaum et al., 2010). In a study \\nby Kizito et al. (2008), a measurement frequency of 70 MHz \\nmitigated the effects of EC and temperature on FDR sensors \\n(model EC-5 and ECH2O-TE, Meter Group). Latest FDR sensors \\nmeasure dielectric permittivity using an oscillator operating at a \\nfrequency of 70 MHz making this sensor insensitive to EC below \\n10 dS∙m-1 (Meter Group, 2018a, 2018b). To be able to measure \\nin substrates with EC greater than 10 dS∙m-1, substrate-specific \\ncalibration is a necessity, although such high EC is extremely \\nuncommon in nursery substrates since it will most likely cause \\nroot death in most plant species. Increasing measurement \\nfrequency to higher frequencies (i.e. 150 MHz) decreases the \\nsensor sensitivity to EC considerably; however, this increases \\nsensor cost due to the increase in sensor electronics. \\nThe effect of poor substrate-to-sensor contact caused by \\nuneven packing of substrate in containers has been reported \\nby Bogena et al. (2007), Nemali et al. (2007) and Van Iersel \\net al. (2010). This may be critical in some nurseries where \\nthe substrate is manually packed in small-volume containers \\nTable 1.

(1991) and has since been used by several \\nresearchers (Tarara and Ham, 1997; Song et al., 1998; Ochsner \\net al., 2003). This technique measures changes in soil thermal \\nproperties (Song et al., 1998; Bittelli, 2010; 2011) caused by \\nthe variation in the VWC. Tarara and Ham (1997) describe \\nthe technique in detail, and Fig. 4 shows a probe with needle \\nlength of 30 mm. A heater and a temperature probe (usually a \\nthermocouple) are used to determine the substrate volumetric \\nheat capacity, which can be converted into VWC using:\\n(\\n)\\n(\\n2\\n [ /\\n –  19.92\\n  2.51\\n/ 4.18\\nm\\nm\\nVWC\\nq\\ne r\\nT\\nx\\nπ\\n\\uf8f9\\n=\\n∆\\n+\\n\\uf8fb\\n \\n(4)\\nwhere q (J∙m-1) is the heat applied per unit length of the line \\nsource, e is the natural logarithm base, r (m) is the distance \\nbetween the heater probe and temperature probe, ∆Tm is the \\nmaximum temperature increase of the needle (°C) and xm is \\ndetermined by dividing the substrate bulk density by particle \\nsize (Song et al., 1998).\\nThe small compact size of the DNHP sensor enables \\nmeasurements of small substrate volumes such as water content \\naround a growing seed (Tarara and Ham, 1997). Bristow et al. \\n(1993) compared the VWC as measured using DNHP sensors \\nversus the VWC measured by gamma attenuation in repacked \\nsoil in the laboratory. The DNHP sensors estimated VWC to \\nwithin 0.04 m3∙m-3 of the gamma attenuation method at both \\nthe LL and DUL. However, large differences between VWC \\nmeasured with DNHP sensors versus using the gravimetric \\nmethod were observed by Tarara and Ham (1997) at high water \\ncontent. At water contents less than 0.30 m3∙m-3, the DNHP \\nprobe estimates were within 0.06 m3∙m-3 of the gravimetric \\nmethod. The probes of this sensor type are very fragile and \\nspecial care needs to be taken so that the distance between the \\nneedle probes does not alter (Campbell et al., 1991; Bittelli, \\n2010). A needle deflection of 1 mm may cause a 6% error in \\nVWC measurements (Song et al., 1998; Scanlon et al., 2002). \\nThe conversion of a temperature signal from analogue to digital \\nmay cause a measurement error in ∆Tm (Bristow et al., 1993; \\nSong et al., 1998). This, however, can be minimised by increasing \\nthe datalogger sampling frequency by using a high resolution \\ndatalogger and applying sufficient power to the heater probe \\nso that ∆Tm exceeds 0.5°C. This sensor is also susceptible to \\nsubstrate temperature gradients (Scanlon et al., 2002), which \\nmay be significant in a nursery environment, and therefore \\nprecise substrate temperature measurements are needed. For \\nthese reasons, this type of sensor should be used with caution in \\nscheduling nursery irrigation, and, in most cases, is not practical.\\nmeaSURINg The SUbSTRaTe waTeR pOTeNTIal\\nThe concept of soil water potential is not new. As early as \\n1908, the first attempts to measure soil water potential were \\nconducted using the Livingston disc (Crawford, 2015). A dry \\nceramic disc would be weighed, then placed in soil so that it \\nequilibrated with the surroundings. After equilibration, it was \\nremoved, cleaned and weighed again. Soil water potential was \\nthen calculated using the water retention curve of the disc. \\nOver 100 years later, there have been many advances in soil \\nwater potential sensor technology, but these sensors still rely on \\nwater potential equilibration. Most commercially available soil \\nwater potential sensors accurately measure within the 0 to −100 \\nkPa range, which is ideal for most nursery crops since they \\ngenerally exhibit signs of water stress at matric potential less \\nthan −100 kPa. Different techniques for measuring soil water \\npotential in small-volume seedling containers are examined \\nand summarised in Table 2.\\nTensiometers\\nIn 1960, a liquid calibration technique called tensiometry was \\ndiscovered (Charlesworth, 2005). This method, along with \\nsoil psychrometry, was and still is the only direct method \\nof measuring soil water potential. If correctly installed, a \\ntensiometer is the most accurate soil water potential sensor in \\nwet substrate (0 to −90 kPa) (Charlesworth, 2005; Bittelli, 2010). \\nFor an in-depth understanding of tensiometer measurement \\ntheory, see Smith and Mullins (2000) and Bittelli (2010). The \\nadvantages and disadvantages of tensiometers are outlined \\nin Table 2. Small tensiometers fitted with transducers to \\nmeasure and control the water potential in small-volume \\nsoilless substrates were reported by Bittelli (2010). A schematic \\ndiagram of such a tensiometer is shown in Fig. 5, with a \\ndiameter of 5 mm for an easy fit in a small-volume container. \\nThe transducer is used to convert the tensiometer tension to an \\nelectrical signal that may be sensed by a control unit.\\nWhen tensiometers are used, precautionary measures are \\nnecessary to ensure direct contact between the porous ceramic \\ntensiometer tip and the substrate, and correct positioning \\nof the sensor. If the substrate shrinks, or the tensiometer is \\ndisturbed, this contact may be interrupted after which air \\nmay enter and break the water column resulting in inaccurate \\nmeasurements. In soilless substrates, fine roots might develop \\naround the ceramic tip. This is common when the substrate \\ndries out and the ceramic tip becomes an unreliable but \\nassured water source (Meter Group, 2009). When the substrate \\nbecomes drier than −90 kPa, cavitation occurs, where \\nliquid water pressure inside the tensiometer tube changes \\nto water vapour pressure causing spontaneous evaporation \\nand formation of air bubbles as described by Bittelli (2010). \\nHowever, the new commercially available tensiometers can \\nmeasure up to −500 kPa without cavitation, for example, a \\nmodel T5x mini tensiometer (Meter Group). This is made \\nFigure 4.

Van der Ploeg et al. (2010) also investigated \\npolymer tensiometers that are not affected by cavitation and \\nhave an extended measurement range to −2 000 kPa. These \\ntensiometers consist of a swelling polymer that creates a \\npositive pressure, and when the substrate is wet it absorbs \\nwater, creating a pressure offset. These tensiometers are, \\nhowever, not yet well researched for use in nursery soilless \\nsubstrates. Charlesworth (2005) reported on equitensiometers \\nthat use the principle of dielectric sensors to measure the \\nwater potential. These sensors do not require substrate-specific \\ncalibration since they measure the water potential of the \\nceramic material and not the surrounding substrate. \\nheat dissipation sensors\\nAs early as 1940, Shaw and Baver (1940) proved that soil water \\npotential could be inferred from the rate of heat dissipated \\nin the soil, and many sensors have been developed based on \\nthis relationship. Flint et al. (2002) described heat dissipation \\nprobe measurement theory in detail and a sensor is shown in \\nFig. 6. The sensor has a ceramic cup which equilibrates with the \\nsubstrate. Following equilibration, a heating element is heated \\nfor a specific period, and a change in the substrate temperature is \\nthen measured. The temperature change depends on the thermal \\nconductivity of the ceramic cup, which is affected by the VWC \\nof the substrate (Flint et al., 2002; Scanlon et al., 2002; Bittelli, \\n2010). Thus, the VWC, which is related to the water potential \\nof the ceramic cup, can be determined through a hydraulic \\nconductivity relationship.

Irrigators require well-defined irrigation thresholds to initiate irrigation to maximise water productivity. Such thresholds do not exist for temperate rice regions. Adopting a strategy that has been reported to succeed in non-temperate environments may fail in temperate climates, and therefore, needs investigation. This study aimed to investigate, in a temperate Australian environment, the effect of increasing soil moisture deficit during the rice vegetative period on crop physiological development, grain yield and water productivity. The study was conducted in a commercial farm using a randomised complete block design in the 2020/21 and 2021/22 growing seasons. Automated gravity surface irrigation technologies were adopted to enable high-frequency irrigation. Extending soil moisture deficit beyond 15 kPa was found to significantly delay panicle initiation by at least 13–14 days, exposing rice to cold temperatures in Year 1 during the cold-sensitive early pollen microspore period. This reduced yield by up to 55% (4.5 t/ha) compared to the 15 kPa treatment that was not impacted by cold sterility. In the absence of cold sterility, irrigated water productivity and total water productivity ranged between 1.02 and 1.61 t/ML, and 0.84 and 0.93 t/ML, respectively. The highest yields (8.1 and 7.5 t/ha) were achieved irrigating at a soil tension of 15 kPa in growing seasons 2020/21 and 2021/22. This research demonstrates that sound water productivity can be achieved with aerobic rice cultivation in temperate climates, providing cold temperatures during early pollen microspore are avoided. The quantification of the delay in crop development caused by increasing soil moisture deficit provides rice farmers greater confidence in determining the irrigation strategy and timing of pre-emergent irrigation in regions at risk of cold sterility. However, due to the high labour demand associated with aerobic rice, the adoption of aerobic rice at a commercial scale in this Australian environment is unlikely without adopting automated irrigation technology.Keywords: water saving irrigation; water productivity; oryza sativa; automated irrigation; deficit irrigation; soil tension; rice irrigation1. IntroductionRice is the largest irrigated crop and accounts for 30% of the global irrigated area whilst being a staple food for over 50% of the global population [1,2]. Relative to other crops, rice is a high-water use species [2,3,4]. Global water scarcity is increasing due to increased demand from urban and industrial users, silting of reservoirs, chemical pollution, decreasing groundwater tables, salinisation, livestock production, as well as social and other environmental pressures [5]. As a consequence of reduced water availability for irrigation and increasing water costs, rice farmers must enhance water productivity to maximise rice production per unit of applied water.Rice has traditionally been grown under continuously flooded situations in an anaerobic environment for the majority of the season (from the 3-leaf stage until physiological maturity). This practice aims to maximise yields by meeting rice crop evapotranspiration needs, reducing weed and pest pressures and providing a thermal buffer in temperate environments during the early pollen microspore period when the crop is sensitive to low temperatures [6,7,8,9]. Water-saving irrigation techniques for rice have been investigated around the world with the aim to reduce water use whilst maintaining or improving grain yields. One such strategy termed alternate wetting and drying (AWD), consists of periodic soil drying and re-flooding, generally to 2–5 cm a few days after the disappearance of ponded water [10,11]. Delayed permanent water (DPW) is a water-saving strategy in which the soil is left to dry between irrigation events in the early vegetative period and delays the onset of permanent water until just before panicle initiation [12]. Mid-season drainage and aerobic rice (understood here as periodic irrigation without maintaining a flood at any time in the growing season) are also techniques implemented to reduce water use. Decreasing the depth of flooded water (normally 5–10 cm above ground) to soil saturation or implementing AWD techniques has reduced water input by ~40% compared to continuously flooded rice in Japan, Uruguay, India and the Philippines with little or no yield loss, provided adequate weed control is achieved [13,14,15,16].Advances in water productivity have also been achieved without any period of ponding as is the case for aerobic rice, compared to continuous flooding due to a significant reduction in water use. However, minor yield penalties often ensue with yields generally below 6 t/ha [13,17,18,19,20]. Environmental factors, cultivar selection, the extent, duration and frequency of drought stress and water table height are all factors found to influence the extent of yield reduction when rice is grown in non-ponded systems [11,13,18].A review of global aerobic rice production by Kato et al. [19] concluded that aerobic rice production in temperate regions can produce in excess of 9 t/ha, whilst yields in tropical areas are limited to less than 8 t/ha. Whilst the review highlighted studies on rice grown under aerobic conditions that achieved yields in excess of 8 t/ha, many were from subtropical environments with associated lower vapour pressure deficit and solar radiation [21,22,23,24] with no yields > 8 t/ha from truly temperate environments outside of Japan. Comparatively, growers of flooded rice in temperate Australia achieve in excess of 10 t/ha [25,26], with the next highest yielding rice producers (Tajikistan, Egypt, Uruguay, USA and Peru (8–9 t/ha) [25]) also predominately from temperate environments. Widespread adoption of non-ponded rice is not evident in these high-yielding temperate regions which can be exposed to cold-induced sterility, heat stress and high evaporative demand [8,9]. In the absence of ponded water, under mild water stress, stomatal closure reduces evaporative cooling, thus high temperatures can severely damage rice during the reproductive period [27].Despite substantial water savings, the yields of non-flooded/aerobic rice were generally considered unacceptable in the sprinkler and flood-irrigated experiments conducted in temperate Australia in the 1980s [28,29,30]. Yield reduction was likely a result of a large soil moisture deficit with leaf rolling, wilting and senescence reported, particularly in the once-a-week irrigation regimes [28,29] and when the sprinkler experienced issues [30]. As such, the practice was not adopted at a commercial scale. However, delaying the onset of permanent water until just before panicle initiation has successfully reduced water use by 15–23% whilst maintaining or increasing yields [12,28]. This highlights the ability of rice grown in temperate environments to withstand water stress in the vegetative stage and significantly increase water productivity. Nevertheless, the adoption of DPW does not appear to be widespread in any temperate rice regions, possibly due to agronomic and labour challenges associated with irrigation prior to the permanent flood or due to variability of irrigation regime producing inconsistent results. However, the extent of soil moisture deficit between irrigation events prior to the application of permanent water was found to vary considerably (−20 to >−120 kPa) in different temperate Australian rice fields [31].Scheduling irrigation frequency based on number of days since the last irrigation [28,29,30] or crop evapotranspiration without definitive crop coefficients [12] may result in under- or over-irrigation due to the effects of different soil types and climatic conditions. This is evident with severe leaf rolling, scorching and stunting reported by [28,29,30] when irrigation occurred on a 7-day interval, whilst simultaneously observing water runoff under a sprinkler irrigation system [30]. As such, an absolute value irrigation threshold that is easily measured and accounts for environmental variation may provide farmers with confidence to adopt water-saving rice irrigation practices should sound water productivity be achieved. Soil-water or plant-water-based sensing would likely provide more accurate irrigation scheduling due to the influence of soil type, crop management and variable evapotranspiration with Tuong et al. [11] recommending irrigation scheduling based on soil water potential rather than the number of days for AWD rice. Soil moisture sensing has long been applied in the field and is considered easier to measure and automate than plant-based sensing with a number of commercial sensors available [32]. Cost-effective and appropriate sensing with definitive thresholds to schedule irrigation in water-saving rice lends itself to incorporation into automated gravity surface irrigation which is an emerging technology used to overcome the increased labour issues associated with high frequency irrigation experienced with aerobic rice production [33].Soil moisture tension describes how strongly water binds to soil and is measured in units of pressure (kPa) with saturated soil measuring > −10 kPa and more negative numbers indicating greater tension and more effort for the plant to extract water from the soil. Soil moisture tension-based thresholds have previously been used to initiate irrigation events in water-saving rice [17,34,35,36,37,38]. Only one such study using soil moisture tension in a temperate environment can be found [35]. These authors reported sprinkler-irrigated aerobic rice yields (7.9–9.4 t/ha) to be equivalent to or higher than continuously flooded rice (8.2 t/ha) when irrigation was triggered at a soil tension of −60 kPa at 20 cm below ground. However, in other regions, the more generally accepted threshold is between −10 and −30 kPa [13,17,24,39]. Using soil tension thresholds determined in studies from other environments may fail in temperate climates. Evidently, there is a need to further investigate the impact of varying degrees of soil moisture deficit in temperate high-yielding production systems with new varieties aimed at maximising water productivity.Research has shown a physiological delay to panicle initiation (PI) and anthesis in aerobic rice compared to continuous flood [28,29,30,40]. Similarly, Dunn and Gaydon [12] increased the time between irrigations in DPW to delay PI and anthesis, recommending earlier sowing of rice grown under DPW to avoid cold-induced sterility during reproductive periods. Australian rice varieties are sensitive to cold temperatures during early pollen microspore [9], which occurs about two weeks after the more easily identifiable PI. Quantification of the maturity delay associated with soil moisture deficit is required to enable sowing and ease of irrigation scheduling so farmers can manage irrigation water to avoid unfavourable growing conditions during sensitive growth periods.The Australian rice industry has set a water productivity target of 1.5 t/ML (ton/Megalitre) by 2026, which is a significant increase on the current industry average of 0.85 t/ML [26]. This will require a radical shift in the way rice is grown and managed with aerobic rice hypothesised as a potential solution to achieving the ambitious target. However, a better understanding of the impact soil moisture deficit has on yield per ML and quantification of the delay in maturity is required. Enhanced progress to achieve the goal of 1.5 t/ML is likely with breeding efforts focused on cold-tolerant varieties to decrease the likelihood of cold-induced sterility. It is, therefore, imperative to determine an appropriate irrigation schedule for non-ponded rice in high-yielding temperate rice systems.Provided plant water stress is avoided during the reproductive period, it is hypothesised that sound yield and water productivity can be achieved under mild to moderate soil moisture deficit during the vegetative period with severe soil moisture deficit hypothesised to delay plant development. This aerobic rice study implemented various soil moisture deficit thresholds during the vegetative period aimed to determine the most appropriate irrigation regime for aerobic rice in temperate environments. The experiment was conducted on a commercial scale to better understand the real impacts of aerobic rice cultivation and to better engage with rice farmers and industry stakeholders. The specific objectives of the trial were to determine the effect of increasing soil moisture deficit during the vegetative period on (i) crop development, (ii) grain yield, and (iii) water productivity.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Site DescriptionThe experiment was conducted over the 2020–2021 (Year 1) and 2021–2022 (Year 2) rice growing seasons (October–May) on a commercial farm located in the Murrumbidgee Valley in south-eastern Australia near Griffith (34°17′18″ S, 146°03′03″ E). The soil was classified as a self-mulching clay with a brown A horizon of 30 cm over a dense red B horizon [41] which is typical of rice-growing soils in the region. Soil samples were collected at 0–15 cm depth before planting in 2020–2021. Physical and chemical characterisation was obtained through laboratory analysis [42] (Table 1).Table 1. Initial physical and chemical properties of the experiment soil.The Murrumbidgee Valley has a temperate climate typified by hot dry summers with low humidity. The average annual rainfall for Griffith is 385 mm with an average in-season (15 October–30 April) rainfall of 150 mm and evapotranspiration of 1150 mm [8]. Weather observations were taken from a weather station located 10 km from the trial site. Monthly average observations can be seen in Table 2. The 2020–2021 (Year 1) rice season was characterised by very low night-time temperatures experienced during the reproductive period in January, February and March (Figure 1). In-season rainfall was 175 mm. Reference evapotranspiration for the period 15 October–30 April was 1259 mm. The 2021–2022 (Year 2) season started cool with unseasonable wet conditions in November–January with well below average day-time temperatures but adequate night-time temperatures throughout the reproductive period (Figure 1). Well above average in-season rainfall of 352 mm was recorded with below average reference evapotranspiration of 1100 mm for the period 15 October–30 April.Figure 1. Maximum (red) and minimum (blue) temperatures and rainfall (bars) recorded in Year 1 (A) and Year 2 (B).Table 2. Monthly rainfall and daily average values of minimum and maximum temperature, solar radiation, and ET0 during the cropping seasons of 2020–2021 (Yr 1) and 2021–2022 (Yr 2) at Griffith, NSW [43].The study was conducted in a 9-bay, down-the-grade border check field (34 ha) (Figure 2). Each bay was 500–600 m long and 50–75 m wide (~3.5 ha each). Each bay was separated by 30 cm high earthen banks and individually connected to a water supply channel. Irrigation water into the field was measured by a Rubicon SlipMeter SMTM (NMI 14/3/62 certified) which is standard across rice farms in the region and averaged across the irrigation area. Irrigation water productivity (t/ML) was calculated: crop yield (t/ha) ÷ irrigation water (ML/ha) [11]. Total water productivity (t/ML) was calculated: crop yield (t/ha) ÷ (irrigation water (ML/ha) + rainfall (mm)) [11]. Drainage was collected at the opposite end of the supply channel and pumped into a recycle dam which was recycled in the same field.Figure 2. Location of the commercial field site where the 2-year study was conducted in relation to the Australian temperate rice region.2.2. Irrigation Treatments and Experimental LayoutThe experimental design was a randomised complete block design with three irrigation treatments thrice replicated in year 1 and two irrigation treatments replicated four times in year 2. The initial irrigation events of the season were based on agronomic decisions to ensure good establishment and weed control. After this, water management of the different treatments was based on soil moisture tension thresholds at 15 cm depth during the vegetative period—after establishment until panicle initiation (from mid-December until mid-January) with irrigation commencing when the treatment average threshold was reached. A depth of 15 cm was chosen as the majority of roots are concentrated in the top 10 cm [28]; however, cracking to a depth of 10 cm has commonly been observed in heavy clays in the region [31], reducing the reliability of soil moisture sensors. Irrigation thresholds of −15, −40 and −70 kPa were used in Year 1 and based on the results obtained, thresholds of −15 and −40 kPa were used in Year 2. These thresholds were chosen as they were considered minimal, mild and severe soil moisture deficits. In both years, once treatments reached the reproductive period and nitrogen was applied at panicle initiation, all treatments were irrigated every 2 to 3 days to ensure soil moisture did not surpass −10 kPa. Throughout the ripening stage, all treatments were irrigated to ensure soil tension did not surpass −15 kPa to ensure adequate moisture was available for grain filling.2.3. Soil Moisture Measurements and Water ManagementSoil moisture tension was monitored throughout the growing season in two bays per treatment in Year 1 and in all bays in Year 2 by means of two watermark sensors (Model 200SS, Irrometer Company Inc., Riverside, CA, USA) to enable averaging of readings to reduce uncertainty. Sensors were installed after establishment to ensure they were placed next to plants and provided representative readings of the soil tension at the root zone. In Year 1 the sensors were located in the middle of the bay and connected to low-cost, low-power WiField loggers that collect and store data periodically and upload to the Google Cloud platform through an on-farm WiFi network to enable real-time monitoring [44]. In Year 2, watermark sensors were connected to an all-in-one IoT communication station (SensorPro, Padman Automation, Strathmerton, VIC, Australia) located 100 m from the end of each bay. The IoT communication stations contained calibrated pressure transducers and capacitance sensors to sense and measure water height in each bay and in the supply channel. The solar-powered IoT sensors are periodically connected via the LoRaWAN gateway to send data to the Padman Automation webapp platform for real-time monitoring and irrigation control.Rubber lay-flat inserts were installed to existing concrete water stops which could be opened/closed by a winch cable. Portable self-powered AutowinchPro’s (Padman Automation, Strathmerton, VIC, Australia) were installed at the outlet to control irrigation events. The automated outlet controllers have a graphical user interface for programming at the device and communicated via LoRWAN to receive commands sent via the webapp. The webapp was used to ‘pair’ each SensorPro to the AutowichPro in each respective bay, as well as the subsequent bay to be irrigated. When predetermined water height thresholds were surpassed (20 mm) near the end of each bay, outlet controller commands were triggered to open/close respective outlets.2.4. Crop ManagementWheaten hay was cut and bailed prior to sowing in Year 1. Medium grain short season semi-dwarf variety, Viand was drill sown into an undisturbed seedbed at 130 kg/ha with 140 kg/ha Granulock Z starter fertilizer on 7 November 2020. The first three irrigation events were conducted manually prior to the installation of automation infrastructure. The timing of the first three irrigation events was based on herbicide and agronomic requirements to ensure good establishment. Crop establishment in all treatments averaged 187 (±49) plants/m2 with no significant difference between treatments. The pre-emergent (first) irrigation occurred 9–12 November with all treatments receiving a second irrigation on 20–21 November and a third irrigation on 3–5 December before irrigation treatments were imposed (Figure 3).Figure 3. Irrigation management at the different crop growth stages.After the Year 1 harvest, the field was left fallow in the winter of 2021 before rice stubble was burnt in early October and the land was re-levelled prior to planting to overcome wheel track compaction from previous operations. Viand was once again drill sown two weeks earlier than the first year, at a reduced rate of 120 kg/ha with 140 kg/ha Granulock Z starter fertiliser on 20 October, 2021. Based on the delay in maturity seen by increasing soil moisture deficit in Year 1, the date of the pre-emergent irrigation after sowing was staggered in an attempt to have both treatments reaching PI at the same time. The 40 kPa treatment received its pre-emergent irrigation on 22 October and second irrigation on 30 October while the pre-emergent irrigation for the 15 kPa treatment occurred on 31 October, prior to substantial rainfall throughout November and early December. Plant establishment did not differ between treatments to an average of 151(±19) plants/m2. Both treatments received irrigation on 15-16 December prior to the deficit irrigation treatments being imposed (Figure 3).In both years all irrigation treatments received a thrice split N regime in the form of granular urea (46% N). A total of 220 kg/ha N was applied based on the requirements to achieve a high yield (>10 t/ha) for this soil type in the region factoring in higher N losses than normal due to the continued wetting and drying of the soil. To reduce N losses when broadcasting, urea should be applied to dry soil just prior to an irrigation event, and therefore, the timing of irrigation dictated when nitrogen was applied.In both years, weeds were successfully controlled by the farm manager using commercially available herbicides applied prior to an irrigation event. In Year 1 post-sowing and pre-rice emergence a combination of Paraquat 250 g/L (1 L/ha) and clomazone 480 g/L (0.5 L/ha). Post-rice emergence, dicamba 500 g/L (0.5 L/ha) and pendimethalin 440 g/L (3 L/ha) was applied. Cyhalofop butyl 160 g/L, 12 g/L Florpyrauxifen-Benzyl and 350 g/L N,N-Dimethyloctanamide and N,N-Dimethyldecanmide (2 L/ha) was applied at the time irrigation treatments commenced. In Year 2 post sowing and pre-rice emergence a combination of clomazone 480 g/L (0.5 L/ha) and pendimethalin 440 g/L (3 L/ha) was applied. Post-emergence, Cyhalofop butyl 160 g/L, 12 g/L Florpyrauxifen-Benzyl and 350 g.L N,N-Dimethyloctanamide and N,N-Dimethyldecanmide (2 L/ha) was applied at the time irrigation treatments commenced.2.5. Crop MeasurementsPlant samples (3 × 0.2 m2 at the top, middle and bottom of each bay) for biomass and nitrogen uptake were taken at panicle initiation and analysed for N uptake using NIR spectroscopy [45]. Four above-ground plant samples (1 m2) per replicate were collected at physiological maturity and dried at 80 °C until a constant weight to determine the total dry matter with panicles counted to determine panicles/m2. Samples were threshed through a stationary thresher and the grain was weighed to determine the harvest index. 1000 grain samples were counted and weighed. Grain yield was estimated from an area of 1–1.8 ha (harvested with a commercial combine harvester on April 29 for the 15 kPa and May 21 for the 40 and 70 kPa treatments in Year 1 and on March 24 for both treatments in Year 2) and reported at 14% moisture. Crop phenology was monitored in each replicate to accurately determine the timing of PI and anthesis. PI was declared when the panicle could be identified with the naked eye in three out of 10 tillers [46]. Anthesis was declared when an estimated 50% of anthers on 50% of panicles within the replicate was achieved.2.6. Statistical AnalysisStatistical analysis consisted of a quantile-quantile plot to test for normality and analysis of variance in R. Differences between means were compared by least-significant difference (LSD) tests at a 5% probability level.3. Results3.1. Water ManagementDuring the period when the deficit irrigation treatments were enforced in Year 1, the 15 kPa treatment reached its threshold and was irrigated on four occasions. The 40 kPa treatment reached its threshold and was irrigated on three occasions during this period and the 70 kPa twice (Figure 4). An irrigation event in each treatment during this period can be detected in Figure 4 by a sharp increase in soil moisture tension (less negative values) with readings returning to values ≥ −10 kPa indicative of saturated soil.Figure 4. Soil moisture tension during the vegetative period when irrigation scheduling treatments were enforced; (A): Year 1 (above), (B): Year 2 (below), 15 kPa (green), 40 kPa (blue), 70 kPa.Upon reaching irrigation thresholds in the vegetative period, visual symptoms of moisture stress including leaf rolling and colouring to blue were observed in the 40 and 70 kPa treatments. The symptoms were more pronounced in the 70 kPa treatment; however, both treatments recovered immediately following irrigation. Visual plant moisture stress was not observed in the 15 kPa treatments during the vegetative period.Increasing soil moisture deficit in the vegetative period delayed crop development, and therefore, during the reproductive period the 40 kPa treatment received five more irrigations than the 15 kPa treatment, and the 70 kPa treatment received six more than the 15 kPa treatment (Table 3). It must be noted that substantial runoff occurred in Year 2 due to extreme rainfall events with useful rainfall likely much less than the total in-season rainfall. Soil moisture did not exceed −10 kPa during this period, as seen in Figure 4. During grain ripening the 40 and 70 kPa treatments were irrigated three times and the 15 kPa treatment received four irrigations. In total for Year 1, the 15 kPa treatment received 30 irrigations, with the 40 and 70 kPa treatments both receiving an extra three irrigations due to the early season soil moisture deficit causing a delay in plant maturity and extending the growing season. A total of 7.95 ML/ha irrigation water was applied in Year 1.Table 3. Number of irrigation events during various growth stages in both years.In Year 2, the 15 kPa treatment received two irrigations during establishment and the 40 kPa received three due to the earlier pre-emergent irrigation date. From 22 December until 5 January the 15 kPa treatment reached its threshold and was irrigated on three occasions with the 40 kPa treatment reaching its threshold and irrigated on two occasions (Figure 4). Significant rainfall events occurred from January 6 to 15 with irrigation not commencing again until 20 January. By this stage, both treatments had reached PI and were irrigated 15 times until the end of anthesis with soil moisture not exceeding −10 kPa. A further three irrigations occurred during ripening. The total number of irrigations for the 15 and 40 kPa treatments in Year 2 was 23 with a total of 4.65 ML/ha irrigation water applied, much less than in Year 1 due to the increased rainfall received. It must be noted that substantial runoff occurred in Year 2 due to extreme rainfall events with useful rainfall much less likely than the total in-season rainfall.3.2. Crop Phenology and N UptakeIncreasing soil moisture deficit between irrigations in the vegetative period in Year 1 had a significant impact on rice physiological development. Relative to the 15 kPa treatment, the number of days from pre-emergent irrigation until PI was 13 and 17 days longer in the 40 and 70 kPa treatments, respectively, with time to anthesis occurring 10 and 15 days later than the 15 kPa treatment (Figure 5, Table 4).Figure 5. Long-term mean (21 years) maximum and minimum temperatures (dashed red/blue line, respectively) and maximum and minimum temperatures recorded [43] (solid red/blue line, respectively) in Year 1 (A) and Year 2 (B) with dotted dark blue line at 17 °C to show the critical minimum temperature for rice during early pollen microspore and anthesis. Square dots represent date of panicle initiation with triangles representing anthesis (blue: 15 kPa, green: 40 kPa, brown: 70 kPa treatments).Table 4. Rice establishment, nitrogen uptake and crop development results for Year 1 and Year 2. Values ± standard deviation with different letters between rows indicating statistical significance at 0.05.In Year 2, relative to the 15 kPa treatment, the number of days from pre-emergent irrigation until PI was 14 days longer for the 40 kPa treatment, with anthesis delayed by 12 days. Consequently, delaying pre-emergent irrigation for the 15 kPa treatment meant both treatments reached PI within 4–5 days of each other (Figure 5, Table 4).No statistically significant differences in plant N uptake were recorded at either sampling date in Year 1 among treatments, averaging 68 kg N/ha on January 18 (prior to final N application) and 130 kg N/ha on February 3, respectively. In Year 2 on January 16 prior to the final N application, the total N uptake averaged 107 kg/ha with no statistically significant differences between treatments.3.3. Grain Yield & Water ProductivityIrrigation treatment affected grain yield in Year 1 (Table 5). The 15 kPa treatment yielded significantly more (4.5 t/ha) than the 70 kPa treatment. However, no statistically significant differences were observed between the intermediate treatment (40 kPa) and the other two treatments. Irrigated water productivity and total water productivity (irrigation and rainfall) for the 15 kPa treatment (1.02 t/ML and 0.84 t/ML, respectively) were significantly greater than in the 70 kPa treatment (0.45 t/ML and 0.37 t/ML, respectfully). No yield difference between the 15 kPa and 40 kPa treatments was observed in Year 2 (Table 5) with irrigated water productivity of 1.62 t/ML and total water productivity of 0.92 t/ML.Table 5. Grain yield, yield components and water productivity for Year 1 and Year 2. Values ± standard deviation with different letters between rows indicating statistical significance at 0.05.Conversely, for the yield in Year 1, plant dry matter at physiological maturity in the 70 kPa treatment was significantly greater than in the 15 kPa treatment with no statistically significant differences found between the 15 and 40 kPa treatments in either year. The harvest index of the 15 kPa treatment was significantly higher than both the 40 and 70 kPa treatments in Year 1 with no difference between treatments in Year 2. One thousand grain weight did not differ between treatments in either year, averaging 21.5 g in Year 1 and 21.7 g in Year 2.4. Discussion4.1. Quantificaiton of the Delay in Physiological DevelopmentQuantification of the maturity delay associated with soil moisture deficit is required to determine optimal sowing windows and irrigation scheduling. This can provide farmers and future researchers with irrigation recommendations to manage water to avoid unfavourable growing conditions during sensitive growth periods and maximise water productivity. Research in water-saving rice has generally assessed the delay in crop development in relation to the frequency of irrigation rather than to the soil moisture deficit imposed [28,29,30].

However, the impact of such measures on rice yield and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, especially nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, needs to be further clarified to ensure that agronomic practices save water, conserve soil, and reduce GHG emissions. Therefore, we explored the effects of mild AWD irrigation combined with on-site rice straw recycling on N2O emissions and rice yield through rice pot experiments. This experiment included 2 irrigation methods (continuous flooding (CF) irrigation and mild AWD irrigation), 2 nitrogen (N) application levels (0 and 225kgNha−1) and 2 rice straw return levels (0 and 9000kgha−1), for a total of 10 treatments, and each treatment had 3 replicates. The 15N-urea and 15N-S were added to the soil. The results showed that N2O emissions were primarily affected by urea application and irrigation methods, with urea application being most important. Compared with CF irrigation, mild AWD irrigation increased cumulative N2O emissions, with an average increase of 28.8%. In addition, adding rice straw to mild AWD irrigation further stimulated N2O emissions by 18.1%. Under the condition of urea application, compared with CF irrigation, mild AWD irrigation increased the yield-scaled N2O emissions by 17.9%, and the addition of rice straw further promoted the yield-scaled N2O emissions under mild AWD irrigation by 17.4% but reduced the global warming potential (GWP) (methane (CH4)+N2O) by 62.9%. Under the condition of urea application, compared with CF irrigation, mild AWD irrigation reduced the uptake of soil-derived N and aboveground biomass of rice but did not reduce rice yield. Therefore, mild AWD irrigation combined with rice straw return may be a promising agronomic method to maintain rice yield, reduce GHGs, and protect or improve soil fertility.Download & linksArticle (2197 KB)Full-text XMLSupplement (329 KB)BibTeXEndNoteShareHow to cite.

More than 135×106ha of rice are cultivated worldwide, and approximately 90% of paddy fields are submerged (J. Wang et al., 2017). Feeding a growing population under water scarcity will be a major challenge to Asia's food security in the coming decades (Lampayan et al., 2015). In China, more than 60% of freshwater resources are consumed by rice cultivation every year, which represents a great waste of freshwater and causes many environmental problems, such as nonpoint source pollution, eutrophication, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Liao et al., 2020). Therefore, it is urgent to explore new methods for managing paddy field fertilization that can ensure high rice yield and reduced water waste and pollution.Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation is an effective water-conserving irrigation method that can save approximately 23% of freshwater resources compared with CF irrigation (Bouman and Tuong, 2001; Chu et al., 2014). There are usually two approaches to AWD irrigation: severe AWD irrigation (soil water potentialkPa) and mild AWD irrigation (soil water potentialkPa) (Zhou et al., 2017). Severe AWD irrigation could reduce rice yield by 22.6% due to water stress, but under mild AWD irrigation, rice yield can be stable or slightly increased (Carrijo et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2017). Therefore, mild AWD irrigation may offer a more promising paddy field management model. Previous studies have shown that AWD irrigation can significantly reduce CH4 emissions but considerably promotes N2O emissions, while global warming potential (GWP) mitigation is dependent on the magnitude of the increase in the release of N2O (Lagomarsino et al., 2016; Liang et al., 2017; Kritee et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2018). Therefore, exploring the impact of mild AWD irrigation on GHG emissions, especially N2O, is conducive to reducing paddy field emissions and maximizing agricultural and environmental benefits.Long-term cultivation without organic matter supplementation leads to serious degradation of cultivated land and reduction in soil organic matter (SOM) content (Zhou et al., 2021), which is not conducive to rice production and sustainable agricultural development (Chen et al., 2016). Straw (S) return to the field is a valuable measure for improving SOM (Huang et al., 2021), and it is beneficial for reducing the environmental pollution caused by burning straw or discarding it randomly (Wang et al., 2018). In addition, rice straw return may cause changes in paddy field GHG emissions (Naser et al., 2007; Ye and Horwath, 2017; Sun et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2021), N-use efficiency (Liu et al., 2021), and rice yield (Chen et al., 2016; Ku et al., 2019). Although there have been many studies on mild paddy AWD irrigation or rice straw return, few studies have focused on the effects of mild AWD irrigation combined with rice straw return on rice cultivation. Under the conventional fertilization mode, whether mild AWD irrigation combined with rice straw return can achieve the optimal goals of water saving, yield increase and reduction in GHG emissions has remained unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of mild AWD irrigation combined with rice straw return on N2O emissions and rice yield in rice cultivation and to explore the supply of N to rice growth from the soil, urea and rice straw using 15N labeling technology. Our initial hypotheses were as follows: (1) mild AWD irrigation would promote N2O emissions in rice cultivation; and (2) mild AWD irrigation would maintain or promote rice yield.2Materials and methods2.1Experimental setupA pot experiment was conducted in an open greenhouse at the Shenyang Experimental Station of the Institute of Applied Ecology, Liaoning Province, China (43∘32′N, 123∘23′E) from 17 June to 27 October 2020. The test soil was an Alfisol with a total C content of 16.01gkg−1 and a total N content of 1.36gkg−1.The pot experiment used a random block design, including 30 pots (30cm diameter×20cm height). This experiment included two irrigation methods, two N application levels and two rice straw return levels, with three replicates of each combination, for a total of 30 rice pots (urea and straw were labeled with 15N, respectively). The two irrigation methods were continuous flooding (CF) irrigation and mild AWD irrigation. The CF irrigation maintained a water level depth of approximately 3–5cm throughout the rice-growing season. Mild AWD irrigation water management in the first 7d was consistent with CF irrigation and was allowed to evaporate under monitoring; when the soil negative pressure gauge reached −15kPa, it was sub-flooded to a depth of 3–5cm again and was then naturally allowed to dry again. This step was repeated until harvest. The CF and mild AWD irrigation were halted 2 weeks before harvest. Nitrogen was applied at 0kgNha−1 (control check (CK) and rice straw (15S)) and 225kgNha−1 (106.13mgkg−1 dry soil) (urea (15U), urea+rice straw (U15S) and urea+rice straw (15US)). The abundance of urea 15N was 10.20%. Urea was applied three times: base fertilizer 40% (17 June), tiller topdressing 30% (4 August) and heading topdressing 30% (25 August). Rice straw return was applied at 0kgha−1 (CK and 15U) and 9000kgha−1 (4.25gkg−1 dry soil) (15S, U15S and 15US). The total N content of unlabeled rice straw was 0.72%, and the isotope abundance of 15N was 0.59%. The total N content of labeled rice straw was 0.73%, and the 15N isotope abundance was 22.94%. The rice straw was ground and applied together with the base fertilizer. Phosphate fertilizer was superphosphate (150kgP2O5ha−1), and potassium fertilizer was potassium chloride (185kgK2Oha−1) as a one-time application of basic fertilizer. Every pot was filled with 10.51kg (9kg dry soil) of sieved (2mm) fresh soil. Two hills of rice were planted in each pot. At maturity, the rice yield and aboveground biomass were recorded after being oven-dried (105∘C for 0.5h and 60∘C for 12h).2.2Soil sample collection and analysisAt the stages of regreening, tillering, jointing, booting, filling and maturity, five points were randomly selected from the 0–10cm soil layer of each pot and mixed. The soil NH-N and NO-N were extracted with 2molL−1 KCl solution (Wu et al., 2019), filtered and analyzed with a continuous flow analyzer (AA3, Bran+Luebbe, Germany). The extraction of soil 15N-NH-N followed Yu et al. (2020). Soil microbial biomass N (MBN) was fumigated with chloroform, extracted with 0.5molL−1 K2SO4 (soil:solution=5g:20mL) (Joergensen and Mueller, 1996), and determined by a total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer (Elementar vario TOC Analyzer, Germany). The soil 15N-NH-N content, 15N-MBN and 15N of rice aboveground biomass were determined by a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (253 MAT, Thermo Finnigan, Germany).2.3Gas sampling and calculationThe static chamber method was used to determine the N2O flux (J. L. Li et al., 2018). The static chamber with a top seal made of transparent plexiglass consisted of two parts, namely, the base and the gas-collecting chamber. The base had a diameter of 31cm, a groove in the middle, and a height of 10cm. The gas-collecting chamber had a diameter of 30cm with a height of 70cm. A small fan and a thermometer were installed in the gas-collecting chamber. Nitrous oxide (N2O) was collected every 2d in the first week after fertilization or irrigation and every 7d during other periods; N2O was sampled at 08:00–11:00LT each sampling day. Every pot was sealed with water when N2O was collected. Three gas samples were collected at 0, 30 and 60min after the chamber was airtight, and N2O was collected with a 50mL injector and then injected into 200mL gasbags.The N2O concentration was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890B, Gas Chromatograph, Delaware, USA). The calculation of N2O fluxes was as follows (J. L. Li et al., 2018):where F is the N2O flux (µgm−2h−1); ρ is the N2O standard-state density (1.964kgm−3); h is the chamber height above the soil (m); c is the N2O concentration;is the slope of the N2O concentration curve, estimated using a linear regression model (Vitale et al., 2017); 273 is the gas constant; and T is the average air temperature inside the chamber during N2O collection (∘C).Cumulative N2O emissions (CE) were calculated using the following formula according to Wang et al. (2011):where i is the various sampling times, t is the sampling date, n is the total measurement time and 10−2 is the conversion factor.The contribution of 15N markers to NH-N and MBN as well as the calculation of the N source of the aboveground biomass of rice followed Ma et al. (2015). Yield-scaled N2O was calculated as the ratio between N2O and rice yield (J. L. Li et al., 2018).2.4Statistical analysisAll analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics 16.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, USA). One-way ANOVA was conducted to test the treatment effects with Duncan's test. Significance was set at P<0.05. Univariate analysis of variance was used to analyze the response of cumulative N2O emissions to irrigation method, N level and rice straw application (Table 2). Tables and figures were prepared with Excel 2016 (Microsoft Corp., USA) and Origin 8 (Origin Lab Corp., USA), respectively. The data in the figures and tables are the average value ±standard error.3Results3.1N2O fluxThree higher N2O flux peaks appeared after basal fertilizer and two topdressing treatments (Fig. 1), and the N2O flux peak after basal fertilizer application was significantly larger than the last two peaks. After basal fertilizer was applied, the N2O flux peaks of CF irrigation and mild AWD irrigation were similar. After the first topdressing, the N2O flux peak of mild AWD irrigation was significantly greater than that of CF irrigation, approximately 1.4 and 9.1 times under the U and US treatments, respectively. In contrast, the N2O flux peak of CF irrigation after the second topdressing was 3.5 and 1.6 times higher than that of mild AWD irrigation under the U and US treatments, respectively. In addition to the above three peaks, the N2O flux of CF irrigation was close to zero, and mild AWD irrigation had a lower flux peak with alternating wet and dry conditions. The flux of N2O ranged from −103.93 to 2770.50µgm−2h−1. The N2O flux appeared negative in the late stage of rice growth. The N2O fluxes of CF irrigation and mild AWD irrigation were similar in the later stage of rice growth, indicating that drainage had little effect on it. During the entire rice growth cycle, the N2O flux of the CK and S treatments was low. There were significant differences in the peak N2O fluxes between the different treatments. Compared with CK, the application of S alone significantly promoted the N2O flux on the first day after CF irrigation and mild AWD irrigation. Compared with U, the addition of S in CF irrigation reduced the N2O flux, while the addition of S in mild AWD irrigation increased the N2O flux.Figure 1Effects of different treatments on nitrous oxide (N2O) flux. Bars represent standard errors (n=3), the same below.Download3.2Soil NH-N, NO-N and MBN concentrationsThe soil NH-N, NO-N, and MBN concentrations varied with the growing stage of rice (Figs. 2a, c and 3a). The soil NH-N concentration first increased and then decreased. The NH-N concentration under CF irrigation and mild AWD irrigation was low in the late rice growth period (Fig. 2a). The concentration of NO-N in CF-irrigated soil showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing and was at a low level in the later growth period of rice, while the concentration of NO-N in mild AWD irrigation showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing, with repeated decreases and increases (Fig. 2c). The concentration of MBN in CF-irrigated soil first decreased and then increased and then decreased to a lower level, while the concentration of MBN in mild AWD-irrigated soil decreased with the growth stage of rice (Fig. 3a).Figure 2Changes in soil ammonium nitrogen (NH-N) concentration (a), the contribution of 15N markers to NH-N (b), and changes in soil nitrate nitrogen (NO-N) concentration (c) during the growth period of rice (n=3).DownloadFigure 3Changes in the concentration of microbial biomass N (MBN) (a) in the soil during the growth period of rice and the contribution of 15N markers to MBN (b) (n=3).DownloadThere were significant differences in the NH-N, NO-N, and MBN concentrations between the different treatments. In CF irrigation and mild AWD irrigation, the U treatment had a higher NH-N concentration in the early stage of rice growth, while the other treatments had no significant difference, but as rice grew, the NH-N concentration of the US treatment increased, which was significantly greater than that of the U, S and CK treatments (Fig. 2a). In CF irrigation, the NO-N concentration of the U treatment was slightly higher than that of the other treatments, and all treatments had little variance. In mild AWD irrigation, the NO-N concentration of the US treatment was significantly higher than that of the U, S and CK treatments. The U treatment had a higher NO-N concentration than the S and CK treatments in the later stage of rice growth (Fig. 2c). The US treatment in CF irrigation and mild AWD irrigation had the highest MBN concentration during the growth period of rice (Fig. 3a).Figure 2b shows that the NH-N in CF irrigation and mild AWD irrigation mainly came from urea rather than rice straw, and the combined application of urea and rice straw further promoted the release of NH-N from urea. Regardless of CF irrigation or mild AWD irrigation, rice straw N was difficult to utilize by microorganisms in the first year under single rice straw application, but the combined application of rice straw and urea significantly promoted the utilization of rice straw N by microorganisms. The application of urea combined with rice straw may be more easily utilized by microorganisms than urea applied alone (Fig. 3b).3.3Sources of aboveground biomass N in riceAs shown in Fig. 4, under CF irrigation and mild AWD irrigation, compared with CK, a single application of rice straw did not increase the aboveground N absorption of rice, while the U and US treatments significantly promoted the aboveground N absorption of rice. Under mild AWD irrigation, the US treatment reduced N uptake in rice shoots compared with the U treatment. The U and US treatments under CF irrigation promoted the N uptake of the aboveground rice more than those under mild AWD irrigation.Figure 4The source of nitrogen in the aboveground biomass of rice at the maturity stage (n=3). CF: continuous flooding irrigation, AWD: mild alternate wetting and drying irrigation, Soil-N: soil-derived nitrogen, U-N: urea-derived nitrogen, S-N: Rice straw-derived nitrogen. Different capital letters indicate significant differences in total nitrogen uptake of rice above ground (P<0.05), and different lowercase letters indicate significant differences in soil-nitrogen supply (P<0.05).DownloadWith different irrigation methods, the effects of urea and rice straw addition on the N absorption of the aboveground rice were varied. Compared with the CK and S treatments, the U and US treatments under CF irrigation significantly promoted the absorption of soil-N by rice, while only the S and U treatments had significant differences under mild AWD irrigation. Compared with mild AWD irrigation, the U and US treatments under CF irrigation significantly promoted the absorption of soil-N by rice. Regardless of the irrigation and fertilization method, the soil was the main source of N in the aboveground parts of rice, followed by urea and finally rice straw (Fig. 4).3.4Cumulative N2O emissions, rice agronomic properties and yield-scaled N2O emissionsIn addition to the CK treatment, compared with CF irrigation, mild AWD irrigation significantly promoted the accumulation of N2O during the growth period of rice, with an average increase of 28.8% (Table 1). Under CF irrigation, there was no significant difference in the accumulation of N2O between S and CK or between US and U. However, the addition of rice straw under mild AWD irrigation significantly increased the accumulation of N2O by 18.1% (Table 1). Compared with the CK and S treatments, the U and US treatments significantly promoted cumulative N2O emissions under the two irrigation modes. As shown in Table 2, irrigation methods, N application level, and rice straw return affected cumulative N2O emissions, of which the N application level had the greatest impact. The interaction between irrigation level and N fertilizer or rice straw significantly affected cumulative N2O emissions.Table 1Effects of different treatments on cumulative nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, rice aboveground biomass, rice yield and yield-scaled N2O emissions. The values denote means±standard errors (n=3). Different lowercase letters indicate significant differences (P<0.05).Download Print Version | Download XLSXAs shown in Table 1, compared with CF irrigation, mild AWD irrigation significantly reduced rice aboveground biomass under US treatment but had no effect on other treatments. Regardless of whether CF irrigation or mild AWD irrigation was applied, there was no significant difference in the rice aboveground biomass between S and CK or between US and U. Compared with the CK and S treatments, the U and US treatments significantly promoted the rice aboveground biomass under the two irrigation modes. Irrigation level had no effect on rice yield under all treatments. Regardless of CF irrigation or mild AWD irrigation, rice yield under the U and US treatments was significantly higher than that under the CK and S treatments, but there was no difference between the former two and the latter two.In addition to the CK treatment, compared with CF irrigation, mild AWD irrigation significantly promoted yield-scaled N2O emissions during the rice growth period. Under urea application conditions, compared with CF irrigation, mild AWD irrigation increased yield-scale N2O emissions by 17.9%, and the addition of rice straw further promoted yield-scale N2O emissions by 17.4% under mild AWD irrigation conditions (Table 1). Regardless of CF irrigation or mild AWD irrigation, yield-scaled N2O emissions under the U and US treatments were significantly higher than those under the CK and S treatments. Rice straw addition had no effect on the yield-scaled N2O emissions under CF irrigation but significantly increased the yield-scaled N2O emissions under mild AWD irrigation.4Discussion4.1Effects of irrigation methods, N levels and rice straw return on N2O emissionsN2O emissions are significantly affected by water-filled pores and mineral N (NH-N and NO-N) content (Allen et al., 2010). The N2O emission peak in CF irrigation occurred only after N application, while mild AWD irrigation caused other N2O emission peaks, which might have been caused by the change in soil moisture conditions by mild AWD irrigation (Zhou et al., 2020). The peak of N2O after fertilization may be because a large amount of N application increases the soil inorganic-N concentration (Fig. 2a and c), which in turn promotes the generation of N2O, which comes from the denitrification process (L. Wang et al., 2017; Yano et al., 2014). During the denitrification process, it is easier for microorganisms to use NO-N as an electron acceptor (Fig. 2c), which affects the reduction process of N2O, resulting in an increase in the ratio ofin the denitrification products (Pérez et al., 2000). Our results showed a negative N2O emission flux at the later stage of rice growth, which may be due to the decrease in surface soil N2O concentration due to the strengthening of the N2O reduction process or the weakening of the N2O diffusion process in the soil profile, which allowed atmospheric N2O to diffuse back into the soil (Chapuis-Lydie et al., 2007). Mild AWD irrigation promoted cumulative N2O emissions by 28.8% on average, which was as proposed in our Hypothesis 1. Similar results were found in previous studies, which may be due to the increased N2O produced by nitrification and denitrification due to water-level alternation (Liang et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2020) and temperature change (Wu et al., 2019) of mild AWD irrigation. To reduce N2O emissions from paddy fields, researchers generally regulate N2O production by optimizing N management (Liang et al., 2017), applying inhibitors to control the N supply rate of N fertilizers (Wu et al., 2019). In both CF and mild AWD irrigation, there was no obvious N2O emission peak at the later growth stage of rice, which may have been due to the decrease in soil inorganic-N content (Fig. 2a and c) and microbial biomass (Fig. 3a).Compared with CK and S, N fertilizer application (U and US) significantly increased cumulative N2O emissions and was the most notable factor in N2O generation (Table 2), mainly because N fertilizer application provided sufficient substrates for soil nitrification and denitrification to generate N2O (Fiedler et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2021). The peak of N2O emissions after base fertilizer application was larger than that after two topdressings, which might have been due to a higher N application rate and simultaneous nitrification and denitrification during the initial flooding (Mathieu et al., 2006; L. Wang et al., 2017). The peak of N2O emissions after the two topdressing treatments with CF irrigation was similar, while the peak of N2O emissions after the first topdressing treatment with mild AWD irrigation was significantly larger than that following the second topdressing treatment. This may be because the soil environment (temperature, moisture, etc.) changed little during long-term flooding under CF irrigation (Lagomarsino et al., 2016; Verhoeven et al., 2018; Congreves et al., 2019), while the variations in the soil environment of the two topdressings under mild AWD irrigation changed the utilization of fertilizer N by microorganisms (Fig. 3b). Therefore, reducing the amount of the first topdressing under mild AWD irrigation and maintaining flooding for approximately 1 week after fertilization may benefit N2O reduction (Liao et al., 2020). The negative value of N2O emissions appeared at the later stage of rice growth, indicating that the paddy field could also become a sink for N2O (van Groenigen et al., 2015), which might be caused by the lack of N supply at the later stage. Increasing the second topdressing might be beneficial for alleviating N deficiency (Liao et al., 2020).Table 2Cumulative nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in response to irrigation method, nitrogen level and straw returning. Significant treatment effects within a main category (P<0.05) were indicated by * and indicated significant treatment effects within a main category (P<0.001).Download Print Version | Download XLSXUnlike the CF irrigation, the addition of rice straw under mild AWD irrigation conditions promoted N2O emissions (Table 1), probably because the alternation of wet and dry conditions promoted the decomposition of rice straw (Andren et al., 1993; Buchen et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2016), which was beneficial to the growth of microorganisms (Fig. 3a), thus promoting the production of N2O (Said-Pullicino et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2021). In addition, compared with U and S, US promoted microbial absorption of urea and rice straw N (Fig. 3b), which also proved that US treatment was more conducive to the growth of microorganisms.4.2Effects of irrigation methods, N levels and rice straw return on rice production and yield-scaled N2O emissionsThe change in irrigation method did not cause differences in rice yield (Table 1), but under the US treatment, mild AWD irrigation significantly reduced the aboveground biomass of rice and the uptake of soil N by rice (Table 1 and Fig. 4), which was consistent with our Hypothesis 2. Previous studies have also shown that mild AWD irrigation can stabilize or increase rice yield. This may be because mild AWD irrigation can promote the transport of nutrients from stems and leaves to grains during the reproductive growth stage of rice while inhibiting ineffective tillering and increasing the number of effective panicles, thereby reducing excessive vegetative growth of rice (Carrijo et al., 2017; Z. Li et al., 2018; Liao et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2009). This may also be an important reason for the decrease in the uptake of soil N by rice under AWD irrigation. Urea application was a key factor in improving rice yield (J. Wang et al., 2017), but it also aggravated soil N uptake by rice, and soil was the largest source of N for rice in all treatments (Fig. 4). Compared with U, under CF irrigation and mild AWD irrigation, US reduced the uptake of soil-derived N by rice, and the trend was more obvious under mild AWD irrigation. Although the trend was not significant, rice straw return may be an effective way to maintain long-term soil fertility (Fig. 4).In our study, mild AWD irrigation, urea application and rice straw return all increased yield-scaled N2O emissions (Table 1), mainly due to improved soil aeration and increased inorganic N and rice straw decomposition, resulting in more N2O production (Andren et al., 1993; Buchen et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2016; Lagomarsino et al., 2016; Fiedler et al., 2017; Verhoeven et al., 2018; Congreves et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2021). Although mild AWD irrigation had higher yield-scaled N2O emissions than CF irrigation, the GWP (CH4+N2O) under mild AWD irrigation was significantly lower than that under CF irrigation and decreased by 8.1%, 57.9%, 11.8% and 62.9% under CK, S, U and US, respectively (Table S1 in the Supplement). Therefore, mild AWD irrigation combined with rice straw return may be a promising agronomic measure that maintains rice yield, slows greenhouse effects (CO2 emissions are not considered), and also reduces soil fertility consumption.5ConclusionsThe effects of irrigation methods, N levels and rice straw return on N2O emissions were explored through pot experiments using rice. We found that N2O emissions were affected by urea application and irrigation methods, with urea application being the most important. Compared with CF irrigation, mild AWD irrigation increased cumulative N2O emissions, with an average increase of 28.8%. In addition, adding rice straw to mild AWD irrigation further stimulated N2O emissions by 18.1%. Under the condition of urea application, compared with CF irrigation, mild AWD irrigation increased the yield-scaled N2O emissions by 17.9%, and the addition of rice straw further promoted the yield-scaled N2O emissions under mild AWD irrigation by 17.4% but reduced the GWP (CH4+N2O) by 62.9%. Under the condition of urea application, compared with CF irrigation, mild AWD irrigation reduced the uptake of soil-derived N and aboveground biomass of rice but did not reduce rice yield. Therefore, mild AWD irrigation combined with rice straw return may offer a promising agronomic measure to maintain high rice yield, reduce greenhouse effects, and maintain or improve soil fertility.Data availabilityThe data that support the findings of this study are available by request from the corresponding author (Lili Zhang).SupplementThe supplement related to this article is available online at: https://doi.org/10.5194/soil-8-645-2022-supplement.Author contributionsKW, WL, ZW and ZD conceived and designed the experiments; YM and NL performed the experiments; KW analyzed the data; KW and LZ wrote the paper and all authors approved submission of the paper.

We evaluated VRI technologies, considering their benefits, drawbacks, challenges, and the performance of Variable (VRI) versus Constant Rate Irrigation (CRI). Studies on VRI technologies have demonstrated significant promise in enhancing crop water productivity with reduced energy demands. Research findings indicate that these technologies have the potential to improve crop water productivity by an average of 20% compared to traditional irrigation methods, while simultaneously reducing energy consumption by approximately 18%. Evidence from studies of VRI supported that water saving of up to 50% can be achieved. However, it's essential to consider that adopting VRI involves higher initial costs due to precision irrigation equipment and infrastructure installation. Despite the upfront investment, the potential long-term advantages in terms of increased crop yields and water conservation may well justify these initial expenses. These technologies effectively mitigate water wastage and environmental pollution. They offer valuable solutions for irrigation scheduling, considering temporal and spatial variations in crop water requirements. The application uniformity of VRI was found to be equal to or greater than 90%. Additionally, VRI systems achieve at least comparable uniformity of irrigation to systems operating under CRI. This review synthesizes diverse information and lays the foundation for informed decision-making, future research, and the advancement of more efficient and environmentally conscious automated irrigation systems.Keywords: self-propelled irrigation systems, precision irrigation, variable rate irrigation, management zones, water application uniformity1.

The usage of sensors and networking unitsenable the optimal usage of irrigation resources, and is termed as precisionirrigation (PI). Thus, PI leverage an efficient solution to handle the scarcityof essential resources such as food, water, land units, and crop yields. Thus,farmers gets better returns in the market due to high production. However,in PI, the exchange of crop readings from sensor units to actuators are pro-cessed through open channels, that is, Internet. Thus, it open the doors formalicious intruders to deploy network and sensor-based attacks on PI-sensors,to drain the available resources, and battery power of sensor nodes in the net-work. This reduces the optimum and precise utilization of irrigation resources,low-yield crops and damaged crops in supply chain systems. This leads todissatisfaction among agriculture stakeholders such as quality control units,logistics, suppliers, and customers. Motivated from the above discussions, thesurvey presents the advantages of integrating blockchain (BC) with PI to handleissues pertaining to security, trust, and transactional payments among agricul-ture stakeholders. The survey is directed to achieve threefold objective- attackmodels and countermeasures in PI systems, integration of BC in PI to mitigateattack models, and research challenges in deploying BC in PI. To address thefirst objective, the survey proposes an in-depth comparative analysis of tradi-tional irrigation systems with PI, with discussions on attack models. To addressthe second objective, the survey proposes an integration model of BC with PIto secure IoT sensors, and maintain trust and transparency among stakehold-ers. Finally, the survey addresses the open research challenges of deploying BCin PI-based irrigation systems, and presents a case-study of AgriChain as anindustry ready-solution that envisions BC with PI ecosystem. Thus, the proposedsurvey acts as a roadmap for agriculture industry stakeholders, researchers, todeploy BC in IoT-based PI that leverages an efficient, robust, trust-worthy, andsecure ecosystem.Trans Emerging Tel Tech. 2020;e4059.wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/ett© 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.1 of 30https://doi.org/10.1002/ett.40592 of 30BODKHE et al.1INTRODUCTIONAgriculture industry plays a pivotal role in economic prosperity, sustainable growth, and maintaining globalgross-domestic product (GDP) of indicators of national growth.1 To sustain this national growth, the agriculture sectormeets the rising demands of food supply, resources, and land infrastructure, to match the supply curve of increasingpopulation. As per the report of the World Bank on agriculture and rural development,2 65% population of the worlddepends on agriculture sector, and productivity of global agricultural sector is predicted to increase by 1.75% annually tomeet requirements of approximately 10 billion people by 2050.3 The rise in world population is analyzed in Figure 1A.According to the report of the world bank, as shown in Figure 1B, the food demand is expected to rise by 35% globally, soefficient measures are required to increase quality of crop yields to ensure good returns and profits, as well as meet theglobal demand of food. According to the report by the global productivity index, the growth rate in agriculture produc-tivity is currently at 0.96%, which is expected to increase to 1.75% by 2050. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) isexpected to rise to 1.87 million by 2023, as shown in Figure 2.To meet the growing demands of productivity and to manage the existing resources judiciously, new innovations arerequired in agriculture sector, mainly in irrigation systems. The traditional irrigation systems require manual labor, andcontinuous monitoring of crops, so that they are not wasted. To ensure healthy crop yield, the crops requires cultivationwith accurate measurements of soil moisture, temperature, and humidity levels. As traditional methods are manual, soirrigation systems are deeply flawed with inaccurate measurements of above mentioned parameters. This directly effectthe crop health, and thus, reduce the yield. Moreover, lack of precise dosage of pesticides in soil, and inaccurate rate ofwater flow through inlets such as pipes and tube-wells in plantation fields, lead to low yield. In addition, in many areas,(B)(A)F I G U R E 1Year-wise population and crop growth: A, Worldwide growth in population4 and B, crop yield growth5F I G U R E 2Integration of blockchain with PI.6 PI, precisionirrigationBODKHE et al.3 of 30F I G U R E 3Role of ICT in agriculture and PA.10 ICT, information and communication technology; PA, precision agriculturedue to geographical fluctuations, farmers suffer through water scarcity, leading to barren lands that are not cultivable. Asper the report by World Health Organization, around 4% of world’s freshwater resources are required to serve 17% of theworld population. Thus, the scarcity of water resources and lack of fresh water imprints forces the population to consumeimpure water. Dumping of industrial waste and home waste which are nonbiodegradable also leads to water pollution.Thus, the agridomain society needs to automate existing manual irrigation systems to reduce burden on farmers andmanage resources optimally. Currently, the world population is around 7.2 billion and it is expected to rise to more than9 billion by 2050.7 The automated irrigation employ usage of information and communication technology (ICT) tools tomanage irrigation resources optimally.As indicated in aforementioned discussions, ICT tools in agriculture sector leverages high crop yields and opti-mal utilization of resources. With a shift toward smart and sustainable cities, the modern agriculture systems haveemployed Internet of things (IoT)-based sensors to ensure precise utilization of agriculture resources. The preciseusage in agridomain through IoT-based sensors is coined as precision agriculture (PA).8 PA is a collective ecosystemthat combines diverse technologies such as IoT, communication systems such as remote sensing (RS), geographicalinformation system (GIS), global positioning system (GPS), and wireless sensor network (WSN) to collect crop data.The crop data aggregated at servers are analyzed through data-driven analytics, to form real-time informed decisions.Thus, PA has a metamorphic impact of agriculture industry, and thus, mostly all sectors (private, government, pub-lic) are adopting PA-based solutions to resolve agriculture challenges.9-11 In PA, to focus on irrigation-based techniques,precision irrigation (PI) incorporates the usage of IoT-based sensors in farm lands connected via networking infras-tructures that communicate in open channels, that is, Internet. Thus, PI allows precise measurements of resourcesto yield higher crop outputs and improves the overall quality of PA. Figure 3 depicts the role of ICT in agricultureand PI.PI allows the accurate usage of agricultural and livestock management inputs such as pesticides, fertilizer, and seeds,resulting in minimization costs and improved crop yields. However, the crop readings data is exchanged between sensorsunits, IoT gateways, and actuators through open wireless channels. Moreover, the shared data is stored in centralizedservers, which is more vulnerable to security attacks. Any malicious attackers can form an informed attack on servers,sensor units, and actuators to gain access to unauthorized crop data. This can lead to disastrous results, as readings canbe modified by an adversary that results in crop wastage. Thus, although the rapid advancement through ICT has helpedfarmers to automate irrigation tasks, but it has also introduced concerns of security and privacy attacks by maliciousintruders. In addition, due to incorrect measurements, the crops are damaged, and farmers are not able to sell them tothe markets. In addition, such attacks hamper the overall supply chain operations among agriculture stakeholders suchas farmers, logistics, warehouse owners, suppliers, and customers, that leads to dissatisfaction due to substandard cropgoods being exchanged. Therefore, there is a need of decentralized ecosystem in such IoT-based PI irrigation system toallow for optimal utilization of existing resources.Due to wastage of food resources, the report by World Bank states that the count of undernourished people exceededfrom 804 million in 2016 to 821 million in 2017.2 Thus, in smart PA ecosystems, food security is of paramount importance.To ensure high quality of crop yields, optimal usage of irrigation resources, food supply food tracebility, mitigate waterwastage, quality reinforcements are required by quality control teams that follow safety procedures right from plantinga seed to consumption of the finished food product.12,13 To ensure the desired quality of food supplies, a secure, decen-tralized, trust, and reliable ecosystem is required. Blockchain (BC) can leverage a trust based security solution in PA, andcan support secure data exchange among sensor units in IoT-based PI through distributed cryptographical primitivesof key exchange, encryption of exchanged data, and signature-based algorithms. In addition, it facilitates an auditable,chronological, timestamped, and automated transactional payment ecosystem among agriculture industry stakeholders-farmers, logistics, government, and vendors through execution of smart contracts among participating entities. As thesensor readings are recorded in distributed blocks, they are immutable to changes by an adversary. The recorded data4 of 30BODKHE et al.is added by miners in the chain through distribute consensus, and the newly added block is reflected to all stakehold-ers, ensuring fairness and transparency in the chain. The transactional history of all stakeholders can be viewed throughsmart BC-enabled mobile applications that records each block transactions. Thus, the proposed survey focuses on theopportunities and the research challenges of adopting BC as a potential solution to agriculture sector, mainly in smart PIsystems governed via IoT-based sensor units.1.1MotivationAs per the report of CAGR, the market for PI was around USD 2.76 billion in year 2017 and is expected to increase with7.2% by 2023.6 Most of the traditional IoT-based PI ecosystems are inadequate to handle security attacks, and handle trustamong distributed stakeholders. Motivated from the aforementioned discussions, in this survey, we present an exhaustiveanalysis on different security attacks vectors in IoT-based PI ecosystems through a detailed taxonomy and present coun-termeasures to mitigate the same. We also highlights the advantages of integrating BC as a possible solution to ensuresecurity and trust based framework that mitigates the attack vectors through a proposed framework. It allows PI plays tomanage the irrigation resources correctly and manage correct water-levels to maintain a healthy crop yield. In addition,as supply chain systems are automated via smart contracts, the overall profitability of agriculture sector improves, leadingto high return of investment to the prospective stakeholders in the industry.1.2Literature review of existing surveysTzounis et al14 discussed in-depth survey on microprecision models to support smart farming on IoT nodes and stud-ied about optimizing the resource utilization with dual effects of maximizing profits and minimizing loss of food supplychains in agriculture. The survey, however, did not discuss about various technical specifications related to data han-dling and interoperability among nodes in the network. The attacks related to security and control are not discussedas well.15 Kamilaris et al16 discusses the various deep-learning technical spread over 40 articles in agricultural domainfocused on models, the agricultural datasets, and how data-cleaning and preprocessing techniques are employed fortraining datasets.Once the performance metrics are decided, discussion on deep-learning models along with performance indicatorsare discussed. The article fails to draw attention on in-depth analysis and insights of obtained results to solve variousagricultural models in a generic domain. The discussion also lacks on sustainable and automated farming techniquesemployed by deep-learning models. Authors in Reference 17 discussed a survey on integrating IoT protocol stack tocomprehend the data analytics frameworks in agriculture sector. IoT increases the operational efficiency to increaseproductivity of irrigation and data analytics improves the overall logistic handling. The article presents the open chal-lenges in adoption of various protocols in IoT to make it affordable for long scale deployments. However, the surveydid not present the various security attacks possible in IoT infrastructures while data moves through the network dueto lack of open-standards in IoT stack. Zhao et al18 presented a systematic literature network over agrifood chain man-agement over 71 publications and built a citation network using gephi to study the effects of using BC to ensure servicelevel agreements in the supply chain. The article also proposed the critical challenges of adopting BC in such systemsand future research directions. The article lacked a comprehensive discussion of integration of BC and smart contractsexecution to ensure data interoperability, trust and tracebility in the agrichain. Jha et al19 highlighted the importanceof automated agriculture monitoring to minimize human interventions for selection of fertilizers to increase fertilityof crops. Neural network techniques to provide cost-effective solutions are provided for classification and grading ofcrops. The survey also discusses usage of IoT monitoring and its implications on traditional irrigation approaches. Thesurvey, however, fails to address selection of suitable approaches based on pesticides control, irrigation measurements,and pollution control. In addition, a discussion on automated water recycling and waste management is missing fromthe survey.Vasconez et al20 presented the recent state of research on human-robot interactions (HRI) applications to mitigatethe manual labor requirements in agricultural activities and increase productivity in handling crop management andsafety issues to minimize accidents. The demarcation of human and machine interactions are clearly presented in thesurvey. However, the survey fails to address the flexibility and adaptability issues in HRI interactions. Thus, real-lifemodels and application scenarios to build HRI systems are not discussed due to lack of cooperative standards. SarcBODKHE et al.5 of 30et al21 focused on designing effective solutions for recycling agricultural waste with use of robotic technologies. Thesurvey focused on four domains- waste collection, logistics, automated waste treatment, and data tools. Emphasis ofmixed waste is also highlighted in the survey. The survey lacks in discussing about IoT integration and physical mod-els to support waste management in irrigation systems. Authors in Reference 22 talks about PI systems employingIoT nodes to remotely monitor and manage agriculture activities. Discussion on the sensors and communication pro-tocols are presented for control and decision-making in PI. The survey lacks the discussion of security attacks in IoTbased PI infrastructure. Kamble et al23 highlighted recent trends and research over data-driven agrifood supply chaindepends on the comprehensive review of 84 articles and identified gaps in achieving sustainable standards for datacollection and deployment. The survey did not present the possible interactions of various components while dealingwith data.1.3Scope of this surveyThe surveys that are published till date by various researchers highlighted many aspects of smart agriculture systemsand PI, but mainly focused on the study of IoT protocols, communication standards, data analytics to improve logis-tics and decide key attributes of complex interrelated data, or on various application scenarios of irrigation systems. Fewsurveys are focused on usage of BC in agrichains to improve auditability, security, and asset-tracking between variousstakeholders in the supply chain. The proposed survey addresses the gap in earlier surveys as it provides a compre-hensive solution on the integration of BC in IoT-based PI ecosystems along-with research challenges in BC adoptionto the agriculture industry. To identify the pitfalls in earlier published surveys till-date, the authors have included areview method section that forms quality screening questions that investigate the advantages and merits of BC-adoptionin smart PI ecosystems. Based on the research questions, the survey presents a proposed BC-based PI framework thatcan address the issues of security attacks and trust among agriculture ecosystems. The proposed survey also focuses onthe possible security attacks and their countermeasures in the irrigation system with data analytics handled at differ-ent points in the network. In addition, to validate the merits of adopting BC, a case-study PI-Chain is presented thathandles how BC interacts with sensor units in an actual PI-ecosystem, while ensuring data analytics handling at vari-ous points in the network. Table 1 depicts a comparative summary of the existing literature surveys with the proposedsurvey article.1.4ContributionsFollowing are major research contributions of this article.• A detailed and comprehensive taxonomy of security attacks in PI-based irrigation systems based on attackers objectiveis presented.• Based on attack taxonomy, in depth investigation of attack countermeasures and security solutions with BC adoptionin IoT-based PI ecosystems is presented.

Due to limited sources of water, scarcity of water is a major concern. Watermanagement is widely recognized as a critical issue in the agricultural sector.27 Authors in Reference 28 discussed thatabout 70% of the existing fresh water is polluted in course of a decade, which is now being used for the agriculture sector.Panchard et al29 estimated that in developing countries, about 40% to 45% of the fresh-water which is used for agricultureis lost due to various reasons such as spills, evaporation, or absorption by the soil.30 So, water management is one of theprime concern in every crop systems. As water is getting more scarce, many farmers, and government associations arevery conscious about proper utilization of water. In the last four decades, various traditional microirrigation techniquessuch as drip irrigation, sprinkler, and so on were developed worldwide, but are not enough to resolve the aforementionedissues.29It is also observed that farmers suffer huge financial losses (which affects on GDP) due to inconvenient irrigationmethods and wrong prediction of weather and rain by the meteorological department.27,31 To prevent the misuse ofwater, smart irrigation systems are required that can help farmers to optimize water resource (Figure 6). Accurate andprecise irrigation techniques are necessary so that amount of water can be optimally utilized and wastage of water ismitigated.33,34PI is a precision activity which involves the accurate assessment of the crop water requirements and the precise appli-cation of this volume at the required time.35 It has a capability to increase the water use and economic efficiency’s bymatching irrigation inputs to yields in each area of a field. It also reduces cost of inputs results and increases the yield forthe same inputs. Crop yields are improved through proper gathering and maintaining of information of the crop and field.It has benefits such as reduction in water use, improvement in the crop yields, minimizing cost of inputs, and reductionin risk. Authors in References 36-39 applied ICT-based techniques such as RS, GIS, GPS, and WSN in irrigation systems toenhance irrigation system and agricultural water management system efficiency’s. PI has various number of advantagessuch as (i) Efficient water utilization is possible through PI, (ii) PI increases efficiency and production of crops in agricul-tural, (iii) PI reduces the adverse ', 'unique_identifier': 232}\n",

The study aims to predict soil moisture and, as such, the need for irrigation, using nonlinear mathematical models, describing the relationship between RGB and HSL colour model components and soil moisture and temperature. Nonlinear mathematical models used in the study are based on piecewise linear regression with breakpoint and soil moisture prediction using colour components and soil temperature with a deviation of +-6%. A system for automated irrigation was created and its control program was made, the basic control law of which is based on non-linear piecewise linear models. The automated irrigation management system includes a remote crop monitoring subsystem and an irrigation management subsystem. The program processes the photo received from the camera and activates the actuators when watering is needed. Compared to manual data collection in the first part of the study, the program calculates the average RGB model values from images in the studied row of tomato plantations with an accuracy of over 99% for the R and G components and over 92% for the B component. The program also predicts soil moisture with 98% accuracy. The practical significance of the water-saving efforts of this study lies in the development of a program-controlled automated irrigation system that utilizes plants as biological sensors, employing nonlinear mathematical models based on leaf colour changes to accurately predict soil moistureKeywords:biosensors; precision irrigation; RGB colourimetry; image processing; digitalization; bioinformaticshttps://doi.org/10.48077/scihor1.2024.127Retrieved from Vol. 27, No. 1, 2024Pages 127-139Share147 Views READ ARTICLEREFERENCESSUGGESTED CITATIONReferences[1] Araújo-Paredes, C., Portela, F., Mendes, S., & Valín, M.I.

This study aims to examine the spatiotemporal patterns of ET0 and facilitate the monitoring of crop water demand, optimize irrigation water usage, and enhance agricultural advisory services. This paper estimates regional-level daily ET0 gridded data with a spatial resolution of 12.5 km by integrating observed weather data, IMD GFS-T1534 reanalysis data, and INSAT-3D satellite-based insolation product using the standard FAO56 Penman–Monteith empirical equation. The estimated monthly mean of ET0 across India ranged from 10 to 400 mm. ET0 exhibited an increasing trend from January to May, reaching its maximum values in May. In June, ET0 significantly decreased as the monsoon arrived, coinciding with the movement of rainfall patterns. The month of December exhibited the lowest ET0 values. The estimated daily gridded ET0 was compared with station-based ET0, resulting in daily correlation coefficient R2 and daily maximum absolute percentage errors ranging from 0.34 to 0.90 and 10% to 27% respectively. However, these errors decreased to a large extent when considering multiday accumulated values. A comparison was conducted between the GLDAS model ET0 and the station-estimated values, revealing an overestimation of ET0 by the GLDAS model. Additionally, significant variations were observed among the meteorological subdivisions. This highlights the necessity for proper calibration of the GLDAS model ET0 or its effective agricultural application.Similar content being viewed by othersEstimation of evapotranspiration from ground-based meteorological data and global land data assimilation system (GLDAS)Article 23 December 2014Estimation of Satellite-Based Regional-Scale Evapotranspiration for Agriculture Water Management Using Penman–Monteith MethodChapter © 2022Spatio-temporal Variation of Evapotranspiration Derived from Multi-temporal Landsat Datasets using FAO-56 Penman-Monteith MethodChapter © 2021Use our pre-submission checklistAvoid common mistakes on your manuscript.IntroductionAgriculture holds significant importance in driving the socio-economic growth of developing countries such as India, serving as the primary source of livelihood for a substantial portion of the population. As per the 2011 Census, the agricultural and allied sector activities engage 54.6% of the total workforce (Annual Report 2020–21, 2021). Adequate water availability at the right time is crucial for agriculture as it directly influences crop yields. However, the impact of climate change has resulted in irregular precipitation patterns (Soni et al. 2023), leading to adverse effects on agricultural productivity in the country (Abeysekara et al. 2023; Jha et al. 2023; Ondrasek 2014; Zhang et al. 2023; Zizinga et al. 2022). Various meteorological and agriculture departments actively engage in providing agricultural advisories to farmers. Among these advisories, information on when to irrigate and how much to irrigate holds great significance for farmers (Cahn and Johnson 2017; Lorite et al. 2012). It not only helps farmers to save money and enhance crop productivity but also reduces excessive water usage in irrigation.Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a significant role in soil water balance models and various crop water requirement-based models, following precipitation. These models are instrumental in obtaining accurate estimates for irrigation scheduling (Zhang et al. 2011), optimizing irrigation practices, understanding crop water requirements, and predicting yields (Attia et al. 2022; Chen et al. 2023; Lee et al. 2022; Wu et al. 2022). The availability of daily or weekly ET data, along with current soil moisture conditions and weather forecasts, is invaluable in accurately determining crop water requirements and helpful in providing timely irrigation advisories. This integrated approach enhances the effectiveness of water resource management and aids in optimizing agricultural practices (Vuolo et al. 2015).Evapotranspiration (ET) encompasses the combined water loss from the Earth\\'s surface through soil evaporation and plant transpiration (Allen et al. 1998a; Kite 2000). Evapotranspiration (ET) includes various terms, namely potential evapotranspiration (PET), reference evapotranspiration (ET0), and actual evapotranspiration (AET). PET represents the maximum amount of water that could evaporate and be transpired under optimal conditions, assuming an adequate water supply without considering soil moisture constraints. ET0 serves as a benchmark, representing the evaporative demand for a reference crop, such as well-watered grass, considering sufficient water availability. It helps estimate crop water requirements in diverse regions and crops. On the other hand, AET refers to the measured or estimated water loss (evaporation and transpiration) specific to a particular crop. AET can be derived from ET0 by multiplying it with the crop coefficient (kc) (Allen et al. 1998b; Pereira et al. 1999).The estimation of evapotranspiration relies on various techniques that utilizes meteorological and satellite data inputs. Several empirical equations have been developed to estimate evapotranspiration; however, these methods have limitations in terms of data availability and adaptability at the local scale (Hargreaves and Samani 1985; Priestley and Taylor 1972; Thornthwaite 1948; Zhang et al. 2008). Empirical method Penman may require wind calibration (Malek 1994), the radiation method performs well in humid conditions where aerodynamic influence contribution is comparatively small (Tabari et al. 2013; Vishwakarma et al. 2022) and temperature based empirical methods require local calibration (Lee 2010). These empirical methods are suitable to estimate the water demand at low spatial resolution and monthly time scale. Among the available methods FAO-56 Penman Monteith (PM) empirical method estimates evapotranspiration relatively accurately and performs consistently for arid, semi-arid, and humid conditions at a global scale (Abdollahnejad et al. 2018; Allen et al. 1998a; Subedi and Chávez 2015) as it includes both thermodynamics and aerodynamic aspects. FAO 56 Penman Monteith, a globally accepted empirical equation for estimating evapotranspiration, requires multiple inputs such as air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, and relative humidity. However, these inputs are often scarce and rarely available across space, making it challenging to accurately estimate water demand. In developing countries like India, most of the studies have predominantly focused on the point scale due to limited weather station coverage and inconsistent data, which are insufficient for capturing precise spatial variability and translate this information in agriculture advisories. Choudhury 1997 estimated the monthly global PET from the satellite data in which satellite-derived solar radiation, fractional cloud cover, air temperature, and vapour pressure were used. Polar and geostationary satellite derived near surface air temperature and insolation were used to estimate PET estimation in most of the studies (Bois et al. 2008; Cruz-Blanco et al. 2014). Baik and Choi 2015 estimated geostationary satellite-based Priestley-Taylor PET which was compared with high quality, global land surface model GLDAS (25 km) based PET and found significantly overestimated. Rao et al. 2012, estimated station-based PET for 51 stations using 8 different empirical methods and found that the modified Penman Monteith overestimated mostly during summer and Hargreaves method performed better during the northeast monsoon season compared to the other three season. Over the past three decades, numerous researchers have dedicated their efforts to estimating evapotranspiration using various approaches such as satellite data, meteorological data, or a combination of both (Bhattarai et al. 2016; Huerta et al. 2022; Ha et al. 2020; Singer et al. 2021; Vyas et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2016). However, despite these advancements, the full utilization of these methods and datasets is hindered by several challenges. One of the main hurdles is the scarcity of calibration and validation of datasets, which affects the accuracy and reliability of the estimations.Evapotranspiration estimation is significantly influenced by solar radiation, as it is directly proportional to it. Even small uncertainties in solar radiation measurements can introduce considerable errors in evapotranspiration estimation (Heck et al. 2020). However, due to limitations in the availability and consistency of solar radiation data, an alternative solution for estimating evapotranspiration can be found in satellite-derived high spatial and temporal remote-sensed meteorological data. To address the uncertainties in solar radiation, this study developed and discussed a data integration approach that combines remotely sensed insolation products with observed daily meteorological data. This integration enables the estimation of near real-time evapotranspiration at a spatial resolution of 12.5 km and a daily temporal scale for the entire country of India. Although models such as the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) also provide daily evapotranspiration estimates, these models tend to overestimate evapotranspiration and cannot be directly used without proper calibration and validation at the regional scale. This paper focuses on the discussion and validation of the estimated regional evapotranspiration (ET0) specifically in the context of its application in agriculture advisory services. The paper is organized as follows: Section \"Material and methods\", the paper comprehensively addressed the various components of the study. This encompassed discussions about the station observational data covering the 34 meteorological sub-divisions, the INSAT 3D insolation product, the gridded observed temperature product, and the GLDAS-based evapotranspiration. Moreover, the paper also provided insights into the process of deriving the estimated evapotranspiration, outlined the statistical methods utilized for error computation, and described the calibration procedure employed for result comparison. Section \"Results and discussions\"  focused on the patterns of monthly evapotranspiration throughout the region, scrutinizing its 3 days to monthly and sub-divisional variations. The calibration coefficients for both proposed derived ET0 and GLDAS model-based ET0 were presented, alongside statistical comparisons, accuracy assessments, and an exploration of the daily temporal variation at the sub-division level. Finally, in the Summary and Conclusion section, paper discussed the potential use of satellite data in enhancing the quality of agriculture advisories in India and improving various models through the utilization of calibrated proposed evapotranspiration.Material and methodsStudy AreaThis study primarily centers on the Indian subcontinent, encompassing a geographical range of latitude 7.5° to 37.5° N and longitude 67.5° to 97.5° E. The vast size and diverse topography of India contribute to its remarkably varied climate. The agricultural sector and water resources in India greatly rely on the southwest monsoon season. This period holds significant importance as certain regions receive as much as 75% of their annual rainfall during this time, making it a crucial determinant of the country\\'s overall annual precipitation where annual rainfall ranges from 1100 to 2000 mm per year and distribution of rainfall over land mass varies widely. From 1901–2020 the monthly mean of average temperature varies between 18° C to 29° C with annual mean average of 24° C.The climate of India can be categorized into different regions, including tropical, subtropical, and arid/semi-arid regions. The tropical regions are predominantly located in the southern and eastern parts of the country and are characterized by consistently high temperatures throughout the year. Subtropical regions, located in the northern and central parts of India, experience seasonal variations in temperature with hot summers and cold winters. These regions receive rainfall primarily during the monsoon season, although in lesser amounts compared to the tropical regions. Arid or semi-arid regions are primarily situated in the northwest and western parts of India. These regions face low and erratic rainfall throughout the year, resulting in drought conditions and water scarcity (Rajeevan and Nayak 2017; Soni et al. 2023). India is divided into 36 meteorological subdivisions based on the unique rainfall patterns observed across the country (Fig. 1).Fig. 1SRTM DEM and spatial distribution of IMD Agromet stations in meteorological subdivisions of India as follows (1.

Lakshadweep)Full size imageDataObserved station dataIn this study, we selected 34 Agrometeorological observatories (Table 1) to ensure representation from each meteorological subdivision (Fig. 1). This strategic selection facilitated effective validation and calibration of the estimated evapotranspiration (ET0). The Agromet observatories are equipped with sensors to measure various weather variables including maximum and minimum temperature, maximum and minimum relative humidity, rainfall, bright sunshine hours, and evaporation. These stations cover a wide range of conditions, including rainfed and irrigated areas, diverse weather patterns, topography, and soil types. Consequently, the impact of weather and other physical variables was thoroughly investigated. Ground observations from agricultural fields were collected for the years 2017 and 2018.Table 1 Details of IMD Agromet observatories and data usedFull size tableIMD gridded temperature dataTemperature is a critical parameter in the estimation of evapotranspiration, and the use of accurate data is of utmost importance. In this study, we utilized gridded maximum and minimum temperature data obtained from the National Climate Centre (NCC) of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) (https://www.imdpune.gov.in/lrfindex.php, accessed on August 24th, 2021). This dataset is available at a daily frequency with a spatial resolution of 0.5°×0.5° (approximately 2500 km2). It has been found to be highly reliable compared to other datasets available for the Indian region, exhibiting an error of less than 0.5 °C during cross-validation. Moreover, this dataset successfully captures the mean frequency of cold and heat waves, as well as temperature anomalies associated with monsoon breaks (Srivastava et al. 2009).SRTM DEM dataSRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) DEM (Digital Elevation Model) data provides elevation information for nearly the entire Earth’s surface, covering approximately 80% of the globe. It is a joint collaboration between National Aeronautic Space Administration (NASA), National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), and the German Aerospace Center (DLR). It has been widely used in various applications such as geology, hydrology, cartography, and terrain analysis. In this study, we utilized SRTM 90 m (3 Arc second) spatial resolution DEM data (Version 4). This dataset can be accessed through platforms like the United States Geological Survey (USGS), NASA\\'s Earthdata Search, and the CGIAR-CSI SRTM 90 m Database (https://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/ accessed on 28th August 2021). SRTM radar used C and X bands for the preparation of DEM data which has been further processed to fill data voids. (Jarvis et al. 2008).Satellite derived insolation dataINSAT 3D (Indian Geostationary satellite) insolation product, 3DIMG_L2C_INS, provides data with a spatial resolution of 4 km and a temporal resolution of 30 min over the Asia Mercator region. This region spans from 44.5°E to 105.5°E longitude and 10.0°S to 45.5°N latitude. Insolation refers to the total amount of solar radiation flux or irradiance in the shortwave range of 0.3 to 3 µm, which reaches the ground and consists of a combination of direct and diffuse components of solar radiation fluxes. In the retrieval of insolation data from INSAT 3D, two approaches are primarily utilized: statistical or empirical methods (Tarpley 1979) and physical or radiative transfer methods (Tanahashi et al. 2001). These approaches estimate surface insolation by making use of visible and thermal bands. The estimation of instantaneous and daily insolation is achieved through the implementation of a spectrally integrated irradiance model and a three-layer cloudy model, using the INSAT 3D visible (VIS), water vapor (WV), and thermal infrared (IR) bands (Bhattacharya et al. 2013). A trapezoidal integration was applied to construct the daily value from the instantaneous global irradiances in MJm−2. The INSAT 3D insolation product exhibits significantly higher accuracy compared to other available products, such as Heliosat SARAH-E and the NASA MERRA-2 reanalysis product, with improvements of approximately 42.5% and 43.8% respectively (Kamath and Srinivasan 2020).Weather forecast model GFS T1534 reanalysis productsIMD runs weather forecast model GFS T1534 twice daily (00 and 12 UTC) on a horizontal spatial scale of 12.5 km and on a vertical scale of 64 hybrid sigma-pressure layers with a top layer centered around 0.27 hPa (~55 km) to generate 10 days’ deterministic forecast in advance on MIHIR HPCS (Sridevi et al. 2020). The model gives the post-processed output parameters at 25 km and 12.5 km spatial resolution. The atmospheric forecast model used in GFS is a global spectral model (GSM) with spherical harmonic functions. The IMD GFS T1534 operational model’s dynamical core is based on two-time level semi-implicit Lagrangian discretization with three dimensional Hermite interpolation (Sela 2010). The initial conditions are prepared at BHASKARA HPCS, NCMRWF to run the IMD-GFS model using NCEP Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) based hybrid Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) (Buehner et al. 2013). The model is based on the usual expressions of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy at T1534 spectral truncation 12.5 km physics Gaussian grid and 64 levels in a hybrid sigma-pressure vertical grid (Kumar et al. 2019). The detailed structure and physics of the Global Forecast System (GFS) are available at http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/GFS/doc.php.Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS)The GLDAS model integrates satellite and ground-based information using advanced land surface modelling and data assimilation techniques to produce the optimal field of land surface states and fluxes (Rodell et al. 2004). The reanalysed datasets through the common land model (CLM), variable infiltration capacity model (VIC), and Noah LSM are available at GLDAS websites (http://ldas.gsfc.nasa.gov/gldas/) at various spatial scales (0.25° and 1°) and temporal scale (3 h and monthly). In this study, the GLDAS 0.25° (GLDAS_NOAH025_3H 2.1) has been used.MethodologyThe FAO-56 Penman–Monteith empirical method is widely employed for accurately estimating reference evapotranspiration (ET0). However, this method necessitates a significant number of weather inputs, including radiation, relative humidity, air temperature, wind speed, and vapor pressure. Unfortunately, these inputs are often not readily available at a suitable spatial and temporal scale in standard weather observatories. To address this issue of data scarcity from ground stations, we utilized a derived insolation product from the geostationary satellite INSAT-3D to estimate net radiation. Additionally, we incorporated observed India Meteorological Department (IMD) gridded temperature data, IMD GFS model-based reanalysed data for relative humidity and wind speed, and SRTM DEM elevation data. The inclusion of observed and analysed inputs in the model yielded comparatively more accurate results in comparison to utilizing a general model for estimating ET0.FAO-56 Penman–Monteith empirical reference ET 0 frameworkIn 1948, Penman developed an empirical equation to estimate evaporation from an open water surface (Penman 1948). This equation takes into account meteorological parameters such as sunshine, temperature, humidity, and wind speed, utilizing an approach based on energy balance and mass transfer (see Fig. 2 and Table 2). Subsequently, this method was expanded to include cropped surfaces by incorporating factors such as aerodynamic resistance and surface resistance. The FAO proposed a standard parameterization of the Penman–Monteith empirical method (Monteith 1981) for the estimation of daily grass reference evapotranspiration (ET0) from a well-irrigated, homogenous, 0.12 m grass crop height, a fixed surface resistance of 70 s m-1, and an albedo of 0.23 (Allen et al. 1998a). This empirical method, hereafter referred to as PM, is a standard worldwide acceptable method to compute the daily reference ET0 in mm and calculated as follows:$${ET}_{0}=\\\\frac{0.408\\\\Delta \\\\left({R}_{n}-G\\\\right)+\\\\gamma \\\\frac{900}{T+273}{u}_{2}({e}_{s}-{e}_{a})}{\\\\Delta +\\\\gamma (1+0.34{u}_{2})}$$(1)where ET0 is the grass-reference evapotranspiration in mm day−1, Rn is net solar radiance at crop surface in MJ m−2 day−1, G is solar heat flux density in MJ m−2 day−1, T is the air temperature at 2 m height in °C, u2 is the wind speed at 2 m height in m s−1, es is saturation vapour pressure in kPa, ea is actual vapour pressure in kPa, (es—ea) is saturation vapour pressure deficit in kPa, ∆ is slope vapour pressure curve in kPa °C−1, γ is psychrometric constant equivalent to 0.665×10–3 P in kPa °C−1.Fig. 2Flow chart to estimate daily ET0 using FAO-56 Penman Monteith empirical frameworkFull size imageTable 2 Data usedFull size tableSaturation vapour pressure eo(T) kPa at temperature T °C is computed using below empirical equation$${e}^{o}\\\\left(T\\\\right)=0.6108{\\\\text{exp}}\\\\left[\\\\frac{17.27{\\\\text{T}}}{{\\\\text{T}}+237.3}\\\\right]$$(2)Due to the nonlinearity of Eq. 2, the mean saturation vapour pressure for a day should be computed as the mean between the saturation vapour pressure at the mean daily maximum and minimum air temperature for that period.$${e}_{s}=\\\\frac{{e}^{o}({T}_{max})+{e}^{o}({T}_{min})}{2}$$(3)Actual vapour pressure (ea) computed from the relative humidity and saturation vapour pressure using below empirical equation$${e}_{a}=\\\\frac{{e}^{o}\\\\left({T}_{min}\\\\right)*\\\\frac{{RH}_{max}}{100}+{e}^{o}\\\\left({T}_{max}\\\\right)*\\\\frac{{RH}_{min}}{100}}{2}$$(4)The slope vapour pressure curve (∆) [kPa °C-1] at a given ait temperature T°C is computed by$$\\\\Delta =\\\\frac{4098 [0.6108exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{17.27T}{T+237.3}\\\\right)]}{{(T+237.2)}^{2}}$$(5)The psychrometric constant (γ) is computed using P daily mean atmospheric pressure (kPa), λ the latent heat of vaporization (2.45 MJ kg−1), Cp the specific heat at constant pressure (1.013×10–3 MJ kg−1 °C−1), ε ratio molecular weight of water vapor/ dry air (0.622) given by$$\\\\gamma =\\\\frac{{C}_{p}P}{\\\\varepsilon \\\\lambda }=0.000665 P$$(6)where mean atmospheric pressure P (kPa) can be computed from the elevation in meters z by using the below equation$$P=101.3 (\\\\frac{293-0.0065 z}{293}{)}^{5.26}$$(7)Wind speed at 2 m height is required to compute ET0. Generally, in meteorology operations anemometers are placed at 10 m height and in agrometeorology it is placed at the 2 m or 3 m height. To adjust the wind speed data a logarithmic wind speed profile is used for measurement above a short-grassed surface$${u}_{2}={u}_{z} \\\\frac{4.87}{{\\\\text{ln}}(67.8 z-5.42)}$$(8)The soil heat flux (G) is the energy that is used in heating the soil. The positive value of G shows that the soil is warming and negative value of G shows the soil is cooling. In the estimation of ET0, soil heat flux is negligible compared to Rn when the surface is fully covered with vegetation$$G\\\\approx 0$$(9)Net solar radiation (MJ m−2 day−1) is the difference between net shortwave solar radiation and net longwave solar radiation.$${R}_{n}={R}_{net\\\\;shortwave}-{R}_{net\\\\;longwave}$$(10)$${R}_{net\\\\;shortwave}=\\\\left(1-\\\\alpha \\\\right) {R}_{Surface\\\\;insolation}$$(11)where α is the albedo of a hypothetical grass reference crop with a value of 0.23 (Allen et al. 1998a).The earth absorbs the solar radiation and converts it to heat energy. Some of the longwave radiation is absorbed by the atmosphere and some of loses into space. Net longwave solar radiation (Rnl) is computed using the empirical equation$${R}_{nl}=\\\\sigma \\\\left[\\\\frac{{T}_{max, k}^{4}+{T}_{min, k}^{4}}{2}\\\\right]\\\\left(0.34-0.14\\\\sqrt{{e}_{a}}\\\\right)\\\\left(1.35\\\\frac{{R}_{s}}{{R}_{so}}-0.35\\\\right)$$(12)where Rnl is net outgoing longwave radiation (MJ m−2 day−1), σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant (4.903 X 10–9 MJ K−2 m−2 day−1), Tmax, k is the maximum absolute temperature during 24 h period in Kelvin, Tmin, k is minimum absolute temperature during 24 h period in Kelvin, ea is actual vapour pressure (kPa), Rs is solar radiation (MJ m−2 day−1), Rso is clear sky radiation (MJ m−2 day−1), and Rs/Rso is relative shortwave radiation (limited to≤1.0).Clear sky radiation can be computed$${R}_{so}=\\\\left(0.75+2 X {10}^{-5} Z\\\\right) {R}_{a}$$(13)where Z is the station elevation above sea level (m) and Ra is the extraterrestrial radiation (MJ m−2 day−1).The extraterrestrial radiation can be computed$${R}_{a}=\\\\frac{24 \\\\left(60\\\\right)}{\\\\Pi }{G}_{sc}{d}_{r}\\\\left[{\\\\omega }_{s}{\\\\text{sin}}\\\\left(\\\\phi \\\\right){\\\\text{sin}}\\\\left(\\\\delta \\\\right)+{\\\\text{cos}}\\\\left(\\\\phi \\\\right){\\\\text{cos}}\\\\left(\\\\delta \\\\right){\\\\text{sin}}\\\\left({\\\\omega }_{s}\\\\right)\\\\right]$$(14)where Ra is extraterrestrial radiation (MJ m−2 day−1), Gsc is solar constant equal to 0.0820 MJ m−2 min−1, dr is inverse relative distance between Earth and Sun, ωs is sunset hour angle in radian, ϕ is latitude in radian, δ is solar decimation in radian.$${d}_{r}=1+0.033\\\\;cos\\\\;\\\\left(\\\\frac{2\\\\Pi J}{365}\\\\right)$$(15)$$\\\\delta =0.409\\\\;{\\\\text{sin}}\\\\;\\\\left(\\\\frac{2\\\\Pi J}{365}-1.39\\\\right)$$(16)where dr is inverse distance between the earth and the sun, δ is the solar decimation angle, and J is the number of days between 1 to 365 or 366 in Julian date.$${\\\\omega }_{s}=arccos\\\\left(-{\\\\text{tan}}(\\\\phi ){\\\\text{tan}}(\\\\delta )\\\\right)$$(17)where ωs is sunset hour angle and ranges between -1 to 1.Daylight hours are calculated from the sunset angle in radians$$N = \\\\frac{24 {\\\\omega }_{s}}{\\\\pi }$$(18)Solar radiation is derived from the station measured bright sunshine hours (BSSH) and day light hours (N) using an empirical equation.$$Solar\\\\;Radiation=a+\\\\left(\\\\frac{b*BSSH}{N}\\\\right)* {R}_{a}$$(19)where a=0.25 and b=0.5 are constants, Ra is extraterrestrial radiation and N is daylight hours.Statistical analysis used for error estimationA statistical analysis was conducted to compare the estimates from weather stations with the estimated gridded reference evapotranspiration (ET0) data. Evaluation metrics such as mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), and Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) were calculated at both daily and monthly temporal scales.Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)MAPE is a measure of prediction accuracy in the percentage of predicted (P) with respect to observed data (O). It is calculated using the below empirical equation$$MAPE=\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\left|\\\\frac{{O}_{i}-{P}_{i}}{{O}_{i}}\\\\right|}{n} X 100$$(20)Coefficient of determination (R2)The coefficient of determination (R-squared) is basically “goodness of fit” and is the proportion of the fluctuations in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable. R2 values varyvary between 0 to 1, where 1 represents a perfect fit and 0 represents that the model fails.$${R}^{2}= {\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}({O}_{i} - \\\\overline{O })({P}_{i} - \\\\overline{P })}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{({O}_{i} - \\\\overline{O })}^{2}}\\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{({P}_{i} - \\\\overline{P })}^{2}}}\\\\right]}^{2}$$(21)where Oi is daily observed ET0 and Pi is daily estimated gridded ET0.Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE)The Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) is a normalized statistic that determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance (“noise”) compared to the measured data variance (“information”) (Nash and Sutcliffe 1970). The NSE varies between 1 (perfect fit) to -∞. The NSE less than 0 indicates that the mean value of observed time series data would have been a better predicator than the simulated model time series data.$$NSE=1- \\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\\\left({O}_{i} - {P}_{i} \\\\right)}^{2}}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\\\\left({O}_{i} - \\\\overline{O }\\\\right)}^{2}}\\\\right]$$(22)where Oi is daily observed ET0 and Pi is daily estimated gridded ET0.Bias correctionIn this study, we utilized the simple and data-efficient linear bias correction statistical method. To accurately capture weather conditions and ET0, we computed a yearly scale factor (α) based on a time series of station-estimated ET0 and gridded-estimated ET0 data (Eq. 23). To overcome the limitations arising from limited data availability, we considered meteorological subdivisions, which group regions exhibiting similar weather patterns. For each subdivision, we determined a bias scale factor by leveraging ground station data. This approach effectively encompasses the wide spectrum of weather conditions and evapotranspiration patterns found across various subdivisions, despite the constraints posed by limited station data availability.$$Scaling\\\\;factor\\\\;\\\\left(\\\\alpha \\\\right)= \\\\frac{mean\\\\;observed}{mean\\\\;simulated}$$(23)Probability of Detection (POD)The performance diagram (Roebber 2009) is a valuable tool for comparing the probability of detection (POD) and success ratio (SR) between two datasets: estimated gridded ET0 and GLDAS model ET0. It utilizes a contingency table (Table 3) to assess hits, false alarms, misses, and missing rejections when comparing observed values to derived products. This diagram enables a comprehensive evaluation of these metrics, providing insights into the performance and agreement of the datasets. The comparison was conducted between the gridded estimated ET0, GLDAS ET0, and station-estimated ET0 for the period 2017–2018. ET0 values were categorized as low (0–5 mm), medium (5–10 mm), and high (10–15 mm), allowing for a thorough analysis of dataset performance within different ET0 ranges.Table 3 Contingency tableFull size table$$Probability\\\\;of\\\\;Detection\\\\;(POD)= \\\\frac{A}{A+C}$$(24)$$False\\\\;Alarm\\\\;Rate\\\\;(FAR)= \\\\frac{B}{A+B}$$(25)$$Success\\\\;Ratio\\\\;(SR)=1-FAR$$(26)Results and discussionsSpatiotemporal distribution of ET 0 over the Indian regionEvapotranspiration varies throughout the year in response to seasonal changes, as it is influenced by factors such as radiation and temperature.

However, large-scale VGS are costly and require ongoing maintenance, typically carried out manually through trial and error based on professional experience. Advanced management is essential for the sustainability of VGS due to its limited accessibility and associated costs. To address these challenges, we examined the use of remote sensing methods for outdoor VGS monitoring as a basis for a precision agriculture approach for VGS management and maintenance. This study presents the first ongoing monitoring of real-scale VGS using thermal, hyperspectral, and RGB vegetation indices. These indices were employed for the early detection of vegetation stress, focusing on two case studies exhibiting visible yellowing symptoms. Through the application of unsupervised classification techniques, stressed pixels were successfully detected 14–35 days before visual yellowing, achieving an accuracy of 0.85–0.91. Additionally, the thermal index provided valuable information regarding the spatial distribution of watering along the VGS. Stress maps based on noninvasive methods were demonstrated, forming the basis of a spatial decision support system capable of detecting issues related to plant vitality and VGS irrigation management.Keywords: vertical greenery systems (VGS); green wall; monitoring VGS; VGS maintenance; nature-based solution; VGS health1. IntroductionVertical greenery systems (VGS) have gained popularity in recent decades as a nature-based solution and adaptation method for the adverse effects of urbanization and climate change [1]. In addition to their aesthetic benefits, VGS contribute to both indoor and outdoor environments by improving air quality [2,3,4], creating a milder microclimate [5,6], reducing energy consumption [6,7,8], and noise pollution [9,10]. Furthermore, VGS may enhance the psychological well-being of building residents or users [11,12].However, covering buildings with VGS presents significant challenges. The installation, operation, and maintenance of VGS can be complex and costly [13]. Issues such as irrigation problems or plant damage may necessitate specialists’ expertise and the use of cranes, further escalating expenses [14]. Moreover, poorly maintained VGS can lead to dissatisfaction among residents and passersby and can increase fire risk [15], undermining the potential benefits of using VGS as an adaptive solution. Therefore, the continuous monitoring of VGS is crucial, especially since the plants are often difficult to access, and conditions may vary significantly along the VGS [16]. In situ sensors provide valuable continuous monitoring of VGS, but the spatial distribution of the vegetation status cannot be easily achieved [17].The growing demand for efficient VGS monitoring methods to facilitate proper maintenance has arisen as VGS becomes more prevalent in urban areas, along with other green and blue infrastructures [18]. Currently, irrigation in commercial VGS is often determined through trial and error, and VGS health monitoring is primarily based on expert observations conducted periodically [19]. To address the complexities of large-scale VGS maintenance, information technologies (IT), the Internet of Things (IoT), and advanced monitoring technologies may offer valuable assistance [20].Adopting remote sensing and precision agriculture methods for VGS can greatly improve ongoing plant monitoring and aid in the early detection of plant stress. Early detection of changes in plant health is critical for successful agricultural growth [21]. Hyperspectral (HS) and thermal (TIR) imaging are well-established methods in agriculture and natural areas [22,23,24]. The interaction of objects with light at different wavelengths determines their spectral characteristics. For instance, plant pigments exhibit distinct features, such as chlorophyll absorption bands in the blue and red regions. Healthy plants generally have lower reflectance in the visible bands and higher reflectance in the near-infrared (NIR) bands than plants under stress. HS imaging can identify subtle differences in vegetation that may not be visible to the human eye. This technique has been successfully applied to various crops, including estimating biochemical and biophysical properties; evaluating nutrient and stress status; classifying or detecting crop types, weeds, and diseases; and investigating soil characteristics [25,26]. Nevertheless, HS cameras are expensive, and analyzing tens to hundreds of bands in the visible and near-infrared regions can be computationally intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, vegetation indices (VIs) are commonly used to quantitatively and qualitatively highlight specific vegetation features, such as chlorophyll and water content, based on a combination of reflectance at two or more wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum [27]. TIR imaging is often employed to assess temperature differences indicating stress derived from diseases [28] or water deficits in crops [29]. Furthermore, TIR imaging allows targeted interventions and optimization of irrigation strategies [30,31,32].The increasing focus on vertical farming has spurred the advancement of IoT smart sensing technology. This includes a range of sensors implemented to track variables such as room temperature, light intensity, humidity levels, and soil nutrition [33]. Additionally, cable-driven robot prototypes have been developed to monitor and care for vegetation in hard-to-reach areas [14,34]. Some studies have also demonstrated the application of image processing techniques to identify fruits [34], employ Machine Learning Algorithms for detecting tomato diseases [35], and support decisions on whether the plant can be harvested or not using a simple NDVI threshold [36]. Nonetheless, progress in monitoring outdoor VGS remains limited.Gunawardena and Steemers [20], conducted a study on the main maintenance challenges in outdoor VGS based on 12 European case studies. They found that real-time stress detection, and automated response mechanisms were not operational in any of the installations inspected, despite the evident need for such capabilities. While several studies have estimated the water requirement for VGS irrigation management [19,37,38], the utilization of remote sensing in VGS studies is limited. Pérez-Urrestarazu et al. [37] found that using a thermal camera could be valuable in determining substrate moisture to optimize VGS irrigation. Nevertheless, in VGS studies, thermal imaging was primarily performed to assess the wall and foliage skin temperatures [39,40], which could affect the outdoor and indoor microclimate [6].While some studies have explored the use of hyperspectral imaging in green roofs [41,42], its application in VGS is still at a preliminary stage. Yuan et al. [43] monitored the water stress of an indoor green wall using the “triangle method”, which includes surface temperature and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Helman et al. [17] used HS and TIR cameras for spatially continuous monitoring as part of an integrated system that examines the benefits of an indoor green wall. They utilized HS imaging to separate plant species through supervised classification and established correlations between the HS VIs and plants’ CO2 assimilation rate. They also demonstrated a negative correlation between TIR images and stomatal conductance. To the best of our knowledge, except for a few studies that monitored VGS skin temperature, remote sensing tools in VGS studies have been applied only to indoor environments, which are much more homogenous in terms of illumination and climate.Continual monitoring of VGS holds paramount importance for maintenance, encompassing vegetation health and the fine-tuning of irrigation and fertilization systems [20]. Automated monitoring can enhance performance and facilitate decisions in managing VGS. Detecting issues early in vegetated walls can avert irreversible situations necessitating extensive plant replacement. The primary objective of this study is to deploy ground-based remote sensing methods for the assessment of outdoor VGS health. While hyperspectral and thermal cameras offer advanced capabilities, our focus is on demonstrating the practical potential of these methods for monitoring VGS. This approach involves the establishment of a time series comprising RGB, HS, and TIR indices. Furthermore, we used unsupervised classification to detect stressed vegetation in early stages as a basis for a spatial decision support system for real-scale VGS. This study highlights the potential use of remote sensing in enhancing VGS monitoring.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Study AreaThe study was conducted on real-scale VGS as part of the BIU-VGS project at Bar Ilan University (32.067, 34.842) in Mediterranean climate Ramat Gan, the central region of Israel (Figure 1). The study site comprised three identical buildings in the southern campus, which replicated two east–west oriented street canyons. Each building consisted of five floors, with an overall height of 20 m. The canyons had concrete walls facing north and south. During the period from 3 to 18 November 2019, planters were installed on two parallel vertical walls in one of the canyons, covering approximately 450 m2 of vegetated area for each wall. Two VGS technologies were utilized—a green/living wall (GW) on the eastern shafts and a vertical forest (planter boxes attached to the wall) on the remaining walls and the western shafts. The GW was constructed using plastic modules containing a blended soil substrate for planting (40% peat, 40% coconut, and 20% perlite). The case study focused on the GWs located on two vertical concrete walls—one facing north (building 212) and the other facing south (building 213), as shown in Figure 1b. Each GW had dimensions of 11 m in height and 2.7 m in width, covered with plant species Viola hederacea (Figure 1c) and Hedera helix (Figure 1d).Figure 1. The study site.

(e) Weekly water accumulation of the six irrigation pipes at the north-facing (212) and south-facing GWs (213) and weekly mean air temperature (Ta) at the center of the canyon (dotted red line).The irrigation and fertilization of the GW were provided through an automated system based on scheduled programs planned by an irrigation expert. Each GW contained six irrigation lines, with drippers placed every 15 cm along the width of each line. Irrigation was applied at midnight either every one day (during summer) or every two days (during winter). Figure 1e presents the weekly average water accumulation during the study period. The quantities were adjusted based on seasonal variations and, in rare instances, an expert made decisions to decrease or increase water amounts based on direct observations made on-site. The average weekly quantities during May–October were 1.18 m3 (north-facing GW) and 1.56 m3 (south-facing GW), while irrigation significantly decreased during November–December to weekly average quantities of 0.16 m3 (north-facing) and 0.23 m3 (south-facing).2.2. Data AcquisitionThis study was conducted over 8 months between May and December 2020. GWs were monitored every 1–3 weeks using HS and TIR cameras. The cameras were mounted on a 1.5 m height tripod and manually operated from a fixed point on the ground, approximately 15 m away from the GW (Figure 2a,b). All images were collected during midday (11:00 A.M.–2:00 P.M. LT) under clear sky conditions.Figure 2. Data acquisition at the study site. (a) Locations (rectangles) of the HS and TIR shooting of the north (blue) and south (orange) facing GWs. (b) The thermal camera on a tripod toward the north-facing GW at the study site. (c) The timing of the data acquisition in this study, including the yellowing events that were studied for early detection of stress (see Section 2.4) and COVID quarantines that affected mainly the collection of TIR data.The HS images were obtained using a Specim IQ® camera (Specim–Spectral Imaging, Oulu, Finland) with a spectral resolution of 7 nm and 204 bands across the wavelength range of 397–1003 nm. Each image from the Specim IQ® camera was a square of 512 × 512 pixels with a field of view (FOV) of 31°, providing a spatial resolution of 3 cm/pixel at the GW. All images were normalized using a 99% barium sulfate white reference (provided with the camera). Due to the vertical alignment, large scale, and limited accessibility of the VGS, the camera operated in “custom” mode, where the white reference was recorded and saved to the camera before the actual VGS recordings. The white reference was placed at the lower area of each GW and recorded every 15 min.A FLIR A655sc (FLIR Systems, Wilsonville, OR, USA) camera was used for collecting TIR images. This camera is an uncooled microbolometer with 640 × 480 pixels, sensitive to radiation in the range of 7.5–14.0 µm. It is equipped with a lens with a FOV of 45° and provides a spatial resolution of 4 cm/pixel at the GW. The camera has a noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD, i.e., thermal sensitivity) of less than 30 mK and a thermal accuracy of ±2 °C or ±2% of the reading. The temperature values acquired by the camera were adjusted using FLIR Research IR software (version 4.40.9.30) by setting the air temperature (Ta), relative humidity (RH), and target distance. An emissivity of 0.95 was used to correct all thermal images. Due to technical issues with the thermal camera during COVID-19 quarantine restrictions, intermittent gaps occurred in the TIR time series data. Ta and RH were measured at 30 min intervals using HMP 155 Vaisala sensors with an accuracy of ±0.2 °C for Ta and ±1% for RH. These measurements were stored in cloud-based storage. Sensors were placed in three locations: 10 m from the GWs in the middle of the street canyon and 1 m near each GW (see red circles in Figure 1b). The timing of the data collection during this study is presented in Figure 2c.2.3. Image ProcessingFigure 3 illustrates the image processing stages. The pre-processing of HS and TIR images involved their projection to each other using ArcGIS Pro software (version 3.0) and the extraction of Regions of Interest (ROIs) of approximately 13.5 m2 using the raster clip tool. The two plant species in the GW were separated (classified) due to their different phenological cycles, canopy closure characteristics, and vegetative properties. We employed the spectral angle mapper (SAM) supervised classification in ENVI software (version 5.6.1) to create a species mask for each GW (Figure 4). An image with a full green cover and without visible stress symptoms was selected for this purpose (north-facing: 14 September; south-facing: 24 August). Later, this mask was utilized to separate species in the HS and TIR time series analysis. After these pre-processing stages, the image processing flow was carried out using Python. The HS images were normalized (as described in Section 2.3.1), and all images (HS and TIR) were resized based on the smallest pixel found in each orientation time series.Figure 3. Illustration of image processing stages.Figure 4. Masks based on SAM classification for plant separation (ROI in red; mask contour in magenta) were used in the HS (NDVI, left) and TIR (∆𝑇, right) time series analysis (see Section 2.3.1 and Section 2.3.2). (a) North-facing GW (14 September) and (b) south-facing GW (24 August).2.3.1. Hyperspectral (HS) Image ProcessingIn the HS images, the white reference was positioned at the lower part of the GW. To eliminate illumination differences along the GW, a pixel-based spectrum normalization (sometimes referred to as Norm-1) was performed as follows:𝑅̂𝑝𝑖=𝑅𝑝𝑖/∑204𝑗=1𝑅𝑝𝑗(1)where p is the pixel, and i and j are the bands. In the normalization process, each spectral band of a pixel is divided by the sum of all the pixel’s spectral bands, ensuring that the sum of all bands for a given pixel is equal to 1. This allows for relative comparisons and analysis of spectral information for the entire image, considering the proportion of each spectral band within a pixel.For each species, 12 vegetation indices (VIs) were calculated, as shown in Table 1. The VIs were organized into categories based on their sensitivity (pigment; leaf structure; water content) and their band’s range (VIS-RGB; VIS-HS; NIR + VIS; NIR). For further analysis, two separate branches were pursued. (a) In the first branch, a kernel technique was employed. For each VI image, the standard deviation (“STD kernel”) was computed within 10 × 10 pixels moving window. This process involved iterating over the entire image, extracting data from each window, and generating a time series of the average STD kernel values for all VIs separated into species. These time series were used for the ongoing monitoring of the GWs. (b) In the second branch, a time series of VIs was built. For noise reduction in each VI image, Gaussian Blurring (size of 5 × 5 pixels) was applied. This is a smoothing method that removes noise generated by Gaussian distribution [44]. These time series presented the average value for each VI, separated into species, and were used for the ongoing monitoring of the GWs and later to examine the potential of early detection of vegetation stress in VGS (see Section 2.4).Table 1. Vegetation indices separated into categories according to the VIs sensitivity.2.3.2. Thermal (TIR) Images ProcessingWater stress is known to be correlated with stomatal closure, resulting in reduced transpiration and elevated leaf temperatures above the ambient temperature [58,59]. The canopy-to-air temperature difference (∆T) is widely used as an indicator of plant health, heat stress tolerance, or drought stress in crops [60], and is calculated based on the TIR images as follows:∆T = Tcanopy − Ta(2)where Tcanopy is the temperature of vegetation at each pixel and Ta is the air temperature measured in situ, 1 m from each GW. Generally, if a plant has sufficient water, ∆T ≤ 0, whereas under water stress, ∆T > 0. Gaussian Blurring (5 × 5 pixels) was applied to the ∆T images to reduce noise, similar to what was done for the VIs images. The time series of ∆T were separated into species and used for the ongoing monitoring of the GWs and later for early detection of vegetation stress in VGS using TIR images.2.4. Stress Detection2.4.1. Yellowing Index and Ground TruthIn mid-October 2020 (south-facing GW—213) and mid-November 2020 (north-facing GW—212), the Viola hederacea plants along the GWs began to turn yellow and eventually died (Figure 5). In contrast, the Hedera helix plants, which are known as less sensitive plants, remained green and survived throughout the study and beyond. This period coincided with COVID-19 quarantine restrictions in Israel, and irrigation and fertilizer were not properly managed, likely contributing to vegetation degradation. The yellowing events caused significant damage to the GW, dissatisfaction among residents and passersby, and required extensive vegetation replacement using cranes. The time series of the Viola hederacea plants’ yellowing in both GWs are referred to as “yellowing events” in the study.Figure 5. Study area and yellowing events in the north (blue) and south-facing (orange) GWs.To investigate the usage of HS and TIR imaging for the early detection of stress events in the GWs, the yellowing areas in the time series were detected and delineated. A “yellowing index” for Viola hederacea was manually created to quantify the percentage of yellowing at each time step. This process involved visual observation of RGB and HS images, histogram investigation of yellow and green pixels, and examination of several RGB chlorophyll detection indices from the Sánchez-Sastre et al. [61] study (see Table A1 in Appendix A). The RGB r index (Table 1) was chosen to represent stressed vegetation. By setting a fixed threshold (based on histogram properties and visual inspection) of 0.3, the r index, hereafter referred to as the “yellowing index”, successfully captured yellow (r index value > 0.3) and green (r index value < 0.3) pixels. The yellowing index was analyzed for 10 time steps (from 24 September to 21 December at the north-facing GW and from 4 September to 1 December at the south-facing GW). One image per GW, close to the end of the yellowing event at each GW (14 December at the north-facing GW and 24 November at the south-facing GW), was selected as the reference image (ground truth) for stressed (yellow) pixels.2.4.2. Stress Detection in VIs and Thermal Index ImagesTo investigate the feasibility of detecting stress events before the visual stage (yellowing) in VGS, we classified the HS VIs and ∆T thermal index images into stressed and green pixels. For each VI (Table 1) and thermal index image in the 10 yellowing index time steps, we used an unsupervised Otsu threshold [62] and Multi-Otsu [63] to divide each image into two or three groups based on the presence of yellow pixels. When minimal or no yellow pixels were detected in the image (yellowing index < 0.5%), the data was split into two groups. Conversely, when yellow pixels were already present in the image (the yellow index was greater than 0.5%), the data was divided into three groups to increase sensitivity and allow for early detection of pre-yellowed stressed pixels. Separating into two groups only allowed the differentiation of yellow pixels from other pixels but could not detect the variance (stressed, non-stressed) in the rest of the image. For each time step, we classified the pixels as green, stressed, and yellow (if present).2.4.3. Stress Detection Performance EstimationTo evaluate the performance of the classifiers for early stress detection, we compared the classified (predicted: under stress or green) pixels from each HS VIs and ∆T index time step to the reference image (ground truth: yellow or green) and created a confusion matrix. The matrix was divided into four classes (Figure 6):True positive (TP): yellow pixels that were correctly predicted as under stress.False positive (FP): green pixels that were falsely predicted as under stress.True negative (TN): green pixels that were correctly predicted as green.False negative (FN): yellow pixels that were falsely predicted as green.Figure 6. Illustrations of the confusion matrix structure as used in this study. (a) Process of the calculated area. (b) Confusion matrix for yellow (under stress) and green (healthy) pixels as recognized by the ground truth (actual) and the VIs and thermal indices (predicted).The metrics that were used to describe the classifiers’ success for early stress detection based on the confusion matrix were: accuracy, precision, false positive rate (false alarm), and F1 score. Recall was also calculated for the F1 score calculation. The metrics were calculated as follows:Accuracy = (TP + TN)/(TP + FP + TN + FN)(3)Precision = TP/(TP + FP)(4)False positive rate (false alarm) = FP/(FP + TN)(5)Recall = TP/(TP + FN)(6)The F1 score, a single-value metric, combines precision and recall using the harmonic mean. It considers both false negatives and false positives, making it a useful metric for imbalanced data [64]. In this study, the F1 score was utilized to assess the classifier’s performance and ensure that the classification results were not merely due to random chance.3. Results3.1. Ongoing Monitoring of VGS Using HS and TIR ImagesThe average value of VIs allowed us to assess the general status of vegetation in VGS using remote and non-destructive methods. Figure 7 shows the time series of average VIs values and STD kernel from May to December 2020 for the two species in each GW. In both GWs, the VIs initially showed stable or minor changes in average values for several months. However, as the yellow visual symptoms appeared on the plants, there were noticeable changes in vegetation dynamics, with some VIs showing a rise while others demonstrated a drop, as well as a rise in standard deviation and STD kernel, all synchronized with the yellowing event.Figure 7. Average VIs and standard deviation (shading) time series of Viola hederacea (purple) and Hedera helix (green). The green (Hedera helix) and purple (Viola hederacea) dotted lines represent the STD kernel with values in the secondary y-axis. (a) North-facing and (b) south-facing GWs. The vertical yellow shading and red triangles indicate the yellowing events on 18 November in (a) and October 14 in (b). The dates (November–December) in (b) where the images were in shadow conditions are marked in black lines. The data in (b) of the Hedera helix on 1 November was dropped due to mixed shadowed and sunny conditions. See details of VIs in Table 1.For the north-facing GW (Figure 7a), the average NDVI and standard deviation were 0.84 and 0.017 (Viola hederacea), and 0.79 and 0.019 (Hedera helix), respectively, from the beginning of the monitoring until the yellowing event. Just before the yellowing event (14 October to 1 November), the averages increased even further, and the standard deviation decreased (0.87, 0.009 for Viola hederacea; 0.83, 0.012 for Hedera helix). At the onset of the yellowing event (18 to 24 November), the averages decreased to 0.84 (−3.4% for Viola hederacea) and 0.81 (−2.4% for Hedera helix), and the standard deviation increased to 0.049 (540% for Viola hederacea) and 0.044 (360% for Hedera helix) compared to the period just before the yellowing event. As the yellowing event progressed (1 to 21 December), the averages further decreased to 0.651 (−22% for Viola hederacea) and 0.759 (−6% for Hedera helix), and the standard deviation increased to 0.154 (314% for Viola hederacea) and 0.077 (175% for Hedera helix), compared to the beginning of the yellowing event. Similarly, the REIP and OSAVI averages decreased, and the standard deviation increased at the beginning of the yellowing event and beyond. The water content indices, WBI and NW-2, exhibited periodic changes throughout the study, with more drastic average decreases and standard deviation increases (WBI: −5.7%, 270%; NW-2: −15.7%, 300%) in Viola hederacea at the beginning of the yellowing. Other VIs were either not stable (e.g., r, G, PRI, NPQI, RVI, and mSR705) or very stable (e.g., SIPI) throughout the seasons, but also showed a decrease in average value and a drastic increase in standard deviation at the beginning of the yellowing event. Both species experienced decreases in average VIs and increases in standard deviation, indicating degradation of the entire GW during the yellowing event. Nevertheless, the changes in average and standard deviation values were more significant for Viola hederacea, and it eventually turned yellow and died. As for the STD kernel, the increase for both species began even before the beginning of the yellowing event (around 21 October) and continued to rise until the end of the time series. Some indices (e.g., NDVI, G, and PRI) exhibited a more synchronized response with the vegetation condition than others (e.g., NPQI, NWI-2, and mSR705).At the south-facing GW (Figure 7b), the NDVI averages and standard deviation were 0.77 and 0.013 (Viola hederacea), and 0.81 and 0.017 (Hedera helix) respectively from the beginning of the monitoring until the yellowing event, and 0.765 and 0.031 (Viola hederacea), and 0.788 and 0.032 (Hedera helix) just before the yellowing event (14 to 30 September). At the onset of the yellowing event (14 October), the average of both species dropped, and the standard deviation drastically increased by −12%, 387% (Viola hederacea), and −3.8%, 125% (Hedera helix) compared to the period just before the yellowing event. In this GW, the Viola hederacea yellowing event was much more intensive and was visually apparent from the beginning. Thus, the difference between the species is even more significant than in the north-facing GW. As the yellowing event progressed (21 October to 1 December), the averages continued to decrease to 0.578 (−14% for Viola hederacea) and 0.738 (−2.6% for Hedera helix). Several VIs (i.e., PRI, RVI, and mSR705) gradually decreased in both species throughout the monitoring period, which may indicate a gradual degradation in the entire GW vitality over the year. However, during the yellowing event, all VIs values sharply changed in average and standard deviation only for the Viola hederacea, which turned yellow, while Hedera helix changes were much more moderate. As for the STD kernel, the increase was more intense for Viola hederacea and started only at the beginning of the yellowing event (14 October) and continued to rise until the end of the time series. Like the north-facing GW, the STD kernels of the indices showed variable synchronization with the vegetation condition. However, unlike the north-facing GW, the STD kernel did not increase before the yellowing event.During the study period, the north-facing GW remained entirely shaded, while the south-facing GW was fully exposed to sunlight during midday. Due to seasonal changes in the sun’s position, the south-facing GW (213) was entirely shaded in the last two images (24 November and 1 December), and partially shaded at the bottom of the GW (mainly at the Hedera helix areas) in the third image from the end (1 November). The shading conditions affected several pigment VIs in the last (2–3) images in the time series (Figure 7b). For example, PRI and NPQI sharply decreased during the yellowing event but started to increase on 1 November, even though the yellowing event continued. Due to the mixed sun-shadow conditions in the 1 November image, noisy values were observed in PRI, NPQI, WBI, and NW-2 in the Hedera helix dataset. Therefore, we excluded this time step from the time series. The complete time series data, including the excluded time step, can be found in Figure A1 in Appendix A.Figure 8 presents the average ∆T of the two species for each GW. Data from the thermal camera is missing from 24 September until 21 October and on 23 June (north-facing GW) due to a technical problem (see Section 2.2). From the ∆T time series, it is evident that the north-facing GW (212) did not exhibit drastic changes in ∆T, except toward the end of the time series when ∆T began to rise as the GW yellowing progressed. This rise was observed in both species, although Hedera helix did not undergo yellowing. Conversely, at the south-facing GW, the ∆T index exhibited a consistent rise and was even slightly higher for the Hedera helix. Following the commencement of the yellowing event, ∆T in Viola hederacea continued to increase and surpassed that of Hedera helix. Data was unavailable before and after the commencement of the yellowing event, introducing uncertainty for this period. The consistent rise in ∆T was also observed', 'unique_identifier': 238}\n",

Remote sensing technology offers a promising alternative to traditional in situ measurements for estimating stem water potential (Ψstem). In this study, we carried out field measurements of Ψstem in an irrigated olive orchard in southern Italy during the 2021 and 2022 seasons. Water status data were acquired at midday from 24 olive trees between June and October in both years. Reflectance data collected at the time of Ψstem measurements were utilized to calculate vegetation indices (VIs). Employing machine learning techniques, various prediction models were developed by considering VIs and spectral bands as predictors. Before the analyses, both datasets were randomly split into training and testing datasets. Our findings reveal that the random forest model outperformed other models, providing a more accurate prediction of olive water status (R2 = 0.78). This is the first study in the literature integrating remote sensing and machine learning techniques for the prediction of olive water status in order to improve olive orchard irrigation management, offering a practical solution for estimating Ψstem avoiding time-consuming and resource-intensive fieldwork.Keywords: vegetation indices; spectral bands; satellite; irrigation management; olive; modeling1. IntroductionThe Mediterranean basin is famous for its rich history of olive tree cultivation since the Roman and Greek civilizations [1], both for table olives and olive oil production, which represent essential components of the Mediterranean diet [2]. The climate condition in these areas is generally characterized by hot summers and mild winters, which are well-suited for olive tree growth [3]. According to the International Olive Oil Council [4], Mediterranean countries accounted for approximately 97% of the world’s olive cultivation, with countries such as Spain, Italy, Portugal, Greece, and France being the leaders in global olive production, representing 81% of the total olive production [2]. In addition to their economic value, olive agroecosystems have a long-lasting history and represent an invaluable local heritage for landscape, trade, and social traditions [5], sometimes cultivated as a part of agroforestry systems [6]. Most of the olive-growing areas of the Mediterranean region are located in a semi-arid environment with high annual ETo and low annual rainfall. The general trends for fresh water supply limitations in Mediterranean countries make it essential to understand the olive tree water relations [7], as well as to develop measurement methods for olive tree water status and stress detection in large areas [8]. It is widely accepted that water deficiencies can lead to significant yield loss, whereas adequate management of irrigation water can optimize crop production as well as the fruit quality (technological, nutraceutical, and health) of the extra virgin olive oil obtained [9]. Moreover, reducing water supplies in the most drought-tolerant phenological phases does not decrease fruit yield, accelerate fruit maturity, and improve the polyphenols content of the olive oil [10].It has always been believed that plant water requirements differ among species and even cultivars, making irrigation scheduling and management a complex task for growers [11]. Therefore, site- or crop-specific water status monitoring is becoming crucial to optimize irrigation scheduling [12]. Traditionally, in situ measurements of plant water status are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and destructive, allowing only limited samples and repetitions. Therefore, reliable measurements of plant water stress over large areas are often required for water management applications in agriculture. Remote sensing has increasingly been utilized to detect plant water stress, with interesting advantages, e.g., cost-effectiveness and versatility, leading to a useful spatial display of the water stress patterns necessary to manage orchard irrigation [13]. Various vegetation indices have been related to leaf and canopy water content [13]. Leaf water potential (Ψleaf) measurements can detect the onset of water deficiency, allowing a reaction before permanent damage occurs [14]. However, it can result in high variability within one tree. Recent studies regarding irrigation water scheduling and management have focused on the stem water potential (Ψstem) as an important parameter of the water status of non-transpiring leaves, which is related to water availability and transpiration. To solve the problem of water status variability within one tree, most researchers focused on the measurement of Ψstem as an indicator of plant water status in several fruit orchards [14,15,16], including olive trees, for which Ψstem measurement is crucial for irrigation planning and scheduling [17,18]. Nevertheless, there is little information in the literature regarding irrigation strategies using Ψstem in olive trees [19] due to the lack of reliable methodology for continuous and economically viable monitoring of Ψstem in different olive orchard environments. Although numerous works are showing the usefulness of monitoring some physiological parameters such as Ψstem [20] and stomatal conductance [21] in an open field (using proximal sensors) for the correct water irrigation management and to optimize water use efficiency in olive cultivation, the potential of remote monitoring of Ψstem, using different remote sensing (RS) platforms, has not yet been fully explored nor widely adopted [22], especially in olive orchards. Recent studies by Caruso et al. [18,22] for the estimation of some physiological parameters based on images acquired by UAVs showed the benefits of RS technology in terms of simplifying the data acquisition, which is useful for irrigation management. Nevertheless, the use of UAVs is still expensive and needs extensive fieldwork to operate them. A previous study by Suárez et al. [23] used a series of diurnal airborne campaigns by Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) over two years in an olive orchard field to investigate changes in the canopy photochemical reflectance index (PRI), the combined TCARI/OSAVI, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), as an indicator of water stress, as a function of field-measured physiological indicators of water stress such as stomatal conductance, stem water potential, steady-state fluorescence, and the canopy crown’s temperature. Among the three VIs calculated, the authors found that only the airborne PRI demonstrated sensitivity to diurnal changes in physiological indicators of water stress, including Ψstem measured in the field at the time of each image acquisition. However, the use of airplanes is still time-consuming and can add significant costs to farmers due to their operational costs. Therefore, using satellite images to estimate plant water status parameters would be a viable option as a rapid data acquisition source. In this study, remote sensing data were acquired from commercial smallsats, specifically Planet’s PlanetScope sensors [24], and processed in QGIS [25] to obtain the reflectance value of each spectral band and to calculate vegetation indices. The reflectance value of each band and the vegetation indices were used to test different machine-learning models to predict stem water potential for olive trees. The main objective of this study was to develop, through the integration of remote sensing and machine learning techniques, a predictive model of olive orchards’ water status to support farmers in managing irrigation water, reducing expensive, difficult, and time-consuming fieldwork in the frame of sustainable water irrigation management.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Study Site and Climatic ConditionsThis study was conducted in a commercial olive orchard situated near Gallipoli (Apulia Region, Southern Italy) (latitude: 40°01′23.3″ N; longitude: 18°03′06.4″ E; 23 m above sea level) over two years (2021 and 2022). Olive trees at the study site were planted with Olea europaea L. cv. Leccino at a spacing of 7 m × 7 m between rows and between trees, covering a study area of about 0.80 ha (Figure 1). The studied olive orchard was fertilized using commercial fertilizer with N 70 kg/ha—P2O5 40 kg/ha—K2O 60 kg/ha according to the regional guidelines [26] for sustainable crop management given by the local government of the Apulia Region.Figure 1. Location of the olive orchard experimental field. Red points indicate Ψstem measurements on the selected olive tree during the two study years (2021 and 2022) (Google Earth image ©).The climate condition at the studied olive orchard is Mediterranean, belonging to a temperate-dry-hot summer climate-Csa class according to Köppen and Geiger, with hot and dry summers and mildly cold winters [27]. Generally, the hottest month at the study site is August (the average temperature is around 26.4 °C), and the average annual rainfall is about 678 mm. Climate data during the two years were provided by the Apulia Region meteorological stations [28]. The analysis of climate data indicates that the amount of rainfall in both years was reported to be 415.4 mm and 579 mm during 2021 and 2022, respectively. However, the rainfall amount in both years was less than the annual average amount typical of the area (678 mm). In the 2021 season, the highest average temperature was reported in August (32.6 °C), whereas the lowest average temperature was reported in January (8.2 °C), and the rainiest month was November (123.2 mm). In the 2022 season, the highest average temperature was reported in August (32.9 °C), and the lowest average temperature was reported in January (7.2 °C), with the rainiest month reported to be in December (120.9 mm). The highest values of actual evapotranspiration (ETo) were recorded in June and July in both years (Figure 2; Tables S1 and S2).Figure 2. The monthly amount of rainfall, irrigation water applied, and trend of ETo were calculated following the Hargreaves–Samani equation [29] (a). The monthly trend of average minimum and maximum temperatures in the study area during the two years of the experiment (b).2.2. Irrigation Management and Plant Water Status DeterminationIn both seasons (2021 and 2022), irrigation water in the experimental olive orchard was managed using a decision support system (DSS). Irrigation scheduling was organized to keep the soil water content (SWC) of the first 30 cm (active root zone) of the soil at an optimum level (set as a recharge point (RP) where water can be easily taken up by the plant). This was possible by identifying the field capacity and the welting point according to the specific physical soil characteristics of the study site. Each year, irrigation interventions were applied in full irrigation (FI) regimes scheduling, considering the differences in water needs as the crop grows, according to the phenological stages. The soil moisture was kept at 34% Ɵ, while RP was set to 26%. Soil moisture was monitored using sensors (TEROS 12 Advanced; Meter Group, 2365 NE Hopkins Ct., Pullman, WA, USA) and a control unit (ZL6 Advanced Cloud data logger; Meter Group, 2365 NE Hopkins Ct., Pullman, WA, USA). The amount of irrigation water applied in 2021 was 799 m3; in 2022, it was 1311 m3 (Table S3). The olive orchard was irrigated more in 2022 than in 2021, considering the fruit load (in 2021, there was no production, whereas in 2022, production was about 800 kg/ha). Figure 2 reports the monthly amount of irrigation water applied and rainfall and the trend of ETo in both years. The salinity of the water used for irrigation was adequate (2.11 ± 0.30 dS/m), not exceeding the threshold value of 4.2 ds/m, as reported in Pedrero et al. [30]. Plant water status was measured in both years on 24 sample olive trees by detecting the stem water potential (Ψstem; MPa) using a pressure chamber (Plant Water Status Console 3000F01, SOILMOISTURE CORP., Santa Barbara, CA, USA). However, before the measurement of Ψstem, mature and fully expanded leaves were placed in aluminum foil for 60 min. Hence, every shoot was placed in the pressure chamber, and gaseous nitrogen was insufflated until the equilibrium was reached; then, the water potential value was read on the console. In each year, Ψstem was measured 4 times during the irrigation season (from June to October; in both years, all Ψstem measurements were conducted at midday (11.00 to 13.00 h solar time)).2.3. Satellite Data, Image Processing, and Vegetation IndicesIn this study, we used PlanetScope (PS) high-resolution satellite images (Imagery© 2021 and 2022, Planet Labs PBC, San Francisco, CA, USA [24]). The PS constellation, consisting of more than 130 satellites, currently includes three generations of satellites, including SuperDoves (PSB.SD). PSB.SD is the third generation of PlanetScope sensors, which acquire daily imagery utilizing 8 spectral bands (i.e., Coastal Blue, 431–452 nm, Blue, 465–515 nm, Green I, 513–549 nm, Green, 547–583 nm, Yellow, 600–620 nm, Red, 650–680 nm, Red Edge, 697–713 nm and NIR, 845–885 nm) with a spatial resolution of 3 m and the equator crossing time of 7.30–11.30 a.m. (local solar time) [24,31]. In this study, 8 PlanetScope images were downloaded from the online tool “Planet Explorer” as orthorectified and radiometrically corrected TIFFs [24] on the same days as Ψstem field measurement. We used a spectral image acquired from a UAV at the beginning of the 2019 irrigation season to identify the trees under consideration within the field. For each tree considered, we calculated the average reflectance of the pixels—within the same spectral band—in the correspondence of the tree canopy by using the QGIS tool “Zonal statistics” (QGIS Białowieża, 3.22.5 for Windows). Additionally, several vegetation indices (VIs) were calculated: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), transformed chlorophyll absorption reflectance index (TCARI), combined TCARI/OSAVI, enhanced vegetation index (EVI), modified chlorophyll absorption reflectance index (MCARI), combined MCARI/OSAVI, simple ratio (SR), transformed vegetation index (TVI), and normalized difference red edge (NDRE). The full range of the VIs calculated in this study can be seen in Table 1, along with their description and application references in olive orchards.Table 1. Formulation and source of the vegetation indices (VIs) used in this study.2.4. Statistical Analysis and Machine LearningIn this study, the performances of two machine learning techniques (support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF)) and linear regression (multiple linear regression (MLR)) were tested to create Ψstem predictive models and test their robustness. The first approach used was the SVM [40,41]. To test the performance of the SVM, a radial basis kernel was used by applying a tune grid-search with the function tune() (“e1071” package) to test different combinations of cost and gamma. The best combination found for our datasets was cost = 1.5; gamma = 1 and cost = 1.5; gamma = 0.5 for PBs and VIs, respectively. The second approach used was the MLR. In this approach, we avoided using all the variables to predict Ψstem, maintaining only the statistically significant (p < 0.05) variables. The third modeling was the RF [42], an ensemble learning technique. In this study, the RF models were implemented using the “ranger” package. Moreover, to optimize the performance of the models, we utilized the “caret” package. In the ranger implementation of RF, we fine-tuned several parameters, including the number of trees, the number of variables to potentially split each node (mtry), the splitting rule, and the minimum node size. Model calibration was run multiple times using various combinations of these parameters, except for the number of trees, which was fixed at 500, as it did not significantly impact the overall performance of the models. To evaluate the importance of each variable, we used a permutation method [43], where the increase in model prediction error was calculated for each run with one variable excluded from the predictors set. The resulting values were then scaled from 0 to 100. Pearson’s r of the correlation, coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), normalized root mean square error (nRMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) were used as measures of the performance to compare the models. The statistical analysis and modeling were performed using Rstudio (Rstudio, PBC, Boston, MA, USA) for Windows, Version 2022.12.0 + 353. For the graphical representation of information and data, SigmaPlot (SigmaPlot, Systat Software Inc., Version 14 for Windows) was used.Data HandlingThe analyses were conducted using two distinct approaches to data handling. In the first approach, data collected during the two years of the experiment were combined in a unique dataset (n = 192) and then randomly divided into a calibration (80%) and a testing (20%) dataset. The training dataset was used to fit the model, while the testing dataset was used to test the goodness of fit of the predictive model. In the second approach, models were trained on the first-year dataset (n = 96), and the performance of the models was tested on the second-year dataset (n = 96).In both approaches, to predict Ψstem as a function of the variables derived from the satellite (PSB.SD), two groups of predictors were tested:(1)A dataset containing the PBs reflectance value for each sample tree.(2)A dataset containing the VIs value calculated for each sample tree.3. Results3.1. Stem Water Potential of Olive TreesDuring the experiment, Ψstem varied over a wide range (−0.8 to about −3.5 MPa). Figure 3 shows a boxplot of Ψstem during the different phenological stages of the olive trees and in both years. The data indicates a significant variation of Ψstem between the different periods of the olive trees’ development stages in both years. Figure 3 shows higher Ψstem variations over the summer period (July and August) in both years. The analysis of olives’ water status results indicates that Ψstem was decreased during the fruit development (50%) phase (2021 DOY: 210; 2022 DOY: 206) and then increased during the successive phenological stages (beginning of fruit color and harvest maturity) in both years (Figure 3). Despite the variation of Ψstem across years and between crop development stages, the overall results showed that Ψstem did not fall below −4 MPa.Figure 3. Box plot showing the variation of field measured Ψstem at different development stages of olive trees during both growing seasons (2021 and 2022). Green circles indicate the mean values.3.2. Multispectral Planet Band Reflectance Value and Vegetation IndicesIn this study, the ratio of the reflectance in different spectral bands was used to calculate 10 VIs (Table 1) according to the spectral characteristics of the PlanetScope sensors. Table 2 reported the mean and standard error of the considered predictors (PBs and VIs) in this study during the different phenological stages. The calculated VIs reported different values during the different olive phenological stages. In general, the maximum value was reported for TVI, whereas the minimum was reported for MCARI in both years. Some VIs values did not have a regular trend and changed (with higher or lower values) according to the phenological phase and/or the study year. The NDVI values, for example, show the same trend as the Ψstem, where the values dropped during the summer period (particularly in July and August) in both study years. Among the calculated VIs, the TVI index gave the highest value, whereas the lowest value was reported for MCARI at the different olive phenological stages and during both seasons.Table 2. Mean and standard error of the predictors considered in this study (vegetation indices (VIs) and Planet Bands’ reflectance (PBs)) during the different phenological stages (mean of 24 sample olive trees) for the two years of the study (2021 and 2022).3.3. Evaluation of Ψstem Prediction Performance3.3.1. Dataset Combination ApproachThe following subsections report the results of the models’ training conducted after combining the datasets from the two years of the experiment.Random ForestThe results obtained from the RF-based model were similar to the results obtained using the other modeling approaches when considering VIs as Ψstem predictors (Testing R2 = 0.57; Testing nRMSE = 18.80%) (Table 3; Figure S2). However, when PBs were used as model predictors, the results significantly improved (Testing R2 = 0.78; Testing nRMSE = 13.20%).Table 3. Performance of the robustness of the models trained with datasets combination.The optimization of RF model parameters (min node size, mtry, and splitting rule) with PBs as predictors are reported in Figure 4. The importance of the variables is reported in Figure 5. A high percentage of importance indicates that the explanatory variables are an important predictor for the Ψstem of the olive trees. In this study, the results indicate that B5 (600–620 nm) had the highest value of importance in the model (100%), followed by B4 (547–583 nm), with the second-best value of importance. In contrast, the other PBs had an importance value lower than 40%. The B2 (465–515 nm in the blue region) had no weight of importance in the model.Figure 4. Optimization of RF-based model parameters (min node size; mtry; splitting rule) using PBs as Ψstem predictors.Figure 5. Results of permutation procedure to assess the importance of the variables of the RF-based model using PBs (B1–B8) as predictors of olive Ψstem.According to the values of the model performance parameters (R2, RMSE, nRMSE, MAE), it is evident that the RF-based model gives more accurate Ψstem prediction results compared to the MLR and SVM models at both calibration and testing levels (Table 3). In addition, Pearson’s correlation (Figure 6) showed a significant correlation between measured Ψstem and predicted Ψstem of the RF-based model when the model uses the PBs as predictors. In particular, the correlation between measured and predicted Ψstem from the calibration dataset was higher (r = 0.95) than the correlation from the testing dataset (r = 0.89).Figure 6. Pearson’s correlation between measured and predicted Ψstem using the RF-based model and PBs as predictors.Support Vector MachineThe results indicate that the SVM-based model had the lowest accuracy results in predicting olive Ψstem when compared to other models (Table 3). This was supported by the Testing R2 and Testing nRMSE values both when using VIs (R2 = 0.19 and nRMSE = 19.80%) and PBs (R2 = 0.53 and nRMSE = 17.90%) as model predictors (Table 3; Figures S1 and S2).Multiple Linear RegressionConsidering PBs as predictors, the performance results of the MLR-based model are lower than those obtained with RF (MLR: Testing R2 = 0.57; RF: Testing R2 = 0.78) but very similar to those obtained with SVM (MLR: Testing R2 = 0.57; RF: Testing R2 = 0.53) (Table 3; Figures S1 and S2). Considering VIs as predictors, the MLR-based model performed worse than RF. On the contrary, the MLR-based model performed better compared with the results of SVM (MLR: Testing R2 = 0.57; SVM: Testing R2 = 0.19).Stem Water Potential Predictive MapUsing the RF-based model, a Ψstem prediction map was produced for each DOY of field measured Ψstem in both years (Figure 7). The figure shows high-resolution olive Ψstem prediction maps, using the RF-based model and the PBs as model predictors, at the different olive Ψstem field measurements. Most of the maps in Figure 7 show a distribution of Ψstem across the studied olive orchard in both years. Considering the maps of the 2021 season (Figure 7a–d), Ψstem values appear higher in June than the other three dates. On the contrary, considering the maps of the 2022 season (Figure 7a’–d’), Ψstem values appear higher in the middle of the season (July and August).Figure 7. High-resolution Ψstem prediction maps of the studied olive orchard derived from the RF-based model at the time of SWP measurements during 2021 ((a): DOY 178, (b): DOY 210, (c): DOY 231 and (d): DOY 293) and 2022 ((a’): DOY 164, (b’): DOY 206, (c’): DOY 241 and (d’): DOY 286) seasons.3.3.2. One-Year Models’ Training and EvaluationThe analyses conducted using the second approach (training on the first-year dataset and testing on the second-year dataset) did not lead to notable results. The results of the model training and testing are detailed in Table 4.Table 4. Performance of the robustness of models trained on the first-year dataset.4. DiscussionIn this study, Ψstem was measured during two irrigation seasons in order to investigate the ability of the proposed prediction models to estimate olive Ψstem with reasonable accuracy, which can represent an economically viable option for olive growers and help them manage water resources more sustainably. The high variation in Ψstem (particularly in July and August) is in line with the results found in the literature [8]. Previous studies have highlighted that, as the olive tree is considered a drought-resistant species, a wide range of Ψstem in olive orchards can be expected under different cultivated conditions [44] and different cultivars [45]. In addition, Giorio et al. [46] highlighted that the olive tree is characterized by low hydraulic conductivity, which can be responsible for a high degree of variation in Ψstem in response to changing environmental factors [9]. The Ψstem range reported in this study agreed with the ranges reported by several other studies [47,48] for ‘Arbequina’ trees. Despite the variation, Ψstem values lower than −4 MPa were not recorded, perhaps due to some root absorption of water occurring at deeper layers of the soil profile, in line with the result reported by Alcaras et al. [49].In our study, we did not obtain notable results when the models were trained with the first-year data; this could probably be due to the limited size of the training dataset (the first-year dataset consists of 96 observations) [50]. Hereinafter, the discussion is focused only on the models trained after combining the data from the two experimental years.Several studies used satellite thermal data to monitor crop water status. However, thermal bands (e.g., bands 10 and 11, Landsat-8) are characterized by low spatial resolution, which could affect the applicability of the model in water status monitoring, particularly in fruit tree crop systems [51]. A review by Ollinger [52] highlighted that the difference in visible vs. NIR reflectance could be significantly related to various properties of plant density or canopy ‘greenness’. In this study, we used the full spectral measurements in the VIS, Red Edge, and NIR regions to improve Ψstem prediction accuracy in olive trees. Rallo et al. [53] indicated that the technological progress in the industrial production of hyperspectral sensors, characterized by a high number of contiguous spectral bands, has driven scientists to a more accurate analysis aimed at selecting specific wavebands that should be more sensitive to crop-related variables [54,55]. For example, using hyperspectral imagery, Zarco-Tejada et al. [56] demonstrated the ability of a VI, centered at 570 and 515 nm wavelengths, as a water stress indicator. Various studies have considered the full spectral information on the basis of multivariate statistical techniques to take advantage of an increased number of wavebands and to improve the prediction of crop-related parameters [53,57]; however, little research has considered PBs and VIs independently as model predictors in order to improve the model prediction accuracy. RF, SVM, and MLR were previously used [41] to predict the canopy nitrogen weight from individual multispectral bands and associated vegetation indices (VI). The authors found that both machine-learning models provided much better accuracy than linear regression. Regarding water status estimation, however, very few studies have been carried out on the applicability of machine learning techniques such as SVM and RF in determining crop water stress in different crops [58] using multispectral remote sensing data.These results show that the RF-based model, using PBs as predictors, is a good machine-learning technique to estimate Ψstem in the olive orchard using Planet satellite data. In fact, as it becomes easier to implement artificial intelligence algorithms, more and more studies focus on the use of machine learning that uses all available spectral bands [59], taking into account all the information included in the spectra [59,60]. Our findings suggest that the most important PBs to predict Ψstem with an RF-based model were B5 and B4. The high-importance variable found for B5 could be explained by alterations in leaf characteristics due to the water stress that could determine changes in optical properties in the specific spectral range of 600–620 nm. Carter et al. [61] reported that leaf dehydration could determine a change in the spectral response of the leaf around the yellow region. Furthermore, a vegetation index (Yellowness Index) was reported in the literature that was developed to assess chlorosis in stressed leaves by evaluating how the reflectance changes around 600 nm [62]. It should be taken into account that drought stress and the consequent reduction of water in the tissues reduce cell turgor and could lead to photosystem damage and chlorosis [63,64]. The findings related to the importance of the variables are specific to our study, field conditions, cultivar, and RF-modeling approach. Thus, they cannot be generalized; moreover, further research is needed to confirm or deny our findings. According to the authors’ knowledge, there have been no attempts in the literature to develop a reliable prediction model for the estimation of water status in terms of Ψstem in olive orchards using spectral bands and vegetation indices as model predictors through the machine learning technique. Nevertheless, this modeling approach has been widely used for the estimation of water status in other tree crops. In vineyards, for example, a study by Rienth and Scholasch [65] relied on a relationship between VI (e.g., NDVI) and crop coefficients to predict crop water status. In contrast, other studies [66,67] highlighted that VI with red edge (RE) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) positions are more related to crop water status. In agreement with our findings, several studies on vineyards [59,60] have suggested that machine learning techniques can provide more accurate results in predicting crop water status in terms of Ψstem when using single bands instead of VIs. In particular, the study of Laroche-Pinel et al. [59] tested five machine-learning algorithms to find possible relationships between stem water potential and data acquired from Sentinel-2 images (bands reflectance values and vegetation indices). The authors found that when using red, NIR, red edge', 'unique_identifier': 239}\n",

Download conference paper PDF1 IntroductionIndia is farming land. Over history,the greatest and higher farming achievementsinthe agriculture field are updated from time to time by using modernization. There is an urgent need to modernise traditional agricultural practices in India, as 60–70% of the country’s GDP is derived from agriculture. The groundwater level is lower because of unplanned water use [1]. The amount of water on earth is reducing day by day, and this is exacerbated by a lack of rain and a shortage of groundwater. One of the major issues in the world today is a lack of water. In every field, water is necessary. Water is necessary for daily living as well. One industry where a great deal of Agriculture demands water [2]. Water waste is the biggest problem in agriculture. Every time additional water is sprayed onto the fields. There are many methods for conserving water.The system aims to protect water and energy resources. It measures the water level and manages the device both manually and automatically. Agriculture has not sufficiently produced in comparison to population growth because of climatic changes and a lack of cleanness [3]. Water is pumped into fields at regular intervals using canal systems and ground well for irrigation, but there is no feedback about the water level in the ground. This type of irrigation is detrimental to crop wellness and development since some crops are much more dependent on the quantity of soil moisture.The node has been developed software as a side server. Used decision support features and interactionhave given information representing view results [4]. Machine learning techniquesused as a sensor node these data also be noted by Novel algorithm process. Thesealgorithms give the best result less error result. It’s a good approach to minimize water use and less water waste in the agriculture field.Fig. 1.Smart Irrigation SystemFull size image2 Related WorkArduino technology is used to control water flow in the system. With the help of sensors devicesto collect the statistical analysis data(UV ray sensors, temperature sensors, moisture sensors, humidity sensors) decideto collect data and predict data similarity. Using Kalman filter and noisy intermediate scaled quantum devices (NISQs) use to suppress noise for sensor devices generate loud noise [5]. Agriculture system work to notify the humanity and temperature, PH value by the sensors.Sensors informationto display on PC and LCD [2]. Introduced an easy outlook “Using an artificial neural network controller, automate irrigation control” ON/OFF controller system is given it [6]. But the ON/OFF control system is not Reliable giving the result is not satisfied and the system fails. However, It is now possible to adopt stronger and more efficient control thanks to ANN-based methods. ANN-based systems may save a substantial amount of resources (such as water and energy) and give optimal results consistently for all types of agricultural settings [7]. These controllers have the inherent capability to perform these tasks without the need for prior system knowledge. Created and put into use successfully together with a flow sensor. The DHT22 sensor, the rain sensor, and the soil moisture sensor [6].The sector that still makes up the largest portion of India’s GDP is agriculture. But when we look at the technology used in this subject, we find that the advancement is not significant [8]. Huge technical advances nowadays have an impact on a number of industry, such as agriculture, medicine, and others. In our nation, agriculture is the main industry. India’s primary source of income is agriculture; hence the growth of agriculture is crucial. The majority of irrigation systems are still manually operated in modern times. Traditional irrigation methods like drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation are readily available. To effectively exploit the water variety, these strategies must be paired with the Internet of Things. The Internet of Things facilitates information access and important decision-making [9]. The temperature and moisture contents of the soil is conveyed using a wireless sensor network that is linked to ZigBee [10]. GPRS is used to send data to a web server over a cellular network. Graphitic applications can be used to monitor data over the internet.Fig. 2.Block Diagram: of the proposed systemFull size imageAs seen in Fig. 2, sensors, a microcontroller, a Wi-Fi module, and an Android application can all be used to automate irrigation. The field is regularly monitored by the in expensive groundwater level sensor. The Arduino board is connected to the sensors. The user can control irrigation by using the sensor data that has been acquiredand transmitted wirelessly [12].The Smartphone application can be made to analyse the data it receives and compare it to the temperature, humidity, and moisture thresholds. Instead of automatically by the software without user interruption, a choice can be made manually through the software with user interruption. If the groundwater level is below the threshold value, the motor is turned ON, and if it is over the threshold value, the motor is turned OFF [12]. The sensors are wired to the Arduino. This gadget communicates using a wireless module, allowing the user to access the data using an Android app on his Smartphone, which can obtain sensor data from the Arduino through the wireless module [13]. Additionally, it offers a capability for scheduling watering. When the groundwater reaches a predetermined level, The user can plan when to water. The technology instructs users to maintain the threshold value based on data regarding the predicted pattern of precipitation and soil moisture. When the soil moisture reaches the set threshold value, the irrigation can be stopped automatically by the system. With this module, a water pump is connected by a relay switch controlled by a Wi-Fi node. The web service initiates node control for real-time monitoring through the adaptable web-based interface [14]. This web-based interface allows for manual and automatic remote control of the water pump.Smart Irrigation SystemMaximizing the use of water for crops is the main goal of an automated irrigation system using WSN and GPRS Module [9]. A wireless sensor network that is spread makes up this system. (WSN) that includes temperature and soil moisture sensors. Gateway units are used to manage sensor unit data, give commands to actuators for irrigation management, and transfer data from sensor units to base stations. An algorithm is proposed in the system to control the amount of water according to the needs and circumstances of the field. The actuator receives instructions from the microcontroller, which has been programmed, to control how much water flows through the valve unit. The entire system is powered by PV solar panels. The cellular network allows for two-way communication. A web application controls the irrigation through ongoing monitoring and irrigation scheduling programming. Web pages can be used to do this. The Bluetooth technology is described in the section that follows. A wireless sensor network crop monitoring program can be used by farmers to practice precision farming. The Micro controller, which is additionally integrated with the other electrical components mentioned above as shown in Fig. 1, as well as the water level sensor, which was previously included into the plant, is what makes this system work. The sensor collects data on the soil moisture and sends it along with other information to the microprocessor, which then activates the pump. Except that level. The microprocessor provides a signal to the relay module, which activates a pump and sends a specific volume of water to the plant, if the groundwater level drops below a predetermined level. The pump shuts off when there is enough supplied water. The role of the power supply is to provide power to the whole system, and the recommended voltage should fall between the microcontroller’s incoming supply range of 7 V to 12 V.3 Benefits of Smart Irrigation SystemSmart irrigation has a number of advantages over traditional irrigation methods, some of which could be summed up as less crop loss, reduced energy usage, high cost-efficiency, and high performance efficiency. Fig. 3 illustrates the advantages of IoT use in irrigation systems. One of the main benefits of IoT systems for irrigation is that they use less water. In addition, the vast majority of irrigation-related chores are automated with this approach, only the necessary water is used for irrigation, and waste is reduced. Traditional irrigation methods that required human intervention lost a significant quantity of water because the majority of handling and operations were done manually. Little to no human contact occurs with smart irrigation, and water is only used when and where it is actually needed. High cost-efficiency is one of its extra benefits, as less water is utilized and the procedure is carried out with higher precision, which lowers costs and overall expenses. The strategy also considerably reduces energy use because less hours are spent running the machines, and controlled breaks are taken during the process to reduce overall energy usage. Additionally, because resources are few and companies must manage costs to some level, The need to cut costs and save resources cannot be overstated. Smart irrigation takes into account costs, allowing for successful completion of linked activities while using less money. Last but not least, one of the extra advantages is that plants and crops receive only the necessary amount of water with enhanced irrigation efficiency and groundwater management, which reduces crop loss from insufficient or excessive watering.Fig. 3.Benefits of Smart irrigation System using IOTFull size image4 Impect of Sustainability on Smart Irrigation SystemIt is possible to view sustainability as a crucial component of irrigation systems. Balance between the three sustainability pillars must be maintained for any system to remain sustainable. Economic, social, and environmental sustainability are the three pillars of sustainability. The potential effects of irrigation systems on the economy, ecology, and society are depicted in Fig. 3. The organisations engaged in the specific sector and related operations must take these factors into account because the components of sustainability could be evaluated in various contexts and media. Making sure that irrigation activities don’t have a negative influence on the environment is one of the factors of sustainability. Irrigation is a vital part of the agricultural sector, but it is critical that the activities established for irrigation are developed in a way that does not endanger the health of people or wildlife. Additionally, water management may be included in sustainable irrigation systems. Water is used in agriculture, so it’s important to effectively manage and control the resource to reduce water waste.There are therefore new requirements on how irrigation is established and managed as a result of the push for sustainable and better food systems. Every irrigation system, from local to national, has the ability to increase agricultural output, increase water security, promote inclusive growth, and promote progress toward the SDGs.Pumping power is required to run drip irrigation systems. Different energy sources are used in the process to provide pumping power, which also has an adverse effect on the environment as a whole. When thinking about sustainable irrigation, it’s important to make make ensuring that energy use and environmental effect are reduced by implementing environmentally friendly operational practices. Organizations engaged in irrigation activities must place a greater a focus on solutions that lower costs, sickness, pollution, and other issues. When irrigation doesn’t deplete natural resources or human resources, It is possible to attain high irrigational sustainability. Sustainability in this sense may be largely related to financial and ecological considerations.5 The Smart Irrigation Systems’ Basic Architecture and LayoutIrrigation management and associated IoT solutions have been discovered to use multi-agent architectures pretty frequently and well. These distinct architecture categories aid in creating separation between the numerous constituent parts. In most cases, the layer of architectural elements determines how the architectural distinctiveness is established. For instance, a node that is currently at a higher position in the hierarchy may end up working as a broker for a node that is currently in a lower position. Many jobs and actions that must be carried out are assumed to be represented by functional blocks that make up the majority of designs. The administration, devices, communications, security, and services and applications are the main elements of these designs. The Internet of Things (IoT) systems are made up of many devices that can be used to control, monitor, detect, and take action on a variety of different tasks. Additionally, it is believed that these particular devices contain interfaces that allow connections to be made with other devices in order to convey the required data. In addition, it’s common practice to interpret the data gathered from a variety of sensors and apply the conclusions reached to a range of actuators.It has long been accepted that the IoT architecture may be divided into three main tiers. These layers fall into three categories: application, network, and perception. A new layer called the service layer has been added in connection to the network and application levels. This specific layer is put into place to store and process the data using cloud computing and fog. Additionally, numerous researchers have created and presented a variety of new architecture proposals, with Ferrández-Pastor’s four layered architectures being one of the most obvious.IoT’s architecture has traditionally been regarded as faulty. The four layers stated above are things, edge, communication, and cloud. The edge layer has been assigned in this concept to locate key applications and perform basic control actions. Regarding IoT irrigation systems, many tiered approaches have been used and put into practise, with varying degrees of success. The bottom layer often consists of actuators and sensor nodes, whereas the intermediate layer frequently consists of a gateway and allows data transport. Lastly, cloud services, apps, or databases make up the third tier of the architecture. Although these three are the most frequently used layers, they may also be distinct and vary with (Figs. 4, 5, 6 and 7).Fig. 4.Environment impact, economical impact social impactFull size image6 Difficulties and Potential OutcomeThings, edge, communication, and cloud are the four levels that generally make up the IoT architecture. This proposal’s edge layer has been located to facilitate criticism. This section covers the difficulties and potential of utilising machine learning. The creation of digital software programs and machine learning for smart irrigation systems to govern a variety of crops, notably to support sustainable agriculture, has a number of challenges. To address the food shortages, the overall food output must be raised. To meet industrial demands, Cotton and rubber need to be cultivated more as cash crops in particular when combined with sustainable materials to prevent soil pollution. Additionally, these issues pose a variety of challenges, such as the fall in agricultural labour, the shrinkage of arable land, the scarcity of water supplies, the consequences of climate change, etc. As urbanization takes hold worldwide, the Rural areas’ populations are aging and shrinking quickly. There are several potential applications for IoT technologies in agriculture and food production. IoT’s affordability, autonomy, portability, minimum maintenance requirements, effectiveness, sturdy construction, and dependability in smart irrigation are only a few of the many aspects that require more study. To ensure sustainable agriculture, these tools are highly valued. Agriculture and other stakeholder who use portable software solutions in conjunction with machine learning forecasting have a lot of opportunities (Table 1).Fig. 5.Icons for intelligent irrigation systems were collectedFull size imageTable 1. Experiment case analyseFull size tableFig. 6.System AlgorithmFull size imageThe software uses the Internet of Things to remotely monitor the entire farm. Program uses two different types of terminals and a sensor network. In order to save energy, nodes apply energy-saving algorithms. Data collection from the node to the base station is done through a tree-based protocol. A system with two nodes, One of them gathers information on all environmental and soil variables, while the other features a camera for photographing and monitoring crops. With this system, sensor values are calculated without taking climate into account. An application cannot be programmed by a system user. There is no system for controlling applications. [12].Fig. 7.Instruments for detecting moisture levelsFull size image7 ConclusionThe level of soil water must be taken into account when designing an intelligent irrigation system. The soil water level is influenced by a variety of environmental conditions, including air temperature, air humidity, UV radiation, soil temperature, etc. Because of technological advancements, weather forecasting accuracy has substantially increased, and changes in soil moisture may now be predicted using weather forecast data.This article presents a hybrid device learning-based smart irrigation architecture based on the Internet of Things to predict the soil water content. The created method uses sensor data from the most recent period plus information from weather forecasts to anticipate the soil water level for the upcoming days. The anticipated value for soil water level is more accurate and has a lower error rate.Furthermore, a standalone system prototype incorporates the forecasting approach. Since the system prototype is based on open standard technology, It is affordable. The auto mode allows a clever system to be further tuned for application-specific situations. We want to perform a feature analysis of water savings based on the proposed algorithm with many nodes and system cost reduction.The irrigation system’s effects on the environment should be considered.respect for and adherence to the Sustainable Development Goal sfulfil the three pillars’ ultimate goals (ecological, social, and economiceconomic). It’s important to prevent overuse of natural resources, which is possible with careful planning. Also, it must be assured that the cost of operation activities does no exceed the perceived outcomes in order to preserve sustainability. The costs associated with this continual automation and technological advancement are already quite effective and efficient, and they might be further decreased. The firm may be helped by a tendency toward green activities and functions to meet its objectives, and organisations may achieve great things if they place more of an emphasis on CSR.ReferencesVidyarthi, A.: Comparative analysis of linear regression, random forest and support vector machine using dataset.

Introduction\\nGlobal water resources are under great pressure from rapidly increasing demand due to the fast growing population and climate change (Kourgialas, 2021). Agriculture uses the major share (69%) of global freshwater resources (WWAP (UNESCO World Water Assessment Programme, 2021) and is the first sector seriously affected by drought. Drought is the most important stress factor limiting crop production worldwide (Debaeke and Aboudrare, 2004a). Drought can reduce soil-water availability, decrease crop yields, lead to crop failure, and even threaten food security (Lu et al., 2020). Moreover, in many regions of the world, water used for food production is inefficient. As a major agricultural country in the world, water shortages had brought huge challenges to agriculture production in China, and especially in the arid region of Northwest China. The interaction between food security and water resources necessitates the development of new approaches to better answer the question of increasing agricultural production while reducing the water demand (Smilovic et al., 2016). Effective hydrological evaluation can provide useful information on the occurrence of climate extremes (Abro et al., 2020).\\n\\nDrought usually occurs at the critical growth periods of the crop, resulting in the inability to meet crop water requirements and crop failure (Heim, 2002). It is an important measure to provide water to crop in time in the critical period of crop growth. Therefore, it is necessary to properly identify the critical periods of crop water demand during the crop growth cycle. If the critical growth periods of crops can be determined in agriculture production and precision irrigation can be implemented, agricultural water use will be effectively saved.\\n\\nIn general, identifying crop critical periods of drought stress requires collecting a large amount of field samples and data on crop growth losses under different levels of water deficit at a given stage (Wilhelmi and Wilhite, 2002). Although the crop water deficit can reflect the actual crop growth characteristics, it is time-consuming and costly to conduct lots of experiments. However, biophysical models can well address this dilemma (Williams et al., 2018, Yang et al., 2014). The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model is one of the representative models of predicting crop growth and yield processes by integrating the supply and demand of resources (Shukr et al., 2021a). Compared to other crop models, APSIM emphasis on the continuous simulation of soil nutrient dynamics. Therefore, APSIM model able to analyze soil water dynamics in arid areas and has good accuracy for crop water requirement and water stress condition (Akponikpe et al., 2010, Holzworth et al., 2014a; Gaydon et al., 2017a). The model includes multiple modules of crops (including wheat, maize, and sunflower et al.), climate, soil, irrigation management, and field management practices, making it an ideal tool for investigating the response of crop yields to irrigation practices (Holzworth et al., 2014, Shukr et al., 2021b). It has been widely used in simulating the effect of water stress on crop yield. And extensive evaluations have been done about the APSIM model for environmental and crop management in Asia, particularly its ability to simulate individual crops (Gaydon et al., 2017b).\\n\\nUntil now, studies have been widely carried out to explore the influences of drought stress on crop growth and yield formation by setting various deficit irrigation treatments (Cakir, 2004a, Dreccer et al., 2018, Payero et al., 2009). However, these studies mostly have focused on the quantitative responses of crop evapotranspiration and crop yield to different drought levels, without concluding the most critical or the sequence of periods sensitive to drought stress. Most evaluation methods have quantified the sensitivity merely from one single index aspect, such as crop yield, water use efficiency, and production benefit, but rarely considered the index that affects the crop growth process. And WP is a comprehensive performance term at different management scales and is widely used in the optimal allocation of water resources (Comas et al., 2019, Kassam et al., 2007). The optimal time for wheat, maize, and sunflower to achieve maximum WP and maximum yield at the same time has not been determined. Grey relation analysis is an effective method to quantify the grey relation degree between alternative sequence and the reference sequence by considering the similarity or difference degree of each evaluation index (Cui et al., 2019a). However, grey relation analysis has not been used in the identification of crop irrigation priority. The reports on agricultural water irrigation priority strategies for wheat, maize, and sunflower crops have rarely been conducted.\\n\\nTo tackle the problems mentioned above, the objectives of this study were to (1) establish a multi-index evaluation method of the priority of crop irrigation; (2) identify the irrigation priority critical periods of wheat, maize, and sunflower in the crop growth period; (3) propose the irrigation priority for the three crops during the same period. This study can provide general guidance for scientific irrigation management of wheat, maize, and sunflower, mitigate drought risks and boost crop yield in the Hetao irrigation district and other regions under arid climate condition.\\n\\n2. Materials and methods\\n2.1. Method description\\nFig. 1 shows the overall framework of identifying the crop irrigation priority method based on APSIM crop model and grey relational analysis. Based on meteorological data, soil condition, crop information and field management, the APSIM crop model was used to simulate the growth process and soil water conditions of crops. The grey relational analysis method was used to evaluate the indicators obtained under certain irrigation treatments under four irrigation scenarios, and the grey correlation degree and ranking of each irrigation treatment was obtained. Eventually, it provides solutions for the rational allocation of water resources and preparing for drought.\\n\\nFig. 1\\nDownload : Download high-res image (557KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 1. Assessment methodology of water irrigation priority based of APSIM model and grey relational analysis.\\n\\n2.1.1. APSIM model\\nThe Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) model is a flexible framework that accommodates diversified environmental and crop modules via a plug-in mechanism (Gao et al., 2019). The APSIM model simulates crop growth at daily time steps. It contains a suite of modules to simulate an interactive system for crops, soil, climate, and field management (Moot et al., 2015). It is an effective tool to investigate the effects of water stress on crops, considering climate factors and their interaction with crop growth and yield formation processes, as well as crop management (Luo et al., 2018). And APSIM model has been extensively tested in the arid and semi-arid areas of Inner Mongolia, China (Fan et al., 2018). The SWIM module in the APSIM model is a software package developed within the CSIRO Division of Soils for simulation infiltration, movement, evapotranspiration, and redistribution (Keating et al., 2003). The soil module calculates deep drainage based on soil characteristics, which is suitable for areas with sallow groundwater. Connolly et al. (2002) has pointed out that SWIM can simulate soil conditions in more detail than most other soil-crop models.\\n\\nWe used APSIM version 7.9 (https://www.apsim.info/) to simulate the phenological development, soil water supply demand ratio (SDR), and final yield of wheat, maize, and sunflower in the study area under different irrigation scenarios and different irrigation treatments. Different irrigation scenarios were set based on the water demand of wheat, maize, and sunflower during the whole growth period. To determine the response of water deficit to yield, WP, and SDR, the APSIM model was run at ten-day intervals under extreme drought conditions. Nutrients were set to a non-limiting level in all scenarios. Therefore, crop growth and development are only affected by water. The SWIM model simulates the water supply demand ratio as a water stress index based on the plant-soil water balance (Chauhan et al., 2015). We obtained soil water stress factor from the module and simulated the effects of water stress on different growth periods of wheat, maize, and sunflower.\\n\\n2.1.2. Model calibration and validation\\nIn this study, APSIM model was developed on a point scale. Crop yield and soil moisture content were used to calibrate and validate the model parameters, in which the data from 2004 to 2009 were used for calibration, and the data from 2010 to 2016 were used for verification. After parameterizing the model, it was used to simulate the water deficit during crop growth period and the impact of water deficit on maize. Precipitation data are crucial for hydrological models employed for water resource management and drought monitoring. (Dehua et al., 2019; Shrestha et al., 2011). A typical drought year was determined by meteorological conditions, 2011, was selected as the baseline year (Xiaoxing et al., 2021), and the basic data used in the study were for 2011.\\n\\nTo evaluate the performance and accuracy of the model, statistical indicators of the correlation coefficient (R2, Eq. (1)), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE, Eq. (3)), and consistency indicator (D-index,Eq(4)) were calculated between the observed and simulated variables (Yaxu et al., 2020a). R2 and NRMSE reflect the difference between the simulated and measured values, where lower values indicate less residual variance. The model best reproduces the experimental data when R2 is 1. The simulation was considered excellent at NRMSE <\\u200910%, good at 10–20%, acceptable at 20–30%, and poor at >\\u200930% (Jamieson et al., 1991). D-index reflects the consistency between the simulated values and the observed values, with a range value of 0–1, 1 means perfect agreement, and 0 means complete disagreement.\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n(3)\\nWhere Yobsi is the measured value; Ysimi is the simulated value; Yobs is the average of measured values; n is the number of samples.\\n\\nCultivar parameters were derived using a trial-and-method that matched the observed phenology and grain yield.

Crop growth simulation of deficit irrigation\\nTo identify the critical period of water demand of crops, we ran a series of single season simulations for wheat, maize, and sunflower in 2011. The four deficit irrigation scenarios were 100%,70%,50%, and 30% of full irrigation. Deficit irrigation every 10 days (after sowing) was conducted for each crop in the whole growth period. There were 9 deficit irrigation treatments for wheat and sunflower, and 12 deficit irrigation treatments for maize. Irrigation time for maize is shown in Fig. 2. The same treatments were done for wheat and sunflower.\\n\\nFig. 2\\nDownload : Download high-res image (175KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 2. Irrigation treatments.\\n\\n2.1.4. Irrigation prioritization method\\nGrey system theory has been widely used in various fields because of its advantages in evaluating complex systems and establishing orderly relationships among indicators. Grey relational comprehensive evaluation is a system scientific theory developed based on the grey system theory (Deng, 1989a). It determines the correlation degree according to the similarity among the order curves. The steps for the evaluation are five steps: sequences determination, data dimensionless processing, evaluation matrix determination, weight determination of each index, and the comprehensive evaluation.\\n\\nStep 1. Determine the comparison and reference sequences. The comparison sequence was formed by the indicators of the SDR, WP, and crop yield under water deficit treatments. The canonical matrix \\n of evaluation indicator was defined as:\\n(4)\\n\\nThe reference sequence was composed of the minimum value of each indicator under all treatments.\\n(5)\\nWhere yj is the jth evaluation indicators of the reference sequence.\\n\\nStep 2. Indicator dimensionless. The averaging method was used for dimensionless processing, the ratio of the statistical value of the evaluation indicators to its mean value.\\n(6)\\n\\nStep 3. Calculate the grey relational coefficients. First, subtract the dimensionless value of each indicator of the ith comparison sequence by the jth reference sequence, and then process to absolute values. The grey correlation coefficient was calculated as (Cui et al., 2019b):\\n(7)\\nWhere \\n is the correlation coefficient of the jth of the comparison sequence; \\n is the resolution ratio, selected as 0.5 for guaranteeing a good calculation stability and a moderate distinguishing ability (Deng, 1989b, Singh et al., 2016).\\n\\nStep 4. Calculate the indicators weight. The dimensions of each indicator are different, so it is difficult to compare the degree of difference directly. The coefficient of variation of each indicator needs to be used to determine the weight of indicators.\\n\\nStep 5. Calculate correlation degree. Based on the methodology of GRA and the indices weight, the final calculation model can be deducted as:\\n(8)\\nWhere Ri is the correlation degree of the ith comparison sequence. wj is the indicator weight, calculated by the coefficient of variation method.\\n\\n2.2. Evaluation indices\\n2.2.1. The water supply demand radio (SDR)\\nSDR was a water deficit index, which is the ratio of the soil water supply (Ws) to the water demand (Wd) of crops. It was simulated by the model in a daily step, indicating the extent to which soil moisture extracted by roots meets the potential evapotranspiration demand. In the study, the mean SDR of deficit irrigation treatments at the whole growth period of the crops was considered as the intensity of the SDR ratio. SDR value is between 0 and 1. SDR was capped at 1 when Ws adequately met Wd and the crops were completely free from water stress. SDR dropped below 1 when the water could not meet the crop water demand. When SDR is 0, it indicates that the development process of the crop under water stress is terminated. The soil water supply (Ws) was calculated as follows (Chauhan, Rachaputi, 2014a):\\n(9)\\nWhere sw is the volumetric soil water content (mm mm−1); ll is the volumetric soil water content at the crop lower limit, kl is the root distribution factor. The water demand (Wd) corresponds to the amount of water that the crop would transpire without soil water constraint. It is related to the amount of water needed daily for crop growth (GCR) and the atmospheric water vapor pressure deficit (VDP) (Chauhan and Rachaputi, 2014b). Transpiration demand was modeled as a function of the current day’s crop growth rate.\\n(10)\\nWhere Te was a transpiration efficiency parameter in the model; GCR was the amount of water needed daily (mm); VDP was the atmospheric water vapor pressure (kPa).\\n\\n2.2.2. Water productivity (WP)\\nWater productivity (WP) is represented as the ratio of crop yield to actual water consumption. The actual water consumption (ETa) for each crop was simulated using the APSIM model. The calculation is as follows (Eq (7)):\\n(11)\\nWhere, Ys is the simulated yield of the crop (kg/ha); ΕΤa is the actual water consumption of the crop (mm).\\n\\n2.2.3. Yield loss due to water stress\\nWe calculated the difference between potential yields and simulated yields as the yield loss due to water stress. The potential yield in this study was the simulated yield under full irrigation condition. We assume that crop yield is only affected by water status during the growth period in this study. Other factors, such as infrastructure improvement and insects, were not considered. Yield loss was calculated as follows (Yaxu et al., 2020b):\\n(12)\\nWhere Rloss is the yield loss（kg/ha）; Ym is potential yield（kg/ha）; Ys is simulated yield（kg/ha）.\\n\\n2.3. Study area\\nHetao Irrigation District (HID) located in Bayannur City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China (latitude 40.1°N-41.4°\\u2009N, longitude 106.1°N–109.4°E), which plays an important role in food production in China. The HID is the largest primary artesian irrigation area in Asia, covers a total area of 1.22million ×\\u2009106 hectares, of which more than 60% is irrigated land (Chen et al., 2020), with an effective irrigation area of 800\\u2009ha, making it an important food production base in China (Wu et al., 2017). And the HID is the third largest irrigation district in China and consists of five irrigation subdistricts: Yigan Irrigation District (YGID), Jiefangzha Irrigation District (JID), Yongji Irrigation District (YJID), Yichang Irrigation District (YCID), and Wulate Irrigation District (WID). Here, we took the Jiefangzha Irrigation District (JID) as the study area, and its location is shown in the Fig. 3. The study area is a typical arid and semi-air area with a continental monsoon climate where the annual average temperature is 6–10\\u2009℃ (Xiaoxing et al., 2021). The mean annual precipitation is 130–250\\u2009mm whereas mean annual evaporation is more than 2100\\u2009mm and mean annual sunshine duration is 3181\\u2009h (Liu et al., 2015). Agriculture depends critically on irrigation water from the Yellow River (Juan et al., 2022). Spring wheat, spring maize, and sunflowers are the main crops in JID. Irrigation events are of great importance to satisfy the crop water demand and guarantee grain production in the region due to the special climatic conditions (Xu et al., 2010). The total area of the JID is 0.216 million hectares, of which 0.142 million hectares are irrigated by the Yellow River. From 1980–2015, a mean annual of 5.2 billion m3 of water diverted from the Yellow River for agriculture irrigation (Chen et al., 2018). A large amount of water diverted from the Yellow River for irrigation has resulted in a shallow water table and a high soil salinity. The water table depth varies between 0.5\\u2009m and 2.5\\u2009m with one year period and soil salinity of approximately 0.5\\u2009g/L (Li et al., 2020, Liu et al., 2017, Ren et al., 2016).\\n\\nFig. 3\\nDownload : Download high-res image (291KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 3. Location of the study area.\\n\\n2.4. Data sources\\nYield data for wheat, maize, and sunflower between 2004 and 2016 were obtained from Bayannur City Statistical Yearbook, Inner Mongolia. The daily meteorologic data were obtained from China Meteorological Data Sharing Center (http://data.cma.cn). It includes precipitation (mm), maximum and minimum temperatures (℃), and radiation (MJ/m2) (Fig. 4). Radiation data were calculated using daily weather data according to the Angstrom-Prescott formula. The total precipitation in JID in 2011 was 42.7\\u2009mm, and the total evaporation was 975.12\\u2009mm. Soil characteristics for location were selected from APSOIL database (www.apsim.info). The soil parameters involved in the model mainly include soil bulk density, withering coefficient, field water holding capacity and saturated water content (SAT), etc. The soil data from field measurement included the soil bulk density (BD) and soil texture (Liu et al., 2019, Wang et al., 2018). The SAT, the upper limit of drainage (DUL), and the lower limit of 15\\u2009bar (LL15) of different soil layers were calculated according to software Soil-Plant-Air-Water (SPAW) (Table 5).

The results showed that the simulated yield was in good agreement with the statistical yield. The values of NRMSE were all less than 10%.

The NRMSE values for soil moisture content in the whole growth period of wheat, maize, and sunflower were 12.03%, 12.06%, and 19.57%, respectively (Fig. 7). It showed that the models have an acceptable level of accuracy in simulating soil water dynamics processes. The results demonstrated that the APSIM model has good applicability in the study area and could be used to simulate the response of wheat, maize, and sunflower yield to water.\\n\\nFig. 7\\nDownload : Download high-res image (226KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 7. Comparison between simulated and observed soil moisture for crops.\\n\\n3.2. Priority of crop water irrigation\\n3.2.1. priority of crop water irrigation in phenology\\nThe priority of water irrigation for wheat, maize and sunflower were evaluated based on APSIM model and grey relational analysis, the results were shown in Fig. 8. The higher the evaluation value shown in the figure, the irrigation order takes more priority. The critical irrigation periods for wheat were 1–10\\u2009days, 40–50\\u2009days, and 50–61\\u2009days after sowing. The irrigation priority rankings for 100% and 70% deficit irrigation scenarios were similar: 40–50\\u2009days >\\u20091–10\\u2009days >\\u200950–61\\u2009days after sowing. The yields for these three periods decreased by 11.99%, 5.74%, and 4.21%, respectively, under the 100% deficit irrigation scenario, and decreased by 9.23%, 0.575%, and 2.43% under the 70% deficit irrigation scenario. No significant change in the SDR and WP was found under such two scenarios. The irrigation priority rankings for 50% and 30% deficit irrigation scenarios were as follows: 1–10\\u2009days >\\u200940–50\\u2009days >\\u200950–61\\u2009days after sowing. When deficit irrigation was applied 1–10\\u2009days after sowing, the maximum yield decreased by 5.77%, and the WP decreased by 0.134\\u2009kg/m3. In the 100% deficit irrigation and 70% deficit irrigation scenarios, the crop yield had the highest weight, which was 0.49 and 0.50, respectively. In the other two irrigation deficit scenarios, the weight of WP was 0.59 and 0.57, respectively.\\n\\nFig. 8\\nDownload : Download high-res image (443KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 8. Priority of water irrigation for crops.\\n\\nThe critical irrigation periods for maize were 20–30\\u2009days, 50–61\\u2009days, 61–71\\u2009days, and 71–81\\u2009days after sowing. When the deficit irrigation was 100%, the irrigation priority for maize was ranked as follow: 71–81\\u2009days >\\u200961–71\\u2009days >\\u200920–30\\u2009days after sowing. The maize yield decreased by 5.46% and 4.29%, respectively, for the first two periods, but increased by 2.54% for the period of 20–30\\u2009days since the water deficit at this period led to the prolonging of the growth period. The weight of yield is the maximum in the evaluation process, which is 0.39. Therefore, the 20–30 days after sowing of maize is the critical period of water demand. In the other three irrigation scenarios, the irrigation priority was ranked as follows: 61 days to 71 days >\\u200971 days to 81 days >\\u200950 days to 61 days after sowing. Under the 30% deficit irrigation scenario, the weight of crop yield and WP is the same, with a weight of 0.45. The weight values of crop yield under100%, 70%, and 50% deficit irrigation scenarios were the highest, which were 0.39, 0.422, and 0.40, respectively.\\n\\nThe critical irrigation periods period for sunflower was 20–61\\u2009days. Under the 100% deficit irrigation scenario, the irrigation priority was rank as follow: 30–40\\u2009days >\\u200940–50\\u2009days >\\u200950–61\\u2009days after sowing. During the three periods of deficit irrigation treatment, the yield decreased by 9.93%, 9.36%, and 3.16%, respectively. And the yield has a maximum weight value of 0.56. In other irrigation scenarios, the irrigation priority was rank as follow: 30–40\\u2009days after sowing >\\u200940–50\\u2009days after sowing >\\u200920–30\\u2009days after sowing. The crop yield is the most important factor in the process of determine irrigation priority. The weight values of yield were most important, which were 0.64, 0.63, and 0.72, respectively.\\n\\n3.2.2. Water irrigation priority for main crops\\nSince wheat, maize, and sunflower have different sensitive periods to drought, it is necessary to identify the priority of water irrigation for different crops to ensure crop yields under different drought conditions. We determined the irrigation priority of wheat, maize, and sunflower during their common growth period (from May to August) as shown in Fig. 9. The crops that grow in May are wheat and maize; The crops that grow in June are wheat, maize, and sunflowers; The crops that grow from July to August are maize and sunflowers. In early May, the irrigation priority under the 100% and 30% deficit irrigation scenarios was: wheat >\\u2009maize. Under the 70% and 50% deficit irrigation scenarios, the irrigation priority was: maize>\\u2009wheat. In mid - to late May, the irrigation priority under the 100% and 70% deficit irrigation scenarios was: maize>\\u2009wheat. Other irrigation scenarios, the irrigation scenarios in late May was: maize>\\u2009wheat. In June, the irrigation priority was: sunflower >wheat >maize. In late July, under the 70%, 50%, and, 30% deficit irrigation scenario was wheat >sunflower >\\u2009maize. From early July to mid-July, the irrigation priority was: maize >sunflower; but from late July to late August, the irrigation priority was: sunflower>maize.\\n\\nFig. 9\\nDownload : Download high-res image (504KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 9. Priority of water irrigation under different deficit irrigation scenarios.\\n\\n3.3. The effects of different drought levels on yield\\nFig. 10 shows the simulated yield of wheat, maize, and sunflower with four irrigated conditions. We compared the yield among three crops under different irrigation scenarios. For wheat and sunflower, the median maximum yield was achieved in the 30% deficit irrigation treatment, which indicated that appropriately deficit irrigation can increase production. However, the median yield of maize under 100% deficit irrigation and 70% deficit irrigation was the same, both of which were 11,475.2\\u2009kg/ha, higher than the other two scenarios. The median yields of wheat under 30% deficit irrigation, maize under 100% and 70% deficit irrigation, and sunflower under 30%deficit irrigation were 6666.7\\u2009kg/ha, 11,475.2\\u2009kg/ha, and 3388.7\\u2009kg/ha, respectively. In conclusion, yield of wheat and sunflower reached the maximum under 30% deficit irrigation scenario; The maximum yield of maize was reached under 100% and 70% deficit irrigation.

Unreasonable irrigation will not effectively improve crop yield but will cause a waste of water resources and a decrease in water productivity. The objectives of this study were intended to investigate the variability of yield and water productivity (WP) as a function of irrigation amount, time, and frequency and to explore optimal irrigation of winter wheat for improving grain yield and water productivity over a 60-year of long-term meteorological data (1961—2020). A water-driven model, AquaCrop model, was used to reproduce crop growth and yield responses to changes in water supply, with a total of 625 irrigation scenarios of irrigation amount and time. The results showed that there has been no significant change in seasonal ET0 (reference evapotranspiration) of winter wheat over the last 60 years. Instead, seasonal precipitation during the winter wheat growing cycle displayed a decreasing trend, potentially increasing the risk of meteorological drought. Despite the crop ET has remained stable at around 370 mm for the past 60 seasons, the grain yield and WP have steadily increased as the cumulative temperature increased. In all three typical meteorological years, crop average yield and ET were considerably improved under irrigation conditions compared with that in non-irrigated (rainfed). The total irrigation amounts of 90, 120, and 150 mm with two irrigation times in the wet, normal, and dry years, respectively, could achieve higher yields as well as the WP and IWP. Consequently, the optimal irrigation schedules in the wet, normal, and dry years were determined to be first irrigation in the wintering stage with 90 mm and second irrigation in the jointing stage with 0, 30, 60 mm, respectively. This work demonstrates that the AquaCrop model has a reliable accuracy for revealing crop growth and production under water deficit conditions and provides a technical means of application for formulating optimal irrigation schedules.\\n\\nPrevious article in issueNext article in issue\\nKeywords\\nAquaCropIrrigation scheduleYieldWater productivityWinter wheat\\n1. Introduction\\nWinter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a major crop grown in the Guanzhong Plain, an important cereal production area in Shaanxi Province. The Guanzhong Plain accounts for approximately 9% of the total area and 47% of the total cultivated land of the province but produces about 89% of the total wheat grain production in the province (NBSC, 2020). In this semiarid or sub-humid area, the source of water supply for the winter wheat growth and yield is primarily dependent on available precipitation and/or irrigation. Although annual precipitation is around 650 mm, the unevenly spatial and temporal distributed precipitation results in only 230 mm (half of the required water amount) during the winter wheat growing season (October–May). Meanwhile, irrigation in this area is inadequate, as only half of the arable land can be irrigated. In 2019, the unit yield of winter wheat in this region was only 3.9 t ha-1, well below the average level of the county (5.6 t ha-1) (NBSC, 2020). Therefore, there is an urgent to improve water productivity (WP) and productivity in response to growing pressures on water resource shortage.\\n\\nSince the last century, how to allocate limited irrigation water for wheat during the growing cycle to achieve maximize yield, water productivity, or profits was a tough problem due to the variability in soil and environment (Zhang et al., 2017). In general, a high yield was often matched with a high irrigation amount and low water productivity. Deficit irrigation, one of the water-saving irrigation strategies widely used in water-scarce areas, rationally supplies irrigation during the sensitive or critical crop growth stage to achieve high yield or prevent a major no significant decline in yield production (Kang et al., 2000). Since the 2000s, extensive field experiments have been carried out all around the world to investigate wheat growth and yield response to deficit irrigation (Kang et al., 2002, Li et al., 2005, Chen et al., 2010, Tari, 2016, Thapa et al., 2019). Other studies also proposed empirical production functions of water supply (or water consumption) and crop yield, such as linear (Dar et al., 2017), quadratic (Li et al., 2005, Wang et al., 2013a), negative exponential (Cooper et al., 2020) functions. However, a common issue in these experiential studies was that the results were usually site- and season-specific, making extrapolation beyond the location and climate unreliable. Different crop responses could result from the same irrigation schedule in diverse regions, soil types, and climates (seasons).\\n\\nBased on the advance of crop water requirements mechanisms, the simulation models were developed to elucidate how crop growth and production responded to the various soil-water environments. Some studies integrated optimization methods into a simply coupling system of crop water production functions and soil water balance. For example, Shang and Mao (2006) developed a simulation–optimization model for optimal irrigation timing and proposed different irrigation scenarios for three initial soil water storage layers of 0—1 m. Wen et al. (2017) proposed a simulation-based optimization model for optimizing spring wheat irrigation scheduling under mulching conditions. Although the global optimum solution could be obtained in the simulation–optimization model by some optimization algorithms (e.g. genetic algorithms, simulated annealing algorithms), the pure crop water production functions were simplified and empirical that unlikely to be sufficiently generic (Li et al., 2018), and some of the scheduling may difficult to implement in irrigation management in practical application. For instance, Shang and Mao (2006) proposed total of five times irrigation during the winter wheat growing season of March to May in North China, which was arduous by the border irrigation.\\n\\nCrop growth models, also known as agroecosystem models, have been developed over the last few decades from single physiological growth process simulation to the whole growth process and have been updated and refined to simulate the dynamic of variables of interest under various water-fertilizer conditions, and field management practices. In the recent studies, most of well-known models have been calibrated, evaluated, and validated the performances to simulate crop growth and yield production under various soil water conditions and irrigation scenarios, e.g. DSSAT-CERES-Wheat (Attia et al., 2016, Zhou et al., 2018), SWAP (Eitzinger et al., 2004, Wang et al., 2021), AquaCrop (Iqbal et al., 2014, Toumi et al., 2016), APSIM (Chen et al., 2010, Ahmed et al., 2016), and RZWQM2 (Saseendran et al., 2015, Xu et al., 2020). In addition to the evaluation of the model by experimental data, other researchers focused on the model application for long-term simulation (Chen et al., 2010, Attia et al., 2016, Xu et al., 2020).\\n\\nDifferent crop models have essential differences in crop response to water stress. For instance, the DSSAT and RZWQM2 model interpreted water stress by two stress factors that linear related to potential transpiration and potential root water uptake (Jones et al., 2003). The SWAP model described the deterioration inducing by the water stress for crop canopy assimilation and senescence based on soil water potential (Van Dam et al., 1997). Compared with other models, the AquaCrop model is a water-driven model, which accounted for the effects of soil water deficit on various growth processes, i.e., canopy expansion, canopy senescence, stomatal conductance, and harvest index. Moreover, multiple stress functions (e.g. linear, convex, and logistic) could be selected to reproduce the response of different crops to soil water variations. Since the release of the model in 2009, hundreds of studies have been published to test, validate and apply for a variety of purposes (e.g. characterizing the crop response to water stress, developing deficit irrigation schedules, improving farm irrigation management, and assessing the potential increase in production) (Vanuytrecht et al., 2014).\\n\\nNumerous studies have been conducted over the last few decades to evaluate and validate the performance of the AquaCrop for simulating crop growth and production, soil moisture variability around the world. Andarzian et al. (2011) validated the AquaCrop model to simulate wheat under deficit water conditions in a hot dry environment and suggested applying four irrigations (200 mm) for wet and normal years and six irrigations (300 mm) for dry years. Wang et al. (2013b) evaluated the AquaCrop model for simulating winter wheat under five irrigation treatments on China’s Loess Plateau, who reported two irrigations on over-wintering and turning green stags could save water without reducing yields. Iqbal et al. (2014) tested and validated the ability of AquaCrop model to simulate wheat growth and production by both field experiments and long-term measured and demonstrated the model has a reliable accuracy. Furthermore, Toumi et al. (2016) not only evaluated the performance of AquaCrop modelling for different irrigations but proposed the threshold of the root zone water depletion of 0.6 could improve the wheat irrigation management. However, most of the studies only investigated the performances of a few pre-specified alternative irrigation scenarios and one of the best scenario (targeting higher yield, WP, or profits) was recommended as the optimal in the previous studies. Therefore, it was unclear if any other irrigation schedule that was not user-defined scenarios could achieve better results, or if the recommended irrigation schedule could perform consistent performance across the different meteorological seasons.\\n\\nTherefore, to explore optimal irrigation of winter wheat for improving grain yield and water productivity, the full permutations of irrigation amount and time with a total of 625 irrigation scenarios were comprehensively analyzed in this study. The AquaCrop model (Steduto et al., 2009), a famous water-driven crop simulation model developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, was used to reproduce crop growth and yield production. Furthermore, the 60 years of long-term meteorological data (1961—2020) covering the study area were also employed. The main objectives of this study were to: (1) analyze the dynamic of climate (i.e., temperature, precipitation, reference evapotranspiration (ET0)) and crop production (i.e., grain yield, evapotranspiration (ET), and WP) characteristics under both rainfed and irrigated conditions over the last 60 years (1961–2020); (2) investigate the variability of yield and WP as a function of irrigation amount and frequency; and (3) explore the optimal irrigation strategies considering crop yields, WP, and IWP in three typical meteorological years.\\n\\n2. Methodology\\n2.1. Study area\\nThe study focused on the Guanzhong Plain, a conventional grain-based area with an area of about 5.5 million hectares located in Northwest China (34°00’N—35°30’N, 106°30’E—110°30’E) (Fig. 1). The climate is a semiarid warm temperature and continental monsoon, with an average annual temperature of approximately 12—13 °C, and water surface evaporation of 800—1000 mm. The elevation ranges from 325 to 900 m, with an average of 500 m. The average annual precipitation in this region is 650 mm, while the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall is uneven, with about 70% of precipitation falling in the summer season (June to September). Soil texture is a moderately well-drained loamy classified as the loam and silt loam according to the Harmonized World Soil Database (http://www.fao.org/land-water/databases-and-software/hwsd/en/), containing approximately 20% clay, 45% silt, and 35% sand. The average field capacity, wilting point, bulk density, and pH are 33% cm3 cm−3, 10% cm3 cm−3, 1.41 g cm−3, and 7.8, respectively (Zhang et al., 2018).\\n\\nFig. 1\\nDownload : Download high-res image (123KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 1.

Typically, winter wheat is planted from mid-October to early-June of the following year and summer maize is sown as soon as when wheat is harvested from June to October. Normally, irrigation is not required during the maize growing season, except for extreme drought events. However, during the winter wheat growing season, effective precipitation is less than 200\\u2009mm (Less than half of the crop water demand), restricting wheat production. Moreover, more than 50% of farmland relies on rainfed mainly located in the east and most irrigated farming is distributed in the west and middle (Zhou et al., 2020).\\n\\n2.2. Field experiment\\nA deficit irrigation experiment was conducted for two consecutive years (2013–2015). Different irrigation quotas and timings were designed to respond to various water stress degrees. Two irrigation levels of 80\\u2009mm and 40\\u2009mm were planned according to the winter wheat water demands (Chen et al., 2006). Three irrigation timings during winter wheat growth stages were applied. Hence, a total of eight deficit irrigation treatments were implemented, with each of three replicates (Table 1). Winter wheat was planted on 15 October 2013 and 2014, and the final harvests were on 7 June 2014 and 2 June 2015, respectively. The plot size was 4\\u2009m\\u2009×\\u20092\\u2009m with 0.4\\u2009m adjacent space, and all treatments were randomly assigned. A 1.5\\u2009m deep waterproof layer was placed between each plot to prevent soil water exchange. Besides, a mobile shelter was equipped to exclude rainfall from getting in the plots.\\n\\nTable 1.

The measurements were taken from the average of three readings across the plot. The canopy cover was calculated from the LAI using an empirical equation provided by Nielsen et al. (2012). The aboveground biomass was measured after LAI measurements and the dry matter was determined by drying about 15 plants at 75\\u2009°C for 72\\u2009h. Grain was harvest at full maturity stage within 1\\u2009m2 area and the yield was taken by threshing and air-drying to constant weight.\\n\\n2.3. Model description\\nThe AquaCrop model was mainly focused on simulating the crop aboveground biomass and grain yield production as a function of water productivity (WP). Based on the previous water production function proposed by Doorenbos and Kassam (1979), the AquaCrop evolved this approach and separated the ET into crop transpiration (Tr) and soil evaporation (E) to avoid the confounding effect of nonproductive consumptive water use (E) (Eq. (1)) (Steduto et al., 2009).\\n(1)\\nwhere B is cumulative aboveground biomass production (kg m-2), WP is the water productivity (kg (m-2 mm)), and Tr is the daily crop transpiration (mm day−1).\\n\\nSimilar to other crop models, the AquaCrop model assembled a soil–plant–atmosphere continuum (SPAC) for water interaction in daily steps by coupling three basic modules of soil water budget, crop growth, and atmosphere components (Araya et al., 2010). Additionally, some management practices, such as irrigation, fertility, and weeds, that impact on crop development and grain production were also referred. The main processes of crop development and grain production were as follow: (1) crop development. AquaCrop used canopy cover (CC) to describe crop development rather than leaf area index and to calculate crop transpiration during leaf expansion, aging and senescence. (2) crop transpiration. AquaCrop determined crop transpiration by multiplying the ET0 by a crop coefficient. The ET0 could be calculated by the FAO Penman-Monteith equation using several weather variables. The crop coefficient was proportional to CC and adjusted with crop canopy development. (3) aboveground biomass. The biomass was accumulated as a function of crop transpiration and water productivity (Eq. (1)). The normalized water productivity (WP*), related to atmospheric evaporative demand and air CO2 concentrations, was used to make the model valid for different climates including future climate scenarios (e.g. Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP)) (Hsiao et al., 2009). In AquaCrop, the WP*\\u2009was set to a constant of 15–20\\u2009g\\u2009m−2 for C3 crops like cereal wheat (Raes et al., 2009c). (4) grain yield formation. The yield was partitioned from biomass by means of the Harvest Index (HI). The HI in AquaCrop is not a constant but gradually linear increase to the reference Harvest Index (HIo) (cultivar specific) starting from flowering to maturity.\\n\\nAs mentioned above, AquaCrop is a water-driven model that specifically describes the effects of soil water changes on crop growth. With the exception of temperature, fertility, and salinity stresses, five water stress coefficients were incorporated into the model to update transpiration, canopy expansion, harvest index, and root expansion, etc. Further detailed descriptions of model mechanism and application were reported by (Hsiao et al., 2009, Raes et al., 2009b, Steduto et al., 2009).\\n\\n2.4. Input data and parameters determination\\nThe input data of the AquaCrop model version 6.1 could be divided into two groups, driving variables and parameters, including meteorological data, crop data, management data, and soil data. The descriptions and definitions were as follows:\\n\\n2.4.1. Weather data\\nThe meteorological data was used to drive the model interacting with crop and soil. Five kinds of variables of air temperature (maximum and minimum), relative humidity, wind speed, rainfall, and sunshine hours/radiation were minimum inputs into the AquaCrop model. The daily ET0 was calculated from these factors by ET0 calculation, an integrated module based on the FAO Penman-Monteith method (Allen et al., 1998). A long-term historical meteorological data (1961—2020) covering the study area was gained from the China Meteorological Data Service Center (http://data.cma.cn).\\n\\nDifferent climatic conditions have significant effects on crop growth. As a result, three typical meteorological years (hydrological year/ precipitation year) of the wet, normal, and dry years were considered in this study. The method of drought index (DI) (Guo et al., 2012) was used as Eq. (2) to evaluate variations of precipitation among different years:\\n(2)\\nwhere P is the precipitation (mm), M is the average precipitation of years 1961—2020 (mm), and σ is the standard error for precipitation. DI differentiated typical meteorological years as the wet (DI > 0.35), normal (− 0.35\\u2009≤ DI ≤ 0.35), and dry (DI < − 0.35) years.\\n\\nTo eliminate the influence of the precipitation data outside the winter wheat growth stage, the precipitation data during the winter wheat growth season (from October to May of the following year) was used in calculating DI. Finally, 19 wet years, 19 normal years, and 21 dry years were achieved with the average values of 305\\u2009mm, 235\\u2009mm, and 177\\u2009mm, respectively. The monthly precipitation and corresponding mean air temperature in three typical meteorological years during winter wheat growing seasons were depicted in Fig. 2.\\n\\nFig. 2\\nDownload : Download high-res image (266KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 2.

The line and square within the box represent medium and mean values, respectively. (Similarly hereinafter).\\n\\n2.4.2. Crop characteristics\\nCrop parameters in the AquaCrop model were classified as conservative, cultivar specific, and non-conservative crop parameters (Raes et al., 2009a). Conservative crop parameters, such as the temperature or stress threshold and normalized biomass water productivity, did not change substantially with time, management practices, geographic location, or climate. Whereas, the cultivar specific and non-conservative parameters may need to be adjusted depending on cultivars, environmental conditions, and planting methods. During the decade, numerous studies have been worked to calibrate and validate AquaCrop model in the Guanzhong Plain region under various application conditions, such as irrigation (Teng et al., 2015, Silvestro et al., 2017b), remote sensing (Jin et al., 2017, Silvestro et al., 2017a), and mulching (Liu et al., 2017). Given that prior knowledge were achieved in most studies covering this study region and corroborated reliability of model parameterization. Related parameters were referenced directly and the calibration process would not be repeated. Winter wheat parameters determination and sources were presented in Table 2.\\n\\nTable 2.

Management practices\\nThe management data was an essential part in simulating field practices and events, which mainly included field management and irrigation management. In respect of the field management, the events of fertilizer, film mulching, weed infestation, and field runoff were involved. In this study, the soil fertility was treated as adequate that non-limiting for crop canopy, water productivity, and biomass production. Moreover, no film mulch was applied for winter wheat planting. The surface runoff was prevented effectively by soil bunds of 0.3\\u2009m height and excess water from irrigation and rainfall was assumed to be stored in soil layers. Weed was inevitable on farmland and applying herbicides to control weed was common practice. Hence, the level of weed management was put at ‘very good’, ranked second after ‘perfect’, and corresponding parameters (e.g. relative cover and weed stress degree) followed default.\\n\\nIrrigation management includes irrigation methods and irrigation events. Border irrigation, one of the surface irrigation techniques widely applied in this area, was employed in this study. Two important variables of application time and amount need to be determined in each irrigation event to develop a schedule. Lots of studies have been conducted in wheat physiology and ecology to investigate critical water requirement growth stage and reveal the growth response to water stress and reported controversial results for different critical water requirement stages, e.g. seeding stage (Yao et al., 2015), jointing stage (Zheng et al., 2016), anthesis stage (Li et al., 2005), and filling stage (Attia et al., 2016). Therefore, the critical water demand period of the entire winter wheat growing seasons was attributed to four phenological stages as over-wintering (Nov.—Feb.), Reviving green (Feb.—Mar.), Stem jointing (Mar.—Apr.), and Grain filling (May.). Based on the precipitation data during winter wheat growing in 60 years, the maximum and minimum precipitation were about 450\\u2009mm and 140\\u2009mm. respectively. The seasonal water demand of winter wheat was approximately 400—450\\u2009mm (Chen et al., 2006), which meant additional irrigation was unnecessary when precipitation was abundant, but much more water needed to be supplemented with a rainfall scarcity condition. Therefore, various irrigation amount gradients of 0\\u2009mm, 30\\u2009mm, 60\\u2009mm, 90\\u2009mm, and 120\\u2009mm were designed and arranged. Finally, a total of 625 irrigation scenarios have been produced to different soil water status (Table 3).\\n\\nTable 3. Simulated irrigation for 625 irrigation scenarios in winter wheat growing seasons.\\n\\nIrrigation scenarios\\tIrrigation time and quota (mm)\\tTotal irrigation amount (mm)\\nEmpty Cell\\tWintering\\tReviving\\tJointing\\tFilling\\nIS-1\\t120\\t120\\t120\\t120\\t480\\nIS-2\\t90\\t120\\t120\\t120\\t450\\nIS-3\\t60\\t120\\t120\\t120\\t420\\nIS-4\\t30\\t120\\t120\\t120\\t390\\nIS-5\\t0\\t120\\t120\\t120\\t360\\nIS-6\\t120\\t90\\t120\\t120\\t450\\nIS-7\\t90\\t90\\t120\\t120\\t420\\nIS-8\\t60\\t90\\t120\\t120\\t390\\n……\\nIS-623\\t60\\t0\\t0\\t0\\t60\\nIS-624\\t30\\t0\\t0\\t0\\t30\\nIS-625 (Rainfed)\\t0\\t0\\t0\\t0\\t0\\n2.4.4. Soil characteristics\\nThe two parts of groundwater and soil profile in the soil module should be filled in. The depth of groundwater in the study area was up to 20\\u2009m, which difficult to supply groundwater to crop growth by soil capillary pressure. Thus, groundwater was negated in this study. For soil profile, several soil characteristics, such as soil texture, thickness, and retention properties, were determined. According to the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD), two soil types of loam and silt loam were distributed in Guanzhong Plain. In the HWSD, soil was divided into topsoil layer with 0—30\\u2009cm depth and subsoil layer with 30—100\\u2009cm depth. Consequently, the same soil layers were arranged in AquaCrop model. The soil properties for inputting in the model were shown in Table 4.\\n\\nTable 4.

Model application\\nFollowing the preparation of all input variables and parameters, a packaged project file was created to simulate winter wheat growth and grain production using historical meteorological data spanning the years 1961–2020. The AquaCrop plug-in program was used for iterative runs of 625 irrigation scenarios. Other indicators in addition to the crop grain yield, such as the WP and irrigation water productivity (IWP), describing the ratio of water use of crop metabolism to water lost, were considered and evaluated to explore and determine the reasonable irrigation schedule. In crop production, the WP is defined as crop grain yield per unit water consumption as Eq. (3). The IWP is defined as the quantity of yield produced by one cubic meter of water supplied, which is also called irrigation water productivity reported by Molden (1997) (Eq. (4)). Furthermore, the maximum profits of crop production under different irrigation schedules were discussed. In the study area, a policy of tiered pricing mechanism for water use was implied strictly, indicating that the more water irrigation, the higher unit price paid (Eq. (5)).\\n(3)\\n(4)\\n(5)\\nwhere Gy, ET and I refer to winter wheat grain yield (kg ha-1), crop evapotranspiration (mm), and total irrigation amount (mm), respectively. Gp is grain price (yuan kg-1), Ip,1 and Ip,2 are basic water price and progressive water pricing, respectively.\\n\\n3. Results and discussion\\n3.1. Model performance evaluation\\nFig. 3 shows the simulated and measured canopy cover under eight deficit irrigation treatments during two winter wheat growing seasons. Results indicated that the simulated canopy cover had good agreement with the measured value in most cases in both growing seasons, with RMSE ranging from 4.9% to 10.4% and from 1.9% to 4.8%, respectively. Wheat canopy covers during the second year (average RMSE: 7.7%, RRMSE: 10.7%) were better simulated than that of the first year (average RMSE: 4.1%, RRMSE: 5.1%). Besides, the simulation accuracy for all 80\\u2009mm irrigation quota treatments (2013–2014, average RMSE: 7.4%, RRMSE: 9.9%; 2014–2015, average RMSE: 3.6%, RRMSE: 4.4%) was slightly higher than that of 40\\u2009mm irrigation quota treatments (2013–2014, average RMSE: 8.0%, RRMSE: 11.5%; 2014–2015, average RMSE: 4.5%, RRMSE: 5.7%) in two growing seasons. This expression was consistent with other studies reports that the performance of models would be decreased with the aggravation of water stress (Fang et al., 2010, Zhang et al., 2019a). The large discrepancies were mainly presented before around 180 DAP and well followed in the late stages. Overall, the global simulated accuracy by AquaCrop model referencing from previous studies in this region presented acceptable compared with the reports by others (Wang et al., 2013b, Toumi et al., 2016, Ran et al., 2017).\\n\\nFig. 3\\nDownload : Download high-res image (392KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 3.

In general, the AquaCrop model provided the dependable capability for revealing the variability of yield to water deficit and could be extrapolated to more irrigation scenarios.\\n\\nFig. 4\\nDownload : Download high-res image (81KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 4.

Despitesubstantial production, given that rice is a high water-consuming crop, the water shortage due to the irreversibledecline in available water resources on a global scale induced by undergoing climate change will pose gravechallenges to rice reproductive growth and related water resources utilization. As a consequence, investigatingthe responses of rice productivity and water consumption to more pronounced climate changes is of great signif-icance for water resources sustainable utilization in terms of reducing irrigation water requirements and ensur-ing food security. Present water footprint (WF) methods do not calculate the weighted average of each WFcomponent at the national level when evaluating the effects of prospective climate change upon rice production.The national water footprint (NWF), i.e. taking the share of each province in the total production of crops asweighting factors, has been regarded as an effective approach to determine where each WF component isoriginally located.

All rights reserved.1. IntroductionThe 2.7% of the earth's water that is freshwater is one of the mostessential elements for all forms of life that is closely related to the subsis-tence and development of human beings (Li et al., 2019). The consump-tion of global water resources increased approximately sevenfoldalongside the population of the world that has grown from 1600 millionto over 6000 million during the 20th century (Gleick, 2000).Despite mitigation measurements that have been conducted, globalwater resources will become more pressing to meet the expecteddemand for 50% more food by 2030, and thus cause broad public con-cerns (White et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2016). Among the looming chal-lenges, the most sensitive one is usually considered to be cropproduction (Cao et al., 2017; Huntiugton, 2006; Sun et al., 2016). Statis-tically, crop production constitutes 70% of the global water extractions,although advanced technologies have been promoted to improvewater utilization efﬁciency (Bocchiola, 2015; Grafton et al., 2018).With the exception of the increasing demand, the availability of waterresources greatly affects crop production, which has severe implicationsfor food security and human welfare, especially in developing countriesincluding China (Tuninetti et al., 2015). Against this background, re-cently, substantial efforts have been paid to investigate the inﬂuencesof water stress on agricultural production, particularly the morphology,physiology and biochemistry of crops (e.g., Bolat et al., 2015; Jiménezet al., 2013; Kalefetoglu and Ekmekçi, 2005; Kulak et al., 2019; Maet al., 2010; Rhodes and Nadolska-Orczyk, 2001; Sangwan et al., 2001;Yaşar, 2003). Globally, the adverse effects of water stress on crop growthand production, including limiting plant growth (Cetinkaya et al., 2017),impairing plant metabolism (Laribi et al., 2009), reducing photosynthe-sis (Gupta and Gupta, 2005) and restraining cell growth (Blokhina et al.,2003), and the beneﬁts such as more active secondary metabolite pro-duction (Yadav et al., 2012) and positive tendency in synthesis ofenzymes (Radwan et al., 2017), have been documented in literaturereviews (Kulak et al., 2019).In fact, apart from the crop growth, water resources utilization re-lated to crop production is also affected by irreversible decline in avail-able water resources on a global scale induced by ongoing climatechange (Wang et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2017). Attempts to investigatethe effects which climate variability exerts on water resources use in ag-riculture, such as crop water consumption and irrigation water require-ment and efﬁciency, have been widely conducted, especially in recentdecades (e.g., Cong et al., 2008; Ding et al., 2017; Döll, 2002; Fischeret al., 2007; Luo et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2014a; Yang et al., 2013). Pro-viding a quantiﬁable indicator, the key factor that will measure the vol-ume of consumptive water use as a consequence of various growingdrivers in space and time, is the ultimate goal of characterizing the po-tential impacts of the amount of water embedded in crops for the entireagricultural production supply chain (Challinor et al., 2014; Zheng et al.,2018b). Hence, reliable estimation of the total amount of water requiredto produce speciﬁc crops is of increasing importance in agriculturalwater accounting (Hoekstra, 2013). As a quantiﬁable indicator to evalu-ate the interaction effects of ecophysiological processes on water con-sumption and water quality by crop production, water footprint (WF)is more feasible and reliable than other approaches (Zhang et al.,2014; Zhang et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2019).The notion of WF is proposed by Chapagain and Hoekstra (2002).Normally, WF is divided into three water components: green waterfootprint WFg, blue water footprint WFb and gray water footprintWFgr (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2010). The water footprint of a productexpressed in water volume per unit of product (usually m3/t) is the sumof the water footprints of the process steps taken to produce theproduct. The WFb refers to the volume of surface and groundwater con-sumed as a result of the production of a good; the WFg refers to the rainwater consumed (Nouri et al., 2019). The WFgr of a product refers to thevolume of freshwater that is required to assimilate the load of pollutantsbased on existing ambient water quality standards (Chapagain andHoekstra, 2011). Therefore, in contrast to the conventional approachof agricultural water resources evaluation for providing results inwater volumetric terms only (Lovarelli et al., 2016), WF also focuseson the amount of polluted consumptive freshwater arising in thegrowth period of crops (Li et al., 2018). For this purpose, researchingthe linkage between food and water resources sustainability (Zhanget al., 2018) with the help of WF, which is expected to mitigate thepressure induced by heterogeneity of available water resources, is im-perative to shape future agricultural sustainable development (Luanet al., 2018).Rice is one of the most important staple foods in the world, whichfeeds more than half of global population and 60% of the Chinese people(FAO, 2014; Xiong et al., 2013). With population growth, the rice yieldof the world increased from 285 million tons in 1961 to 741 milliontons in 2016 (FAO, 2018). This is especially true for China, which has145 million tons of yield and 30.16 million hectares of cultivated area,contributing 28% of the world rice yield and 19% of the global rice area(USDA, 2017). Apart from the substantial production, rice is submergedwith a thin layer of water during the long growth season (Peng et al.,2009) and thus consumes 50% of the global irrigation water (Yunuset al., 2013). This high water-consuming activity inﬂicts adverse effectson rice production, which is expected to pose severe risk to water andfood security in China and the rest of the world (Rodríguez et al.,2019). Therefore, investigating the responses of rice productivity andwater consumption to more pronounced climate change in differentagro-ecological zones will be a signiﬁcant path to synergistically man-age agricultural water resources and deserves further study (Zhanget al., 2014). Extensive studies have conducted to evaluate the climaticeffects on crop production and related water resources utilization,which characterize the amount of water needed to produce speciﬁccrops by means of WF in terms of quantifying the interactions of thewater-food nexus (e.g., Ababaei and Etedali, 2014; Chapagain andHoekstra, 2011; Mali et al., 2017; Silalertruksa et al., 2017; Yan et al.,2015; Yoo et al., 2013, 2015). Present WF methods do not calculatethe weighted average of each WF component on the national level,either conceptually or mathematically, when investigating the re-sponses of crop WF to natural factors and anthropogenic activities aswell as the changes in composition. Use of the share of each provincein the total production of crops as weighting factors through employingthe national water footprint (NWF) approach, has been implemented inthe WF assessment of crops (e.g., Ababaei and Etedali, 2014, 2017; Sunet al., 2013; Yoo et al., 2013). In these studies, little investigation wasdevoted to the variation and composition of NWF for rice with diversespatial patterns, especially in China. More importantly, to date, a com-prehensive assessment of NWF for single-rice and double rice (early-rice and late-rice) across China is still missing. Hence, in-depth studyon the eco-physiological and hydrological response of rice with theknowledge of NWF is a novel approach to improve the sustainability2J. Zheng et al. / Science of the Total Environment 739 (2020) 140032of water resources utilization and productivity, which is imperative,thus motivating our present research. This study distinguishes for theﬁrst time in a rice NWF assessment single-rice (SR), early-rice (ER)and late-rice (LR). The pioneering work is beneﬁcial for tackling thechallenge of alleviating pressures derived from rising food demandand limited water resources, then revealing the rationality of water re-source utilization and providing valuable information for reducing therice WF in China and the rest of the world.2. Materials and methods2.1. Study areaPrimary cropping systems of rice in China contain single-rice anddouble rice (double rice refers to the rotation between early-rice andlate-rice). The cropping systems includes eight zones (Single-rice I, II,IV and V; Early-rice III and VI; Late-rice III and VI). The study area ismainland China, which excludes the Taiwan Province, Hong Kong andMacao (Fig. 1).2.2. Data collectionThe phenology and climate data of rice were obtained from Chinaagro-meteorological experimental stations and the China meteorologi-cal data sharing service system, respectively. The data include 127 sta-tions for single-rice and 80 stations for double rice during the periodof 2001–2010. The nitrogen application rates, yield and productionarea were obtained from the National Bureau of Statistics of China(see Tables 1 and 2).2.3. Water footprint accountingThe WFb, WFg and WFgr were calculated following the calculationframework provided by Hoekstra et al.

Zheng et al. / Science of the Total Environment 739 (2020) 140032application rates (kg/ha), ETgreen and ETblue represent green and blue wa-ter evapotranspiration and the total effective precipitation; ETc is cropevapotranspiration during the crop growing period (mm); Pe is the ef-fective precipitation over the crop growing period (mm). Consideringthe maximum allowable concentration (CMax, in mg/L) of nitrate on sur-face and in groundwater, adopting the standard allowable concentra-tion of 10 mg/L recommended by the USEPA (Chapagain et al., 2006).Moreover, since there is no data or model simulations on this spatialscale, the natural nitrogen concentration (CNat in mg/L) is conservativelyassumed as zero. According to the assumptions of Chapagain et al.(2006) and Hoekstra et al. (2011), α is rate of leached nitrogen, usedin this study is 10%.ETc is the total amount of evaporation and transpiration during therice growing period. The ETc is calculated by the single crop coefﬁcientmethod (Allen et al., 1998):ETc ¼ kc  ET0ð6Þwhere kc is the crop coefﬁcient (dimensionless); ETo is the referencecrop evapotranspiration (mm/d). The FAO Penman-Monteith (P-M)method is used to calculate ET0 (Allen et al., 1998).Pe is the portion of the total precipitation, as rainfall and snowmelt,that is available to the crop and does not run off, which is very difﬁcultto determine without detailed site-speciﬁc information. Therefore, asimple method developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (Dölland Siebert, 2002) and improved by Li et al. (2018) was used as follows:Pe ¼fP 4:17−0:2PðÞ=4:17;Pb8:34:17 þ 0:1P;P≥8:3ð7Þwhere P is the total precipitation (mm) at a daily time step.2.4. Estimation of national water footprint componentsThe estimation of national WF components is to take the share ofeach component in the total rice production of all studied provinces asa weighting factor and take the average value of all provinces(Eqs. (8)–(9)). Finally, the volume of each WF component at the na-tional level was calculated as a weighted average of the proportion ofeach WF component in the total national production (Eqs.

Results3.1. Variation of ETc, Pe and IWRThe ETc and Pe are the most important parameters for calculating theWF. Fig. 3 shows the variation of ETc, Pe and irrigation water require-ment (IWR) of rice during 2001–2010 in six agro-ecological zonesacross China. The variation of Pe for eight zones during the period of2001–2010 ranges from 90 mm to 260 mm. The maximum value is inSR-V (254.97 mm), and the SR-IV (225.85 mm) took second place,followedbyER-VI(204.64mm),SR-II(173.11mm),SR-I(170.31 mm), ER-III (159.52 mm), LR-VI (119.85 mm) and LR-III(95.37 mm). The ﬁve zones presented an upward trend (SR-I, SR-II,LR-III, ER-VI and LR-VI), and the linear increase rates were 1.86 mm/annum, 3.53 mm/annum, 0.04 mm/annum, 0.08 mm/annum and0.19 mm/annum, respectively. SR-IV, SR-V and ER-III exhibited a down-ward trend with linear decline rates 0.44 mm/annum, 2.76 mm/annumand 1.01 mm/annum, respectively.The change of ETc for eight zones during the period of 2001–2010ranges from 420 mm to 650 mm.

Zheng et al. / Science of the Total Environment 739 (2020) 140032(645.9 mm), and the SR-I (638.1 mm) was second highest, followed bySR-II (618.6 mm), SR-IV (598.1 mm), ER-VI (483.4 mm), LR-II(450.3 mm), LR-VI (431.6 mm) and ER-III (421.9 mm). Moreover, fourzones exhibited an upward trend (SR-V, ER-III, LR-III and LR-VI), andthe linear increase rates were 3.13 mm/annum, 1.55 mm/annum,3.62 mm/annum and 3.41 mm/annum, respectively. While the SR-I,SR-II, SR-IV and ER-VI showed a downward trend with linear decreaserates 3.43 mm/annum, 2.62 mm/annum, 1.47 mm/annum and3.03 mm/annum, respectively. The changes of IWR were consistentwith the ETc; however, comparing with Pe and ETc, the variation rateof IWR was higher.3.2. Spatiotemporal changes and interannual proportions of WF for riceWF reﬂects a region's water utilization and agricultural productionstates. Fig. 4 suggests that the WFb tended to decrease in most zones,while the WFg presented an upward trend, with the variations of WFbfor eight zones ranging from −31.9% to 17.3%, with a variability be-tween −25.1% and 52.6% in WFg, that was strongly non-uniform inspace. Moreover, for eight zones, under the combined inﬂuences ofETc and Pe, the interannual variations of WF showed obvious ﬂuctuation.The value of WF rank as SR-V N SR-I N ER-VI N SR-IV N LR-III N LR-VI N SR-II N ER-III.The explicit distinction between WFb and WFg will enable a betterunderstanding of the impacts of climate change and human activityon agricultural water resources. Figs. 5 and 6 present the shares ofWFb and WFg of rice in the agro-ecological zones across China for theperiod of 2001–2010. For single-rice, the proportion of WFb is typicallygreater than WFg. The share of WFb ranges from 21% to 82%. However,in zone SR-V, a new phenomenon appeared that green water is higherthan that of blue water (see Fig. 5). While for early-rice, the proportionof WFg is typically greater than WFb. The share of WFg ranges from 10%to 61%. However, in Zhejiang province of zone ER-III and Hainan prov-ince of zone ER-VI, an opposite phenomenon appeared that bluewater is higher than that of green water (see Fig. 6A). Identical tosingle-rice, the proportion of WFb for late-rice is substantially greaterthan WFg. The share of WFb ranges from 29% to 85%. However, in Hainanprovince of zone LR-VI, a different situation occurred with blue waterequal to that of green water (see Fig. 6B).3.3.

For single-rice, the AWF of WFb ranged from 550.0 to679.3 m3/t, the WFg from 434.6 to 564.4 m3/t, and the WFgr from476.8 to 695.6 m3/t. For early-rice, the AWF of WFb ranged from 742.6to 1066.6 m3/t, the WFg from 275.8 to 376.1 m3/t, and the WFgr from149.1 to 270.1 m3/t. For late-rice, the AWF of WFb ranged from 513.4to 717.6 m3/t, the WFg from 250.3 to 275.7 m3/t, and the WFgr from236.6 to 267.0 m3/t. While for WAWF, the WFb varied between 529.7and 631.6 m3/t, the WFg varied between 561.9 and 771.5 m3/t, andthe WFgr varied between 410.3 and 545.2 m3/t.Fig. 8 exhibits the temporal change in NWF and TNWF of the WFcomponents of rice production. The TNWF of rice over the period2001–2010 was 304,848 MCM/year (33% blue NWF, 38% green NWFand 29% gray NWF). Moreover, the TNWF presented an upward trend,and the linear increase rates were 5769 MCM/annum.4. DiscussionIncreased water stress will make China a hot spot in terms of studieswith respect to the NWF, and thus drive the attention of policy makers.The current results with respect to the WF of rice production were com-pared to available documented literature (Table 4). As seen fromTable 4, WF in most research was not devoted to the classiﬁcation ofsingle-rice and double rice. In this study, to investigate the perfor-mances of the different rice cropping systems, the historical changeand composition characteristics of NWF for SR, ER and LR were assessedin eight agro-ecological zones (Single-rice I, II, IV and V; Early-rice IIIand VI; Late-rice III and VI) across China for the ﬁrst time. The quantita-tive approach of NWF conducted in the current paper is similar to thestudy by Ababaei and Etedali (2017), which is evaluated by calculatingthe weighted average of each WF component at the national level, pro-viding an effective tool to explore the nexus between food and waterthrough the quantitative description of water resources utilization re-lated to crop growth. In this research the concept of NWF is applied atthe national scale for the ﬁrst time in China. Therefore, the scope ofNWF in terms of speciﬁc crop and study area is extended.The differences in rice NWF accounting generally involve methods,regions, study periods and components. With regard to the WF compo-nent, scholars, namely Bulsink et al. (2010), He et al. (2010), Mekonnenand Hoekstra (2011), Xu and Zhang (2016), Yoo et al. (2013) and Zhuoet al. (2016) evaluated rice concerning WFb, WFg and WFgr, with ap-proaches similar to the present study. Separating the three componentsfrom each other could provide a complete evaluation of the water utili-zation related to crop production in terms of different impacts by bothnatural and anthropogenic factors. The study conducted by He et al.(2010) did not provide detailed values about the composition of WF.Mekonnen and Hoekstra (2011) pointed out that the term “water foot-print” includes both consumptive water use (the WFb and WFg) and thewater required to assimilate pollution (the WFgr). Because of the dis-tinct properties of the previous three components, several studiessuch as Gheewala et al. (2014), Marano and Filippi (2015) and Wanget al. (2014b) overlooked WFgr since considering WFgr is not a physicalquantity of water use, but associated with water pollution. Moreover, interms of measurement of WF, most papers are exclusively focused onWFb and WFg estimates due to data unavailability on WFgr. In fact,Fig. 5. Spatial pattern of water footprint for single-rice and its composition in 2001–2010.6J. Zheng et al. / Science of the Total Environment 739 (2020) 140032including WFgr is relatively new in water use studies, but justiﬁed whenconsidering the relevance of pollution as a driver of water scarcity.Meanwhile, the consumption of WFgr is equally important to the sus-tainable utilization of water resources and environmental governancein agricultural systems. In accordance with related work (e.g., Bulsinket al., 2010; Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2011; Xu and Zhang, 2016; Yooet al., 2013; Zhuo et al., 2016), the WFgr was considered in thepresent work.For the period 2001–2010, the NWF of rice was estimated at 304,848MCM per year which is around 82.6% of the total agricultural water re-sources withdrawal in China (369,149 MCM in 2010) (MWR, 2002-2011). Of this amount, the shares of WFb, WFg and WFgr were 33%,38% and 29%, respectively. The WFg accounted for the main share, andthe proportions of WFb and WFgr are smaller. More importantly, theWF of crop production depends on two factors: crop water utilization(CWU) and crop yield. Accordingly, a decline in rice WFb by 5.15 m3/tper year was identiﬁed due with the increase in yield and decline inCWU for blue water, indicating the importance of the reduction of con-sumptive blue water resources related to WF in rice production. In otherwords, the WF reﬂects the impact of crop production on water resourcesmore fully. Regarding the single-double rice cropping system, single-rice, early-rice and late-rice accounted for 50.4%, 25.1% and 24.5% ofthe NWF related to the production of rice, respectively. However, a de-cline in WF was identiﬁed at 7.59 m3/t per year for early-rice. Mean-while, the blue water proportion of single and early rice decreased inturn as well as the green and gray water proportion of both early andFig. 6. The blue and green WF compositions for double rice (early-rice (A) and late-rice (B)) of agro-ecological zones across China during the period of 2001–2010. (For interpretation of thereferences to color in this ﬁgure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)7J. Zheng et al. / Science of the Total Environment 739 (2020) 140032late rice decreased. Moreover, the unit yield of WF of double rice was36.1 m3/t less than the single-rice average, which indicates double ricehas more advantages than single-rice in effective use of water resources.Although rice WF in China are included in the literature above, thedominant reason why the values of WF in He et al. (2010), Wang et al.(2014b), Xu and Zhang (2016) and Zhuo et al. (2016) are not in agree-ment with the current study is the difference in research period andregion. Speciﬁcally, He et al. (2010), Xu and Zhang (2016) and Zhuoet al. (2016) deal with both provinces and basins rather than the entireChina, while Wang et al. (2014b) did not assess the WFgr and make thesingle-double rice distinction. Moreover, the WF of the current studywas investigated for the period of 2001–2010, whereas the value ofWang et al. (2014b) was reported for 2010. The WF of rice calculatedby Wang et al. (2014b) and Xu and Zhang (2016) were 1390 and 961Fig. 7. Trends in WFV for single-rice (A–C), and early-rice (D–F) and late-rice (G–I) of agro-ecological zones across China during the period of 2001–2010.8J. Zheng et al. / Science of the Total Environment 739 (2020) 140032m3/t, respectively, both of which are lower than the 1759 m3/t found inthe present study. The value from Zhuo et al. (2016) was 5803 m3/t,which is greater than the result in the current study.As seen from Table 4, WF in most studies ranged from 800 m3/t to2000 m3/t. However, the component consequences were quite differ-ent, such as the proportion of WFb in most research ranged from 18%to 60%; nevertheless, the share of WFb was 3.9% in Zhuo et al. (2016),which was 6.6% of the maximum value (60.3% by Marano and Filippi,2015). Meanwhile, the proportion of WFg in most research rangedfrom 30% to 75%; nevertheless, the share of WFg was 7.1% in Zhuoet al. (2016), which was 9.3% of the maximum value (76.2% byGheewala et al., 2014). Moreover, the proportion of WFgr in mostresearch ranged from 6% to 25%, but the share of WFgr was 89% inZhuo et al. (2016), which was 15.6 times the minimum value (5.7% byYoo et al., 2013). Compared with the current study, the estimate ofWFg obtained by Bulsink et al. (2010) was 2527 m3/t. Indonesia is lo-cated in the Paciﬁc region and across the equator where the average an-nual precipitation reaches 2000 mm. Hence, the WFg for that location issigniﬁcantly larger than other researchers found. In addition, the WFgrestimated by Zhuo et al. (2016) was 5164 m3/t, which is 107 times theminimum value (48 m3/t by Yoo et al., 2013).The large amount of fertilizer use is affecting the quality of land andwater resources. For instance, the Yellow River Basin has experiencedbooming agriculture, while the growing application of fertilizers in-creased the WFgr (Zhuo et al., 2016). However, the WFgr related tocrop production refers to the volume of water needed to assimilatethe nutrients leaching from agricultural\", 'unique_identifier': 247}\n",

The quantiﬁcation of these effects is meaningful for guiding relevant policies. However, fewstudies have explored systematic methods assessing changes of food production and water consumption and therelations between them, caused by cultivated land change. This study developed new spatially explicit datasetsfor constant food crop yield and constant food crop water consumption, combining agricultural statistical data,the China-AEZ model, and the GIS spatial analysis method, and estimated the impact of cultivated land change onfood crop production, food crop water consumption and food-water relations characterized by two major indicators,i.e., crop water productivity (CWP) and green water proportion (GWP), in China during 1990–2015. The resultsshowed that the increase of approximately 0.80% in cultivated land area in China resulted in a decrease of approx-imately 0.37% in average food crop yield per unit area, an increase of approximately 1.97% in blue water consump-tion per unit area (ETblue), and continuous decreases in both total water consumption per unit area (ETa) and greenwater consumption per unit area (ETgreen), with overall rates of 2.41% and 3.11%, respectively, at the national scalefrom 1990 to 2015. Concurrently, the average CWP continuously increased with an overall rate of 2.06%, while theaverage GWP continuously decreased with an overall rate of 0.86% at the national scale. A low-level coupling trendof food-water relations was concluded, together with a negative environmental effect. The food-water relationswere getting even worse in major cultivated land expansion areas and during the later period of 2000–2015. Theﬁndings of this study can be useful for providing a deep understanding of food-water relations corresponding to cul-tivated land change and giving suggestions for the sustainable development of cultivated land and the integratedmanagement of water resources.© 2020 Elsevier B.V.

IntroductionCultivated land is widely known as the basis of food production. Toprovide more food, the global area of cultivated land has been increasedby 12% over the last 50 years (Food and Agriculture Organization of theUnited Nations (FAO), 2011). The newly added cultivated land is mainlyderived from areas with forest, shrub, grassland and sparse vegetation(Lambin and Meyfroidt, 2011; Tan and Li, 2019). Moreover, cultivatedland has been converted into other land use types, i.e., forest, settlementand grassland, mainly attributed to land abandonment, urban expan-sion and environmental policy (Lambin and Meyfroidt, 2011; van Vlietet al., 2015; Li and Li, 2016; Tan and Li, 2019). The spatiotemporalchange of cultivated land has become one of the major manifestationsof global land use change, which can exert impacts on not only food pro-duction but also the associated water consumption and the relations be-tween them (Ewert et al., 2005; Foley et al., 2005; Foley et al., 2011; Zuoet al., 2018).China is a typical country experiencing spatiotemporal changes ofcultivated land. With the rapid development of industrialization and ur-banization in China, cultivated land has been lost, and the area of high-quality cultivated land occupied by built-up areas totaled approxi-mately 300 × 104 ha from 1996 to 2009 (Kong, 2014). This ﬁrst occurredin the more developing East China and then expanded to the less devel-oping Central and West China (Liu et al., 2014b). The decrease in thequantity of cultivated land has aroused much attention across China,and the government has implemented a set of programs aiming tomaintain the cultivated land requisition-compensation balance (Songand Pijanowski, 2014). However, the quality of the land converted toand from cultivated land usually varies, and therefore, the cultivatedland productivity at the national scale has changed along with the quan-tity of cultivated land, which may impact China's and even the world'ssecure supply of food. In this context, the quantiﬁcation of the impactof cultivated land change on food production has become the researchinterest of many scholars, whose evaluation methods and/or study pe-riods vary with each other, resulting in inconsistent conclusions (Yanet al., 2009; Liu et al., 2014c; Song and Liu, 2016; Xu et al., 2017; Liet al., 2018).In addition to food crop production, China's cultivated land changecan also exert an impact on food crop water consumption because thecrops or cropping systems adopted on cultivated land and their waterconsumption vary across the country (Liu et al., 2007b, 2009a). Morespeciﬁcally, the consumed water of food crops has different composi-tion with regard to water sources across China (Liu and Yang, 2010).Green water and blue water are generally used for food crop produc-tion; the former refers to the precipitation directly consumed by plantsto produce biomass (Rockström et al., 2007), which is more plentiful inSoutheast China than in Northwest China, while the latter is from sur-face water bodies and groundwater, which is a supplement to greenwater through irrigation (Hoekstra and Mekonnen, 2012). Blue waterplays a vital role in crop production and increasing crop yields, espe-cially for crops in Northern China (Liu et al., 2007a). In this context,the spatiotemporal change of cultivated land can exert impacts on “col-orful” water uses associated with food production. In other words, cul-tivated land change can bring about changes in not only blue waterconsumption but also green water consumption for food production.However, there was a very small number of studies paying attentionto changes of blue water consumption caused by cultivated land changein China, and the quantiﬁcation of changes in green water consumptionwas even marginalized by such studies(Huang et al., 2012; Zuo et al.,2018), mainly because the opportunity cost of blue water is muchhigher than that of green water, and the overuse of blue water, espe-cially that drawn from underground, were more likely to cause disastersand environmental problems (Liu and Yang, 2010; Wang et al., 2015).Considering that both green and blue water are important for food pro-duction, water use assessments are incomplete without consideringgreen water (Liu et al., 2009a).Besides food production and the associated water consumption, re-lations between them, i.e., food-water relations, may also change dueto the spatiotemporal change of cultivated land in China. Deﬁned asthe ratio of crop yield and water consumption, crop water productivity(CWP) combines the two important and interrelated processes in foodcrop production systems and is therefore regarded as an integrated in-dicator relating to food-water relations (Liu et al., 2007a; Lu et al.,2016). Previous studies focused mainly on the impacts of different irri-gation regimes on the CWP, using site experiments or crop models, withthe aim to give suggestions for the improvement of CWP with less irri-gation at local or regional scales (Li and Ren, 2019; Zhang et al., 2019b;Zhou and Zhao, 2019). (Liu et al., 2007a; Huang et al., 2019). There werealso studies relating to the modelling of CWP for speciﬁc food crops,e.g., wheat, at national scale, using large-scale food production models(Liu et al., 2007a; Huang et al., 2019). However, few studies consideredthe quantitative evaluation of changes in CWP for general food produc-tion from the perspective of the spatiotemporal changes of cultivatedland at the national and subnational scales in China. In addition, as theCWP does not take into account the structure of colorful water uses,the green water proportion of consumptive water use (GWP), whichis an effective tool to assess both the role of green water in food cropproduction and the impacts of colorful water uses on the environment,should also be evaluated to better characterize the food-water relationsin China (Liu et al., 2009a; Page et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2015; Lu et al.,2016). However, few studies have explored the methodology for suchquantiﬁcations.Considering the above shortcomings, in this study, we developed anew integrated approach to assess the impacts of spatiotemporalchange of cultivated land on food production and water consumptionand the relations between them in China. The main objectives of thisstudy were to (1) analyze the impact of the spatiotemporal change ofcultivated land on food production and colorful water consumptionsat the national and subnational scales in China during 1990–2015 and(2) specify the changes in food-water relations characterized mainlyby the CWP and GWP in China. Combining agricultural statistical data,the China-AEZ (Chinese edition of Agro-Ecological Zones) model, andgeographical information system (GIS), a new spatially explicit foodcrop yield dataset and a new spatially explicit food crop water con-sumption dataset of China were developed. The impacts of cultivatedland change on food crop production, food crop water consumption,CWP and GWP during 1990–2015 were quantiﬁed. This study addressesthe food-water nexus relating to land use change and has global signif-icance. The main ﬁndings of this study are meaningful not only formeeting the demands for the sustainable development of cultivatedland and integrated management of water resources in China but alsofor providing a reference for future studies in similar areas worldwideon the food-water effects of the spatiotemporal change of cultivatedland.2. Materials and methods2.1. A general theory framework for the impact of cultivated land change onfood-water relationsIn this study, we focused on the impact of cultivated land change onfood production and water consumption and the relations betweenthem by ignoring the temporal variations of climate and agriculturalpractices on cultivated land throughout China. Therefore, newspatially-explicit datasets for constant actual food crop yield, colorfulfood crop water consumptions, CWP and GWP were constructed forquantiﬁcation of these impacts. In this context, the spatial heterogene-ities of the above datasets can be regarded as the fundamental reasonsfor the generation of the impacts of cultivated land change in China.When spatiotemporal changes of cultivated land happened, values offood crop yield, colorful water consumptions, and the two major indica-tors representing food-water relations, i.e., CWP and GWP, in areas2X. Wang et al. / Science of the Total Environment 716 (2020) 137119experiencing expansion of cultivated land are very likely different withthose in areas suffering shrinkage of cultivated land within regions. Be-sides, the direction and magnitude of the changes can also be affected bythe areas of cultivated land increased and decreased within regions.Therefore, the spatiotemporal changes of cultivated land should haveresulted in changes of not only food crop production and colorfulwater consumptions but also the relations between them at the nationaland sub-national scales of China.In theory, changes of food-water relations can be roughly catego-rized into four trends: (1) When both CWP and GWP increase, thewater productivity improves together with a larger contribution ofgreen water in total water consumption. Considering the low opportu-nity cost of green water and the low negative environmental inﬂuencesof green water use, the food-water relation presents a signiﬁcant “high-level coupling” trend. (2) When CWP increases but GWP decreases, theimprovement of water productivity is accompanied by decline of thecontribution of green water in total water consumption. Therefore, al-though the food-water relation presents a coupling trend, this trend isnot perfect because higher burden is exerted on the environment bymore dependency on blue water. We deﬁne it as the “low-level cou-pling” trend. (3) When CWP and GWP both decrease, water productiv-ity decreases together with higher dependency on blue water for foodproduction, which is also more likely to trigger environmental prob-lems. Therefore, the food-water relation takes on a “high-leveldecoupling” trend. (4) When CWP decreases but GWP increases, the sit-uation is not so bad as that described above, and is deﬁned as the “low-level decoupling” trend.2.2. Data preparationThe spatial and temporal resolution of the datasets used in this studyare listed in Table 1.The land use data were obtained from the National Earth System Sci-ence Data Sharing Infrastructure (Chinese Academy of Sciences, 2019),with a resolution of 30 arc sec. They were updated regularly at ﬁve-year intervals from 1990 to 2015 with standard procedures based onLandsat TM/ETM+ images (Liu et al., 2014a). The land use data can begrouped into six major classes: cultivated land, woodland, grassland,water body, built-up area and unused land. The cultivated land mapsfor the years 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2015 were derived from the abovenational land-use database, which were not only used to identify thespatiotemporal change of cultivated land but also applied as major in-puts for the China-AEZ model.Meteorological data, including monthly maximum and minimumtemperature, precipitation, wind speed, relative humidity, and sunshineduration for the period 1981–2010, were obtained from the China Me-teorological Administration (2012). The 30-year average monthly datafor each of the above meteorological factors were ﬁrst calculated andthen interpolated to all of China using the thin plate smoothing splinemethod (Hancock and Hutchinson, 2006). These interpolated datawere also major inputs for the China-AEZ model.Soil data and the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data were alsomajor inputs for the China-AEZ model. Soil data, with a resolution of30 arc sec, were obtained from the Institute of Soil Science, ChineseAcademy of Sciences (IIASA/FAO, 2012). DEM data, with a resolutionof 3 arc sec, were obtained from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission(SRTM) database (CGIAR-CSI, 2006). The DEM data were resampled to30 arc sec before use in the China-AEZ model.Irrigated and rainfed crop areas, with a resolution of 5 arc minutes,were obtained from the global data set of monthly irrigated and rainfedcrop areas around the year 2000 (MIRCA 2000 data) (Portmann et al.,2010). However, crops grown on newly added cultivated land after2000 were not considered by these data. Therefore, using these dataand the spatial statistics tool in ArcGIS 10.4, we calculated the propor-tions of irrigated areas to total areas sown for major food crops at thecounty level, which were primary parameters for the quantiﬁcation offood crop water consumption across China. Using this method, we canﬁll up the missing data on newly added cultivated land, though the spa-tial resolution decreased. We assumed that the proportions for one cropremain the same within counties.The ratio of irrigated area to cultivated land area, with a resolution of30 arc sec, was obtained from the Chinese Academy of AgriculturalSciences (2016). It was applied when simulating the potential foodcrop yield, which was a primary parameter for the quantiﬁcation offood crop production in China.County-level agricultural statistical data, including the cultivatedland area, total production and sown area of food crops for the years1990, 2000, 2010, and 2015, were also obtained from the ChineseAcademy of Agricultural Sciences (2016). These data were used to cal-culate the multiyear average food crop yield and the multiyear averageproportions of areas sown with major food crops at the county level,which were key elements in developing the spatially explicit foodcrop yield dataset and the spatially explicit food crop water consump-tion dataset of China, respectively.The geographical boundaries used in this study included the bound-aries of the county and agricultural region, which were both derivedfrom the National Earth System Science Data Sharing Infrastructure(Chinese Academy of Sciences, 2019). The most recent county boundaryin 2014 was applied throughout the study, and all changes in countyboundaries during 1990–2015 were revised accordingly. A total of2340 counties were included, with Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao ex-cluded due to lack of data. A total of 9 agricultural regions were seg-mented based on agricultural production characteristics and physical-geographical environment (Fig. 1), aiming to characterize the spatialheterogeneity of changes in food-water relations relevant to the spatialshift of cultivated land within China.2.3. A brief description of the China-AEZ modelThe Chinese edition of the Agro-Ecological Zones (China-AEZ) modelwas applied in developing new spatially explicit datasets for constantfood crop yield and constant food crop water consumptions. Thismodel was developed during the major NSFC-IIASA cooperation pro-ject: Assessing the impact of climate change and incentive human activitieson China's agro-ecosystem and its supply potentials (2010−2012) (Tianet al., 2011; Tian et al., 2012). It can simulate crop growth and water bal-ance processes occurring throughout the soil-plant-atmosphere contin-uum, by taking into consideration of climate, soil, and terrain conditions.It can be used to obtain potential yield and water consumption, i.e., thetotal volume of water consumed in terms of evapotranspiration (ET), in-cluding green and blue water consumption/evapotranspiration (ETgreenand ETblue), of a variety of crops (Wang et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2019). Spe-ciﬁcally, the methodology for the calculation of potential yields is basedon ecophysiological principles, while ET is estimated using the cropTable 1Datasets used in this study.DatasetsSpatial referenceSource1.

Food crop yield dataset at the pixel levelThe spatially explicit constant food crop yield dataset of China, witha resolution of 30 arc sec, was developed using the statistical food cropyield at the county level, the potential yield estimated using theChina-AEZ model, and a GIS spatial analysis method.The food crop yield of county i was ﬁrst calculated using the follow-ing formulas:Yieldi ¼ 14X4m¼1P5k¼1 pimkP5k¼1 simk MCIim !ð1ÞMCIim ¼P simnsculð2Þwhere Yieldi is the average food crop yield per unit area (kg/ha) of4 years (1990, 2000, 2010, and 2015) for county i. The subscript m isthe code for the years, and m = 1, 2, 3, and 4. The multiyear averagefood crop yield is used to reduce ﬂuctuations of climate variation be-tween years. P5k¼1 pimk and P5k¼1 simk are the sums of productions andsown areas of major food crops of county i in year m, respectively. Thesubscript k refers to the food crop type. In this study, wheat, maize,rice, soybean, and potato were selected as major food crops in China be-cause they represent more than 90% of China's total food output (Liuet al., 2014b). Therefore, k = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. According to theNational Bureau of Statistics of the People's Republic of China (2016),potato production should be ﬁrst converted at a scale of 5:1 before itis added to the total production. The multiple cropping index (MCI)was applied to convert the average yield of food crops to the totalyield of food crops per unit area of cultivated land. MCIi equals theratio of the total area of agricultural crops sown (including food cropsand other cash crops) (∑simn) to the area of cultivated land (scul) incounty i.The food crop yield at the pixel level was then estimated, combinedwith the potential yield of food crops per unit area simulated by theChina-AEZ model and the GIS spatial analysis method. The formula ispresented below:Yieldij ¼ PYijPYi Yieldið3Þwhere Yieldij refers to the average food crop yield per unit area (kg/ha)of pixel j in county i. PYij refers to the potential yield of food crops ofpixel j in county i, and PYi refers to the average potential yield of foodcrops of county I, obtained using the GIS spatial analysis method. Thesimulated potential yield of food crops was previously used to assessthe impact of cultivated land change on food crop production potentialin China (Liu et al., 2014c; Xu et al., 2017). Although the simulated po-tential yield per unit area was nearly 1.55 times as much as the actualyield (the statistical one), an excellent correlation was found betweenthe simulated potential yield and the actual yield at the county level,taking the year 2010 as an example (Liu et al., 2014b). The spatial het-erogeneity of simulated potential yield can be a good reﬂection of thespatial variation of actual yield. Therefore, the potential yield of foodcrops per unit area was applied, and a new spatially explicit constantfood crop yield dataset of China was developed accordingly (Fig. 2a).When simulating potential food crop yield per unit area, the same pro-cedure as Liu et al. (2014c) was adopted in this study.2.5. Food crop water consumption dataset at the pixel levelA spatially explicit constant food crop water consumption dataset forChina, including not only total water consumption (ETa) but also ETgreenand ETblue for food crops on cultivated land in China, with a resolution ofFig. 1. Map of agricultural regions: HHH, SWR, YRR, SER, GXR, LPR, TPR, NER, and IMR represent the Huang-Huai-Hai region, the Southwest China region, the Middle-lower Yangtze Riverregion, the Southeast China region, the Gansu-Xinjiang region, the Loess Plateau region, the Tibetan Plateau region, the Northeast China region, and the Inner Mongolia region, respectively.4X.

ETa, ijk, ETgreen, ijk and ETblue, ijk refer to the totalwater consumption, green water consumption and blue water con-sumption of food crop k (mm) in pixel j of county i, respectively. Theyare calculated using the following formulas:ETa;ijk ¼ ETirra;ijk  IRRik þ ETrfda;ijk  1−IRRikðÞð8ÞETgreen;ijk ¼ ETirrgreen;ijk  IRRik þ ETrfdgreen;ijk  1−IRRikðÞð9ÞETblue;ijk ¼ ETirrblue;ijk  IRRikð10ÞwhereIRRikrefers to the proportion of irrigated area to the total area of foodcrop k sown in county i, which is calculated using the MIRCA 2000data. Here, we assumed that IRRik is homogeneous at the countylevel for the same food crop. ETa, ijkirr, ETgreen, ijkirrand ETblue, ijkirrrefer to thetotalwaterconsumption,greenwaterconsumptionandbluewaterconsumptionoffoodcropk(mm)inpixelj of county i under the irrigation condition, respectively; ETa, ijkrfdandETgreen, ijkrfdrefer to the total water consumption and green water con-sumption of food crop k (mm) in pixel j of county i under the rainfedcondition, respectively.The ET indicators of the 5 major food crops were separately esti-mated using the China-AEZ model. Details of the China-AEZ modellingmethodology for crop evapotranspiration can be found in one of ourprevious studies, taking winter wheat in the North China Plain as an ex-ample (Wang et al., 2015). In this study, we apply the ET values underthe average climatic conditions during 1981–2010 to offset the inﬂu-ence of extreme weather incidents. The results of the China-AEZmodel have been validated (Supplementary Fig. 1).Finally, we obtained constant food crop ETa, ETgreen and ETblue on cul-tivated land at the pixel level in China (Fig. 2b-d).2.6. Crop water productivity and green water proportionThe CWP at the pixel level can be calculated as the ratio of food cropyield to total water consumption:CWPij ¼ 10  Yieldij=ETa;ijð11Þwhere CWPij refers to the food crop water productivity (kg/m3) of pixel jin county i. Yieldij and ETa, ij refer to the food crop yield (kg/ha) and totalwater consumption (mm) of pixel j in county i, respectively. The con-stant 10 is used to convert mm into m3/ha.The GWP at the pixel level can be calculated as follows:GWPij ¼ ETgreen;ij=ETa;ij  100%ð12Þwhere GWPij refers to the green water proportion (%) for food crops inpixel j of county i. ETgreen, ij and ETa, ij refer to the green water consump-tion (mm) and total water consumption (mm) for food crops in pixel jof county i, respectively.A higher CWP indicates a higher water use efﬁciency in food cropproduction on cultivated land, while a smaller CWP means that morewater resources are consumed when achieving the same food cropyield. In terms of GWP, a higher value indicates a larger proportion ofETgreen to ETa in food crop production on cultivated land and corre-spondingly a more friendly environmental effect because the use ofgreen water instead of blue water places less pressure on the localwater supply system, and vice versa. The spatial distributions of CWPand GWP are shown in Fig. 2e-f.3. Results3.1. Spatiotemporal change of cultivated land in ChinaThe total area of cultivated land increased from approximately177.18 × 104 km2 in 1990 to 178.60 × 104 km2 in 2015, with an increas-ing rate of 0.80%. There was a larger amount of cultivated land incre-ment during 1990–2000, resulting in a larger area of cultivated land in2000 (180.05 × 104 km2) than in 2015, and a continuous decrease incultivated land area occurred during 2000–2015. Spatially, during1990–2000, the new cultivated land was mainly located in NortheastChina, while the decrease in cultivated land mainly occurred in the east-ern coastal area of China, especially the mostly developed Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, Yangtze River Delta region, and Pearl River Deltaregion (Fig. 3). During 2000–2010 and 2010–2015, the spatial distribu-tions of the changing area of cultivated land were nearly the same(Fig. 3): large-scale new cultivated land was located in NorthwestChina, followed by Northeast China; decrements continued in the east-ern coastal area of China, and they occurred in large amounts in the cen-tral and western areas of China, implying a spread of cultivated land lossfrom the eastern coastal area to the central and western areas in China.In terms of agricultural regions, their changing trends in cultivatedland area varied (Fig. 4). The YRR, the HHH, the SWR and the SER all suf-fered continuous decreases during 1990–2015. In comparison, the areasof cultivated land in the NER and the GXR continued to increase during1990–2015. Speciﬁcally, during 1990–2000, the increment in the NERwas 2.86 × 104 km2, much larger than the increment in the GXR(0.34 × 104 km2); in contrast, during 2000–2015, the increments inthe GXR added up to 1.94 × 104 km2, much larger than the incrementsin the NER (0.34 × 104 km2). The other three agricultural regions,i.e., the IMR, the LPR, and the TPR, increased in terms of the area of cul-tivated land during 1990–2000 and then decreased during 2000–2015,resulting in net increases in the IMR and the TPR and a net decrease inthe LPR during 1990–2015.3.2. Changes in food crop production and food crop water consumptionDuring 1990–2015, the spatial change of cultivated land resulted in a0.37% decrease in the average food crop yield at the national scale. Thiswas mainly attributed to the decreases of average food crop yield in theGXR and the NER, while the average food crop yield in the other agricul-tural regions all experienced increments during 1990–2015 (Fig. 5a).The changing trends were not consistent within the entire study period.With respect to the period 1990–2000, there was a 0.72% increase in av-erage food crop yield at the national scale, and most of the agriculturalregions, except the NER, experienced increments in average food cropyield. Then, the average food crop yield at the national scale began to de-crease, and the rates equaled 0.51% and 0.57% during 2000–2010 and2010–2015, respectively. Speciﬁcally, the average food crop yields inthe eastern regions, including the HHH, the YRR, the SER and the NER,together with the GXR, all changed to decrease during 2000–2010 andcontinued decreasing during 2010–2015, while those in the SWR, theLPR, and the TPR did not decrease until the period 2010–2015. Onlythe average food crop yield in the IMR continued to increase during1990–2015 (Fig. 5a).With the spatiotemporal change of cultivated land, both the averageETa and the average ETgreen of food crops in China continued decreasingduring 1990–2015, with overall rates of 2.41% and 3.11%, respectively.With respect to agricultural regions, the average ETa and the averageETgreen in the SER, the LPR, the TPR, and the NER all showed general de-creasing trends during 1990–2015. In comparison, approximate in-creases both in the average ETa and the average ETgreen occurred in theYRR, the HHH, the SWR, and the IMR. In the GXR, the changing trends6X. Wang et al. / Science of the Total Environment 716 (2020) 137119in the average ETa and the average ETgreen were the opposite, with theformer being positive and the latter being negative (Fig. 5b and c).The average ETblue of food crops ﬁrst decreased 0.53% during1990–2000 and then increased during 2000–2015, resulting in a total1.97% increase at the national scale during 1990–2015. During1990–2000, decreases of the average ETblue occurred in most of the ag-ricultural regions, except the YRR and the GXR, and the decreasing ratein the NER was the greatest (2.50%). Then, the changing trends in theIMR increased during 2000–2015, while the changing trends in theother agricultural regions remained the same as those during\", 'unique_identifier': 248}\n",

As a response, its government is incorporating new patterns of land use and developing regional water infrastructure to cope with the related challenges. In this study, we assess to what point these efforts contribute to integrated water and food security in the country. We investigated the period 2004-2013 in the most productive agricultural region - the Guayas river basin district (GRBD) - and analysed the impacts of different scenarios of agricultural change on local water security. Our approach integrates MuSIASEM (Multi-Scale Integrated Analysis of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism) with the hydrological SWAT model. Freshwater allocation is evaluated within all the water cycle from its source (natural systems) to the final users (societal systems). Water security is assessed spatiotemporally in terms of water stress for the population living in poverty. Water productivity is obtained in relation to agricultural production and nutrition. The multi-scale analysis shows that whereas at national level the median annual streamflow has a similar magnitude than rainfall stored in soil, these two parameters differ spatiotemporally at subbasin level. The study finds the greatest challenges in achieving water security is the south-east and central part of the GRBD, due to water scarcity and a larger population living in poverty. However, these areas are also simultaneously, where the greatest crop water productivity is found. We conclude that food production for both domestic consumption and market-oriented exports can be increased while meeting ecosystem water demands in all the GRBD regions except for the east. Our integration of methods provide a better approach to inform integrated land and water management and is relevant for academics, practitioners and policymakers alike.

Introduction  4 Ecuador faces an important food security challenge, where approximately two million 5 people - 11% of its population - are undernourished (FAO, 2017). In response, the 6 government has implemented a legal reform that enshrines food sovereignty in its 7 Constitution (República del Ecuador, 2008) following the principles of the National 8 [Development] Plan for Good Living1 –NPGL– (SENPLADES, 2013). The NPGL 9 principles were incorporated into the Food Sovereignty Regime Organic Law of 2009, 10 which sought to avoid further monocultures and provides support for local farmers in the 11 country. It has resulted in a raise of public investment in agriculture from $93 million to 12 $268 million in the period 2003-2009 (Nehring, 2012). Despite legal efforts, public 13 investment has not achieved local food security. On the contrary, it resulted in an increase 14 in food production for export – a similar trend to other Latin American countries (Falconí et 15 al., 2017).  16 The country has a large water endowment (average runoff of 1,275 mm), but it also 17 presents an unequal distribution of water throughout regions and dry-wet seasons 18 (CISPDR, 2014). A number of studies assess the physical and social drivers of Ecuador’s 19 water allocation within the water cycle. These include the effects of land use change 20 (Espinosa and Rivera, 2016) and climate change (Molina et al., 2015) over freshwater 21 provision or the contribution of paramo and aquifers retention capacity to baseflow 22 (Guzmán et al., 2015). Research has also addressed the role of water user organisations in 23 water management (Hoogesteger, 2013) and how institutional reforms strengthen water 24 rights (Cremers et al., 2005) of local irrigation communities. Those studies focus mainly on 25 small (i.e., <500 km2) highland catchments from the Andean region, but to date and to the 26                                                            1 The National Plan for Good Living (Plan del Buen Vivir) comes out at four-year intervals (2009–2013 followed by 2013-2017). It is based on the indigenous Quechua concept of Sumak Kawsay (Buen Vivir) - a social paradigm - with objectives to ‘better the quality of life of the population, develop their capacities and potential’.  MANUSCRIPTACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT2  best of our knowledge there are no detailed spatiotemporal assessments of Ecuador that 27 cover the distribution of available water resources, land use distribution (including irrigated 28 areas) and their assigned water demand. More importantly, there are no studies on the areas 29 with larger population densities of people living in poverty and where the most valuable 30 crops are produced. 31 Distribution of available water resources will also likely be affected by future political 32 decisions, related to changes in agricultural land patterns and water infrastructure, to ensure 33 local and global food demand. The National Hydraulic Plan (period 2014-2035) and the 34 National Plan for Irrigation and Drainage foresee an increase of the irrigated area by 53% 35 (from 941,000 to 1,443,000 ha) (MAGAP, 2013) and the existing reservoir volume by 90% 36 (from 7,690 hm3 to 14,672 hm3) (CISPDR, 2014), showing a strong connection between 37 food and water security. Thus, for successful implementation over time, both agricultural 38 development and water resource management must be coherent. 39 Integrated Land and Water Resources Management (ILWRM) is a scientific approach that 40 highlights the connections between land and water management with the purpose of 41 strengthen their interaction (Falkenmark et al., 2014). ILWRM builds on Integrated Water 42 Management principles, but it provides a further step to environmental evaluations due to 43 the considerations of water-land interactions at the local level (ibid). Indeed, local issues 44 are more tractable because  the systems co-exist in space (de Loë and Patterson, 2017). 45 Despite the scientific consensus on the usefulness of the approach, ILWRM has had limited 46 practical applications by water practitioners and lacks explicit consideration on 47 environmental policies and development plans. For example, in Europe, the Water 48 Framework Directive does not mention the relevance and effects of land use changes and 49 practices on available water resources, which has resulted in a disconnection between 50 agricultural and water policy objectives (Cabello and Madrid, 2014). Moreover, certain 51 agricultural policy measures also determine land use management practices with effects on 52 water allocation (Salmoral et al., 2017). This has also been the case in Ecuador, where 53 national development plans, aim to increase food provision by including additional irrigated 54 areas and changing crop patterns distributions, but there is no evaluation on the 55 implications of such decisions on local water resources.  56  MANUSCRIPTACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT3  We focus on the Guayas river basin district (GRBD), as it is central to Ecuadorian water 57 and food security.  The study aims to answer the following questions: 1) What are the water 58 needs for food security in the GRBD? 2) How does food security and the related 59 agricultural development affect water security? The paper is organized as follows. Section 60 2 describes the selected case study and the ILWRM method, which combines MuSIASEM 61 (Multi-Scale Integrated Analysis of Societal and Ecosystem Metabolism) (Giampietro et 62 al., 2009) and the hydrological model SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) (Arnold et 63 al., 1998). The applied indicators for food and water security links and water productivities 64 are described and scenarios towards water and food security aims presented. Section 3 65 shows the main results, also including an evaluation of water and food security changes 66 under the proposed scenarios. Section 4 discusses the relevance of our method and obtained 67 multi-level results, and highlights the pressures on local water resources as well as the 68 related implications of national development strategies for water and food security.  69 2. Materials and methods  70 2.1. The Guayas river basin district  71 The Guayas river basin district (GRBD) has a land area of 44,532 km2 (i.e., 16% of the 72 country surface) and provides water resources for about 6 million inhabitants (i.e., 40% of 73 the national population (INEC, 2015)). In 2010, the GRBD contained 380,840 ha irrigated 74 land, which holds 57% of the national agricultural irrigated area (CISPDR, 2014; CISPDR, 75 2015). The GRBD is a humid tropical system comprising a rainy season from December to 76 May and a wet one for the remaining months. There are precipitation variations from the 77 north (2,900-3,100 mm) to the south (300-700 mm) (CISPDR, 2015).  The GRBD contains 78 the largest share of the national agricultural area for the region’s most significant crops i.e., 79 rice (96%), banana (68%), sugar cane (97%), corn (55%) , coffee (33%) and palm oil  80 (19%)  (MAGAP, 2015) (Fig. 1; Table A1).  81  MANUSCRIPTACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT4   82 Fig. 1.

Studying the water metabolism within ILWRM 86 ILWRM analyses face an important ‘issue of scale’ (Cumming et al., 2006) because joint 87 water-land analyses require the simultaneous adoption of different spatial-temporal scales. 88 These differences are marked by water and land dynamics, with differing cycles and 89 geographical boundaries. To address these factors this study assesses the water metabolism 90 of socio-ecological systems from an ILWRM perspective using MuSIASEM (Giampietro et 91 al., 2009).  92 MuSIASEM is a very powerful framework for the analysis of water use and its resulting 93 impacts (Madrid-López et al., 2014; Madrid et al., 2013; Serrano-Tovar et al., 2014). 94 However, it needs to be adapted to soil and land use dynamics for its application to 95 ILWRM. Fig. 2 shows a chart that summarizes the adaptation and how the water 96 metabolism of socio-ecosystems is conceptualized. The upper part connects the flows of 97 water that reach the land surface and are available at the ecosystem level with those water 98 flows used for food production. The lower level shows the structural organization of each 99 system and the factors that transform them: climate change, ecosystem water requirements 100 and food provision. Policy making is an important part of the metabolism, as it guides the 101 biophysical flows that and has a direct influence over water and food security.

MuSIASEM-SWAT integration 109 In this study, MuSIASEM serves as a framework in which (1971) Georgescu-Roegen’s  110 ‘flow’ and ‘fund’ concepts are used to structure the analysis. Funds refer to the components 111 of the socio-ecosystems, which must be maintained (trees, people, river patterns, etc.) In 112 general terms, a specific analytical tool is chosen according to the type of flow to be 113 studied. The results of this analysis are contextualized with a study of the fund elements. As 114 this study focuses on a river basin district, we use the hydrological model SWAT (Arnold 115 et al., 1998). SWAT is able to simulate ecosystem water funds and societal water flows and 116 integrate different spatiotemporal levels of water-land links. The model presents the 117 capacity to combine hydrological components with a plant growth module, which is 118 essential for the assessment of agricultural production in our study. However, it fails to tell 119 the story behind those flows, thus the fund description of MuSIASEM is used for their 120 contextualization. 121  MANUSCRIPTACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT6  We use SWAT parameters as proxies for the estimation of five different water metabolism 122 semantic categories2, as presented in Madrid-Lopez and Giampietro (2014) (Table 1):  123 • Ecosystem water funds refer to the natural runoff (Rnat) and soil water storage 124 (SWSecosystems) patterns. Rnat and SWSecosystems are calculated following Salmoral et al. 125 (2017).  126 • Ecosystem water flows refers to the water demand from terrestrial and aquatic 127 ecosystems for their proper functioning.  128 • Societal available water (SAW) is the amount of water that can be used by society 129 taking into account constraints of ecosystem water demands and available 130 infrastructure.  131 • Gross water appropriation (GWA) includes the consumptive (i.e., evaporation, 132 transpiration, integration into a product, or release into a different drainage basin or 133 the sea) and non-consumptive (i.e., water used for cooling or polluted water) water 134 used for human activities.  135 • Net water use (NWU) considers only consumptive water that has actually been used 136 (excluding losses). 137 We perform a monthly step analysis during the period 2004-2013 for each subbasin 138 generated by SWAT. The outputs are later summarized by the total river basin district and 139 at yearly steps. The detailed information required to run SWAT, design the model and 140 evaluate its performance is included in the Supplemental Material.  141  142 Table 1.

Evaluating food and water security links and water productivities  148 The evaluation of food and water security has been assessed with three different 149 approaches3: 150 • Water security can be framed focusing on quantity and availability of water 151 (Rodrigues et al., 2014), which in the end is also related to food security to meet 152 agricultural needs (Cook and Bakker, 2012).  Blue flow/fund shows the water stress 153                                                            3 See Supplementary Material for more details regarding methods and data used.

In contrast, NWUgreen and SWS only refer per 165 subbasin.  166 • Blue water security is also evaluated with a weighted population under poverty by 167 the volume of unavailable water per unit of drainage area (Poverty water unsecure 168 s,m, in inhabitants m3/m2), when net blue water use exceeds societal available water: 169  170  ! \"  #$, = %\" &\\'()*+,- × ( 012345*  − 781345* )\"&\" \"\" if NWUblue > SAWblue 171  [3] 172 Where,  population poverty: population under poverty for each drainage area; 173 drainage area: sum of the total upstream subbasin area for each 174 under study (m2) 175 In the GRBD a total 3,681,472 inhabitants are considered to be living in poverty 176 (INEC, 2011; CISPDR, 2015).  177 • Crop water productivity (CWP in kg/m3) and crop water nutrition (CWN, kcal/L) 178 assess the level of food production in relation to water consumption, including both 179  MANUSCRIPTACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT9  blue and green water. These are calculated at subbasin level and annual resolution in 180 dry matter content for croplands and pasture. Crops production is first converted 181 into the main food product applying extraction coefficients and later to kcal.  182  183  184 2.5. Scenarios towards water and food security aims 185 Four scenarios evaluate the implications on local water resources and food provision by 186 2035 due to changes on water infrastructure and agricultural land uses (Table A6)4. 187 “Irrigation”: Development of new water infrastructure under current crop patterns 188 This scenario exclusively shows the planned expansion of irrigated areas (from 413,420 to 189 814,900 ha) and reservoir storage capacity (from 8,625 to 12,332 hm3) according to the 190 GRBD Hydraulic Plan. The crop distribution area is the same as in the baseline scenario 191 (Fig. 1).  192 In the following scenarios, the irrigated areas, storage capacity and water transfers are kept 193 the same as in Irrigation. The only condition that changes is crop distributions.  194 “Exports”: Crop pattern changes supporting international exports 195 Crop pattern changes are justified by the enthusiasm for international exports. Between 196 2013 and 2035 coffee, cocoa and palm oil areas are annually increased by 1% and the 197 reforested areas by 2%, according to the existing agricultural and reforestation programs. 198 To meet this expansion, pasture land and natural herbaceous vegetation are reduced by 199 170,283 and 2,090 ha, respectively. 200 “Sovereignty”: Crop pattern changes towards food sovereignty aims 201 This scenario promotes agricultural production and consumption within the country. Sugar 202 cane, soya and yellow corn are selected towards food sovereignty aims, since these are the 203 main products that Ecuador currently imports. They are increased with an annual growth 204 rate of 1.6%, 2.2% and 2.2%, respectively. To allow this crop pattern change, a total area of 205                                                            4 More details about data and methods applied are available in the Supplemental Material.   MANUSCRIPTACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT10  171,470 ha is reduced, including mainly pasture land, followed by natural herbaceous 206 vegetation, white corn and bush areas. 207 “Mix”: Promotion of both international exports and food sovereignty aims 208 The last scenario assesses the overall changes from Scenarios 2 and 3, supported by the 209 idea that a mix from previous scenarios might be the most plausible future option. 210 3. Results  211 3.1. The water metabolism of the GRBD 212 The annual median ecosystem blue water fund during the study period (31,793 hm3 - i.e., 213 714 mm) is slightly larger than the green water fund (30,553 hm3 – i.e., 686 mm). At 214 subbasin level both streamflow (between 90 and 1,960 mm) and soil water (between 60 to 215 1030 mm) funds differ spatially (Fig. A2). At the societal level, streamflow availability is 216 reduced to meet environmental flow requirements, but the presence of reservoirs provide an 217 additional median annual volume of 5,375 hm3. The agricultural character of the river basin 218 district is shown by the dominance of freshwater water flows for agricultural production. 219 Agricultural production allocates 75% and 64% of the blue and green net water use, 220 respectively. The GRBD is water self-sufficient in food trade because it exports in the 221 international market more virtual water (4,345 hm3) than it imports (1,064 hm3). However, 222 the exports depend on a greater extent to blue water, which comprises 30% of virtual water 223 exports, whereas blue virtual water imports only make up 10% (Fig. 3). 224  MANUSCRIPTACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT11   225 Fig. 3. Links between the water metabolism of ecosystems and society in the GRBD. Annual 226 median values in hm3 for the period 2004-2013.  227 The south-east of the basin is where the largest annual net blue water use (i.e., NWUblue) 228 occurs (> 200 mm). In those subbasins irrigation comprises more than 98% of the NWUblue, 229 except for subbasin 31 where 50% of the water consumption refers to urban demand to 230 supply Guayas city. Subbasins with the greatest NWUgreen (i.e., >800 mm) are located in the 231 centre and north (Fig. 4). The values of these green water flows are shaped by existing land 232 use distribution, and also by climatic conditions and capacity of soils to store water.  233  MANUSCRIPTACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT12   234 Fig. 4. Blue (left) and green (right) net water use (mm) by subbasin as annual median values for the 235 period 2004-2013. Pie charts show the proportion of main water users. 236  237 3.2. Water stress and population under poverty 238 At subbasin and monthly steps, some regions appear as blue water unsecure due to water 239 scarce conditions. NWUblue exceeds the available blue water for human purposes (i.e., 240 SAWblue) in the south east, central and upper parts (Fig. 5). Blue flow/fund takes values > 1 241 upstream Angas, Cañar, Macul dam and Quevedo monitoring stations. There are also cases 242 (i.e., Babahoyo, Chimbo and Macul dam stations) when even the monthly SAWblue shows 243 negative values (Fig. 5), which means that available streamflow and water stored in 244 reservoirs cannot cover the environmental flow requirements (Table A7). In contrast, Daule 245 Peripa and Vince reservoirs, located at the north-west and central part, allow water savings 246 during the wet period to maintain water demand downstream (i.e., Daule II and Vince 247 stations). 248 Green flow/fund has the smallest values (i.e., < 0.6) for all subbasins between February and 249 April, which coincides with the rainy season. October and November, is when green 250 flow/fund > 0.6 occurs mostly for subbasins located in the centre of the GRBD, whereas in 251  MANUSCRIPTACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT13  July, it occurs for subbasins located in the northwest (Fig. A4). This is probably explained 252 by different precipitation distribution in the study area. 253  254 Fig. 5. Median (p50) and 10th percentile (p10) of monthly societal available water (SAWblue) and net 255 blue water use (NWUblue) during the study period 2004-2013 for upstream drainage areas.  256 Poverty water unsecure (inhabitants m3/m2) weights the total population living in poverty 257 by the volume of unsecure blue water per drainage area. East GRBD is where most times 258 NWUblue exceeds the existing fund for human purposes (grey subbasins in Fig. 6). Poverty 259 water unsecure shows monthly median values larger than 1,000 inhabitants m3/m2 upstream 260 Babahoyo station, Chimbo station and subbasin 38 (Fig. 6). The population under poverty 261 and blue water stress differs greatly from year and month depending on the climatic years 262 (i.e., from zero to a maximum of 1,260,317 inhabitants) (Table A8). Median monthly 263 values of poverty water unsecure ranges from 2,057 (February) to 7,522 (September) 264 inhabitants m3/m2, considering all the affected areas. A total population of 1,200,996 265 inhabitants and 51% GRBD’s area is under monthly blue water stress (unsecure volume of 266 blue water from 39 to 142 hm3) (Table A9).   267  268  MANUSCRIPTACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT14   269 Fig. 6.

Food vs water security 273 In the GRBD, 28.9 x 10^13 kcal (including pastures) are produced as median annual values 274 for the study period, 31% allocated for crops for exports and the remaining for food 275 sovereignty crops. Regarding blue water, crops for exports account for 53% of the gross 276 water appropriation, whereas sovereignty crops allocate 47%. For green water, the 277 magnitude of sovereignty crops goes up to 72% of the total green water consumption 278 (Table 2).  279  MANUSCRIPTACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT15   280 Table 2.

High pasture yields generate high CWP in some subbasins 286 (e.g., subbasin 18). Larger CWP also takes place in subbasins with a dominant presence of 287 sugar cane and banana (e.g., subbasins 23 and 27). In contrast, subbasins within the Andean 288 region have the lowest CWP with values below 0.1 kg m-3 (Fig. 7a).  289 In terms of nutritional value, as expected, those subbasins with irrigation can produce larger 290 quantities of kcal too (i.e. greater CWN, in kcal/L). CWN shows a similar geographic 291 distribution as CWP. However, some differences are found due to the existing crops 292 patterns per subbasin and caloric content of the food product they provide (Fig. 7b). For 293 instance, subbasins 42 and 43 has a median of 0.45 and 0.34 kg m-3 CWP, respectively, but 294 the median CWN is 8.3 and 6.3 kcal/L. This is due to the existence of sugarcane in 10% of 295 each subbasin area, which shows both a high crop yield and caloric content (387 kcal/100 296 grams).   297  MANUSCRIPTACCEPTEDACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT16  Fig. 7. a) Crop water productivity (kg m-3) and b) crop water nutrition (kcal L-1) as median values 298 per subbasin for the period 2004-2013.

Water and food security changes under 2035 scenarios 301 In the proposed scenarios, annual median values of societal available blue water (SAWblue) 302 (i.e., natural runoff - environmental flow requirements + reservoir storage) decreased in 303 comparison to Baseline (from 17,940 in Baseline to 16,130 hm3 in Mix). Available 304 streamflow decreased from 12,565 in Baseline to 8,460 hm3 in Mix, but this decrease is 305 offset by providing water from reservoirs.  Gross (net) irrigation raises from 5,890 (2,895) 306 in Baseline to 10,165 hm3 (6,135) in Mix. In contrast, agricultural green water consumption 307 declines from 19,660 (Baseline) to 18,505 hm3 (Exports) (Table A10).  308 The scenarios show a decrease in NWUblue in relation to existing SAWblue, as additional 309 reservoirs can mitigate water stress that was occurring in some regions in Baseline. Blue 310 flow/fund is reduced from Baseline to proposed scenarios into values < 1 in Macul dam, 311 Chimbo, Babahoyo and Cañar (Fig. 8 for median values and Fig. A5 for 90th percentile). 312 Moreover, with the proposed scenarios, no negative SAWblue takes place as in baseline 313 scenario (Table A7), meaning that available streamflow and water stored', 'unique_identifier': 249}\n",

Impacts on existing activities for irrigation design and management systems are obvious due to the rapid change of climate system. This paper’s future focus is to evaluate the influence of the changing climate on the crop yield and irrigation requirement for the Wonji Shoa sugarcane plantation estate. For future climate data, it used the results of projections of the CORDEX regional climate model (RCM) with bias correction for medium concentration representative pathway 4.5 rcp and high concentration representative pathway 8.5 rcp scenario. The down-scaled data were then used as input to the AquaCrop model. The time series indicates a significant increasing trend in maximum and minimum temperature values and a slight increasing trend in precipitation for both 4.5 rcp and 8.5 rcp scenarios. The evapotranspiration shows an increase in 20.34%, 20.12%, 23.59%, and 24.36% for 8.5 rcp in the period of 2020s, 2040s, 2060s, and 2080s, respectively. For 4.5 rcp scenario, the change is about 8.4%, 11.65%, 13.22%, and 15.85% for the period of 2020s, 2040s, 2060s, and 2080s, respectively. The model output shows that there is an annual increase in yield. For 8.5 rcp scenarios, the incensement is 6.2%, 7.84, 11.03%, and 14.48% in the 2020s, 2040s, 2060s, and 2080s, respectively. For 4.5 rcp scenarios, the increment is much lower compared to 8.5 rcp scenarios. But there is still an increase in yield for 4.5 rcp. The change is 0.3%, 1.8%, 7.02%, and 4.82% for the period of 2020s, 2040s, 2060s, and 2080s, respectively.Similar content being viewed by othersClimate change and agriculture in South Asia: adaptation options in smallholder production systemsArticle Open access09 July 2019Climate change and variability in Kenya: a review of impacts on agriculture and food securityArticle 08 January 2020Climate-resilient strategies for sustainable management of water resources and agricultureArticle 07 June 2021Use our pre-submission checklistAvoid common mistakes on your manuscript.IntroductionThe global mean surface temperature changes for the period 2016–2035 relative to 1986–2005 will likely be in the range of 0.3 °C to 0.7 °C [1]. In Ethiopia, observations show a year-to-year variation for rainfall events all over the country [2]. While regional models predict an increase in rainfall, higher resolution analyses for Ethiopia suggest with spatial differences, there are both increases and decreases in the overall rainfall averages. The challenges faced by the agricultural sector under the climate change scenarios are to deliver food security for an increasing world population while protecting the environment and the functioning of its ecosystems. Climate change has become a significant threat to agriculture and food security across the globe. Projected changes in temperature, precipitation, and CO2 concentration are expected to significantly impact crop productivity [3]. Erratic temperature and precipitation conditions are shown to often occur concurrently, with dry growing seasons more likely to be hotter, have larger drought indices, and have larger vapor pressure deficits. This leads to the confluence of a variety of climate conditions that negatively impact crop yields [4].The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s [5] findings suggest that developing countries like Ethiopia will be more vulnerable to climate change due to their economic, climatic, and geographic settings. Climate change can affect multiple features of aquatic resources (e.g., quantity and quality, high and low flow extremes, timing of events, and water temperature). All these aspects affect livelihoods in the basin but have not received attention in planning for future water allocation and design of water infrastructures yet [6].Sugarcane (Saccharum spp. hybrids) is tropical grass broadly grown in both hemispheres in over 120 countries worldwide. It is an important agro-industrial cash crop, providing raw materials for different sugar industries, and plays a crucial role in the economy of several countries [7]. Ethiopia is among the countries which are struggling to cover their high demands for sugar all over the country and the world though we cannot cover even the country’s needs. Having the abovementioned and other related problems, it is imperative to understand the effect of upcoming climate variation on hydrometeorology and its subsequent influence on the lives of people and sugar products. This paper simulated the impacts of climate change on sugarcane in Wonji Shoa plantation using the AquaCrop model and a range of two projected downscaled climate scenarios, to estimate the likely future impacts on the crop in terms of yield and irrigation water requirement.MethodologyDescription of the Study AreaThe study area which is the Wonji Shoa sugar estate lies downstream of the Koka Dam in the Central Rift Valley of Ethiopia in the Awash River Basin (Fig. 1), 110 km southeast of Addis Ababa and 10 km south of Adama by road approximately between 8°21′ to 8°29′ N and 39°12′ to 39°18′ E (Fig. 2) [8]. The estate (including out-growers) has a total area of about 8000 ha (excluding the current under expansion), and the factory has a total crushing capacity of 3500 TCD (ton of cane). Approximately 9319 households (6184 male-headed and 3135 female-headed) participate in the out-grower scheme. Each household possesses between 0.2 and 6 ha of land [9], and the out-growers supply 60% of the total sugarcane crushed per year.Fig. 1Location map of the study areaFull size imageFig. 2Observed and bias-corrected RCM monthly mean (A) Tmax, (B) Tmin, and (C) precipitation for baseline periodFull size imageThe Wonji Shoa irrigation scheme is found at an altitude of approximately 1500 m above sea level (m.a.s.l.). In the estate, generally, the slope of the farm is very gentle and regular.It has a semi-arid climate and obtains an average annual rainfall of 831.2 mm, highest daily evapotranspiration of 4.5 mm, and mean annual maximum and minimum temperatures of 27.6 °C and 15.2 °C, respectively. The soil of WSSE is mainly Andosols, Fluvisols, Leptosols, and Phaeozemes, according to the FAO soil classification.The main forms of land cover used in the Wonji Shoa irrigated land is perennial crop cover dominated by sugar cane plantation and uses high amount of water from the Awash River during the dry season of the year.Data collocationSources and Types of DataTo meet the objectives of this research, different types of data were collected from both primary and secondary data sources including satellite imagery and field data. Data collected included spatial data, hydrological data, and meteorological data.Meteorological DataMeteorological data was required since it will used as input to the Aqua crop model in the baseline scenario. The future metrological records which are already downscaled are available in different climate portals and used with bias correction. Based on these objectives, the meteorological data required for this study were collected from the Wonji Shoa sugarcane estate research center weather station, Ethiopian National Meteorological Services Agency (NMSA) at Addis Ababa. The daily meteorological data collected were precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and sunshine hours.Crop, Irrigation, and Soil DataThe crop, irrigation, and soil data are used in the Aqua crop model for simulation of the system (Wonji Shoa plantation state). The soils of WSSE are of alluvial-colluvial origin established under hot, tropical environments. Texturally, the soil can be categorized into light (course textured) and heavy (clayey black) soils. The estate sidetracked irrigation water from Awash River using centrifugal pumps and then to the masonry-lined main canal. Field water application is through a block-ended furrow irrigation system, and the excess water from the plantation fields is worn out through the network of surface drains. The main crops cultivated are sugarcane, haricot bean, and crotalaria. Sugarcane is planted at a rate of 16–18 t/ha in the estate, and it is cultivated as a perennial mono crop [2].Method of Analysis and ProceduresInvestigation of climate change’s impact on irrigation consists of the following steps:1.Using coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment over the African domain (CORDEX-Africa) with coupled model inter-comparison project phase 5 (CMIP5) simulations under representative concentration pathways (under the effect of increasing greenhouse gases) for Wonji Shoa plantation estate compatible with AquaCrop model and2.Use of AquaCrop model to simulate the effects of climate change on small-scale irrigation.Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX)Coupled Atmosphere–Ocean General Circulation Models (GCMs) are used for studying current and future climate globally, which simulate the climate of the Earth at the spatial determination of a few hundred kilometers. To detain the local impacts of topography and land surface features on climate and provide a better explanation of extreme events, limited-area regional climate models (RCMs) are used to downscale the GCM amount produced [10]. The Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) [10] is an initiative funded by the World Climate Research Program. The goal is to scheme a set of standardized research intended to scale back GCM predictions from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 (CMIP5) [5] in the widely held of the land areas of the world, both via RCMs and statistical techniques (dynamical and statistical downscaling, respectively).Future Climate Scenario DataThe climate scenario data used here are freely available data which is already downscaled and can be used directly by bias correcting for model output of Cordex of four scenarios, 2.5 rcp, 4.5 rcp, 6.5 rcp, and 8.5 rcp, produced by greenhouse gas, sulfate aerosol, and solar forcing and NCEP reanalysis data. The considered climate data are for medium and high (4.5 rcp and 8.5 rcp) scenarios of precipitation, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature.Bias Correction of the Row RCM DataClimate models often provide biased representations of observed time series, making correction procedures necessary [11]. Bias correction actions employ a transformation algorithm for correcting RCM output. The method used for bias correction of the study is the linear-scaling approach works with monthly correction values based on the changes between observed and present-day simulated values. Corrected RCM simulations will faultlessly agree in their monthly mean values with the observations. Precipitation is corrected with a factor based on the ratio of long-term monthly mean observed and control run data.$${p}_{cuntr}^{\\\\ast }(d)={P}_{cuntr}(d).\\\\left\\\\{\\\\left({p}_{obs}(d)\\\\right)/\\\\left({p}_{cuntr}(d)\\\\right)\\\\right\\\\}$$$${p}_{scen}^{\\\\ast }(d)={p}_{scen}(d).\\\\left\\\\{\\\\left({p}_{obs}(d)\\\\right)/\\\\left({p}_{cuntr}(d)\\\\right)\\\\right\\\\}$$$${T}_{cuntr}^{\\\\ast }(d)={T}_{cuntr}(d)+{\\\\mu}_m.\\\\left({T}_{obs}(d)\\\\right)-{\\\\mu}_m\\\\left({T}_{cuntr}(d)\\\\right)$$$${T}_{scen}^{\\\\ast }(d)={T}_{scen}(d)+{\\\\mu}_m.\\\\left({T}_{obs}(d)\\\\right)-{\\\\mu}_m\\\\left({T}_{cuntr}(d)\\\\right)$$where * is the final bias corrected, cuntr is the RCM simulated 1961–1990, μ is the monthly mean (location parameter of Gaussian distribution), and scen is the RCM-simulated 2005–2099.AquaCrop Model SimulationAquaCrop is the FAO crop model to simulate harvest reaction to water. It is intended to balance ease, accuracy, and robustness and is predominantly suited to address conditions where water is a key controlling element in crop production. The AquaCrop model requires inputs including climatic parameters, crop, soil, and field and irrigation management data. The model contains a complete set of input parameters that can be selected and adjusted for different soil or crop types. The system (the interaction between plant and soil) is also affected by management (field and irrigation) which is fertility, when and in what amount to apply irrigation water. The system links with the outside world which is an upper boundary. At the upper boundary, there are weather conditions which describe what is the rainfall, how much energy available to vaporize water, and what is the concentration of carbon dioxide. At the lower boundary, the ground water table is linked to the system in which water commences the system drain and the water table near the soil and subsoil and then water moves by capillary rise from the water table to the subsoil.Conditions in Upper BoundaryThe upper boundary is about the weather condition, and it consists of reference evapotranspiration, rainfall, minimum and maximum temperature, and annual CO2 concentration. Metrological data recorded in Wonji Shoa station is used to compute reference evapotranspiration (ETo), and it expresses the evaporating power of the atmosphere. It determines the rate of transpiration and evaporation in AquaCrop which can be calculated from metrological data. Next to ETo, AquaCrop requires minimum and maximum temperatures, and it is required to calculate growing degree days which determine the speed of crop development. For ETo, minimum and maximum temperatures can be entered daily, 10 daily, or monthly. However, AquaCrop will need to work and simulate in daily time steps. In the Wonji Shoa case, both baseline and future data (ETo, minimum and maximum temperatures, and rainfall) are in daily steps. AquaCrop also requires rainfall data to update daily water balance and to simulate water stress. Finally, AquaCrop needs mean annual CO2 concentration because it affects biomass-making and crop transpiration. It consists of recorded and projected (future) concentrations. The latter one is used for climate alteration scenarios.Climate FileAquaCrop contains a database in which climatic data is stored. On the one hand, we have the evaporating power of the atmosphere which is stored on the ETo file. We also have a Tnx file which contains minimum and maximum air temperatures. Next, we have Flu files which contain rainfall, and finally, we have CO2 file which contains long record mean annual CO2 concentration. These four files contain climatic data. Finally, there is a climate file which is a Cli file, and it does not contain any data but tells which is the Eto, Tnx, Plu, and CO2 files that are linked to that particular station. By means of CO2 files (estimated from the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC)), it enables testing the crop response under climate change scenarios. From dew point temperature, air humidity is usually obtained.Solar radiation (Rs) can be anticipated from difference between maximum temperature (Tmax) and minimum temperature (Tmin). It involves extraterrestrial radiation (Ra) for the certain location and time of the year that can be calculated by the following formula.$$Rs\\\\approx KRs\\\\sqrt{\\\\left({T}_{max}-{T}_{min}\\\\right)} Ra$$Wind speed is generally calculated at range of heights and has to be further transformed to a 2-m reference height. A measure of the evaporative pressure of the environment is known as ETo. It also decides both crop transpiration and soil evaporation rates. To determine ETo, AquaCrop requires station characteristics like latitude, altitude, and location. It can be calculated by means of a built-in ETo calculator Table 1.Table 1 Climatic data parameters required by AquaCropFull size tableSoil ProfileAquaCrop embraces physical as well as chemical parameters of the soil profile which are shown in Table 2. Sampling can be conducted from 120 cm soil depth (Vanuytrecht, Hsiao et al. 2014). Usually, soil profile study was allowed to demonstrate the soil characteristics at the experimental field and determine the analysis of physicochemical belongings. In this model, the condition of soil water in the lower, middle, and upper positions has been measured as the input of the AquaCrop model to predict the water use effectiveness of the sugarcane. Knowing soil physical characteristics (soil water content on SAT, FC, and PWP and hydraulic conductivity), by using that information, AquaCrop will drive other soil characteristics. These soil characteristics which obtained by using soil water content include TAW which determine the size of the soil reservoir in which water can be stored and REW which is readily evaporative water which is required to calculate soil evaporation and soil type. In the Wonji Shoa plantation, the whole soil’s physical characteristics come from the Wonji Shoa sugarcane estate research center.Table 2 Soil parametersFull size tableCropWhen we load crop file, AquaCrop load conservative parameters which are crop-specific do not change maternally with time, management practice, geographical location, climate, or cultivar. They are valid in all cultivars and environments. So, we do not need to calibrate and validate it. The parameters which need to be calibrated and validated are cultivar-specific, and the less conservative ones include field management, planting mode, condition in the soil, and climate. But nonconservative parameters are the parameters which are cultivator-specific and can be influenced by crop field rule, planting node, state of soil, etc.Parameters Affected by Field ManagementThe type of planting method may be direct sowing or transplanting. In Wonji Shoa plantation, transplanting is the method of planting.Plant density is important to calculate initial and canopy cover (cco˳) cc for canopy cover note for initial. The initial canopy cover is the moment of emergence. AquaCrop needs that for describing the canopy development in function time. ccocan be calculated as the plant density times the size of the canopy cover per seedling.For the time to 90% seedling emergence, we must specify the time since it is affected by field preparation, soil temperature, and soil water content. The time needed for 90% of seedlings of the Wonji Shoa case is about 3 months.Parameters Affected by Conditions in Soil ProfileMaximum rooting depth and the time to reach that depth are considered here. The rooting depth and the time to reach it are affected by soil’s physical and chemical characteristics such as temperature, mechanical impendence, aeration, pH, salinity, and high levels of aluminum and manganese. What we need to specify is the time to reach the maximum depth and the maximum rooting depth itself. AquaCrop uses the concept of effective rooting depth that is the soil depth where major crop water uptake takes place. The minimum effective rooting depth considered here is not zero, and it is about 0.2 or 0.3 m where the germinated seed can extract water. The effective rooting depth in Wonji Shoa plantation is 0.85–2 m, but when it has 5 routines, it sometimes reaches 3.2 m.Field ManagementAquaCrop simulates crop and soil interaction. Since it is affected by field management, it must be considered as well. There are parameters which vary with the type of field management. In AquaCrop, various types of field management are considered and include field surface practice, application of mulches, and effect of soil fertility.Field Surface PracticeThese are practices which used to reduce surface runoff. AquaCrop has methods to estimate surface runoff. Surface runoff is the part of rainfall that might be lost by surface run-off from the field and does not infiltrate. Surface runoff is simulated in AquaCrop by the curve number (CN) method from the SCS of the USDA. In AquaCrop, the infiltration rate is considered to calculate CN. The curve number is low for high infiltration rate. If the infiltration rate of the soil is low, the curve number will increase which will generate more runoff. Given the infiltration rate, AquaCrop will select the curve number, but that curve number varies with the condition of the topsoil.Determination of Net Irrigation Requirement (Inet)The resolution of net irrigation makes use of threshold. It is the allowable root zone depletion. When in the lack of rainfall, the irrigation volume drops below the allowable root zone; then, small amount of water will be injected into the root zone to keep the soil water content at that level for such day. Toward the end of the season, the sum of the added water is the net irrigation.$${\\\\textrm{I}}_{\\\\textrm{net}}=\\\\sum \\\\textrm{water}\\\\ \\\\textrm{added}$$These are net requirements because it does not consider extra water that has to be practical to the field to account for conveyance losses or the uneven distribution of irrigation water on the field. To run AquaCrop in the net irrigation mode, we need to specify the allowable root zone depletion which is expressed in a fraction of RAW (rarely available water). RAW is zero when the soil water content is in field capacity and 100% at the threshold for stomatal closure. So, the allowable root zone depletion is expressed in the percentage of RAW. The knowledge of the method is required because it determines which fraction of the soil surface is wetted. It is 40–60% in furrow, 30% in drip, and 100% in sprinkler and basin irrigation. In Wonji Shoa, the technique of irrigation is furrow.Condition in the Lower BoundaryThe lower boundary is all about the depth and the quality of the ground table. By knowing the depth of the ground table and its quality, AquaCrop can simulate the movement of water and salt from the groundwater to the root zone. The condition at the lower boundary can be constant or vary with time. The groundwater of WSSE is very shallow, experiencing great spatio-seasonal fluctuations and showing a rising trend. Such characteristics of GWTD are expected to negatively impact the socioeconomics and environment of the region, thus, a concern for the sustainability of the sugar estate. The mean average GWTD of the study area ranged between 0.2 and 2.0 m; thus, all plantation fields are classified to be shallow. The groundwater data of Wonji Shoa plantation used for Aqoacrop is a groundwater table with constant depth and salinity (1.5 m and 2.5 ds/m).Results and DiscussionClimate ProjectionThe projected climate result during the baseline and future period is described here. The result of downscaled RCM of more than 15 models for the 4.5 rcp (medium representative concentration pathway) and 8.5 rcp (high-representative concentration pathway) scenarios from 1990 to 2099 compared with the baseline (1990–2016) period data from Wonji Shoa sugar cane estate research center.Baseline ScenarioMaximum Temperature, Minimum Temperature, and PrecipitationThe monthly mean maximum, minimum temperature, and precipitation obtained from the RCM model (CORDEX) and with bias correcting give the following results for the baseline period (1990–2016) of both in 4.5 rcp and 8.5 rcp emission scenarios as shown in Fig. 3.Fig. 3Change in Tmin (2011–2099) at Wonji Shoa for both scenariosFull size imageThe monthly maximum and minimum temperatures for 4.5 and 8.5 rcp scenarios in the baseline period show a reasonably good agreement with the observed temperature for all months. Bias-corrected RCM model result performs reasonably well in estimating the mean monthly precipitation satisfactory given the fact that precipitation downscaling is necessarily more problematic than temperature.Downscaled RCM for Future ScenarioThe climate scenario result for the future period was developed from downscaled GCM for two representative concentration pathways (4.5 and 8.5 rcp) for 90 years, and the analysis was done based on four 20-year periods centered on the 2020s (2020–2039), 2040s (2040–2059), 2060s (2060–2079), and 2080s (2080–2099). All the comparisons in the following analysis were done with respect to the baseline period (1990–2016) data at Wonji Shoa research center.Maximum Temperature, Minimum Temperature, and PrecipitationThe downscaled minimum temperature shows an increasing trend for all months in all future time horizons for both 4.5 rcp and 8.5 scenarios. The average annual minimum temperature in the 2020s will be increased by 1.35 °C and 1.59 °C for 4.5 rcp and 8.5 rcp scenarios, respectively. For the 2040s periods, the average annual minimum temperature will be increased by 1.79 °C and 2.7 °C for 4.5 rcp and 8.5 rcp scenarios, respectively. For the 2060s periods, the average annual minimum temperature will be increased by 2.59 °C and 3.63 °C for 4.5 rcp and 8.5 rcp scenarios, respectively. For the late twenty-first century, the average annual minimum temperature will be increased by 2.79 °C and 4.09 °C for 4.5 rcp and 8.5 rcp scenarios, respectivelyFor Wonji Shoa, the overall analysis (2011–2099) of maximum temperature showed that there may be increasing trends in both scenarios (4.5 rcp and 8.5 rcp). The average annual maximum temperature in the 2020s will be increased by 1.21 °C and 1.16 °C for 4.5 rcp and 8.5 rcp scenarios, respectively. For the 2040s periods, the average annual maximum temperature will be increased by 1.48 °C and 1.93 °C for 4.5 rcp and 8.5 rcp scenarios, respectively. For the 2060s periods, the average annual maximum temperature will be increased by 1.52 °C and 2.98 °C for 4.5 rcp and 8.5 rcp scenarios, respectively. For the 2068s periods, the average annual maximum temperature will be increased by 1.97 °C and 4.17 °C for 4.5 rcp and 8.5 rcp scenarios, respectively. Increasing maximum temperature showed more variation at the monthly time step with arrange from 0.8 to 1.45 °C in 2020s, 1.01 to 2.6 °C in 2040s, 1.13 to 3.66 °C in 2060s, and 1.30 to 4.68°C in 2080s (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Change in Tmax (2011–2099) at Wonji Shoa for both scenariosFull size imageThe precipitation projection exhibited an increase in average mean precipitation in periods (2020s, 2040s, 2060s, and 2080s). As can be shown in Fig. 5, in all periods, there may be a decrease in precipitation for the months of May and September and an increase in all other months for both scenarios (4.5 rcp and 8.5 rcp). The overall effect in the 2020s may be an increase in average annual precipitation by 6.85 mm in the 4.5 rcp scenarios and 1.57 mm in the 8.5 rcp scenarios.Fig. 5Change in the mean of precipitation at Wonji Shoa for both scenariosFull size imageIn the 2080s, the overall effect may be an increase in average annual precipitation by 9.88 mm in the 4.5 scenario and 18.34 mm in the 8.5 scenario.AquaCrop Model ResultsCalibration and Uncertainty AnalysisCrop simulations were based on the cultivar N-14, which occupied 28 % of the sugarcane area at Wonji Shoa during the 2015/2016 season. Calibration of the model to this cultivar was done using the field data obtained in Wonji Shoa. Model performance was evaluated using the index of agreement, root mean square error (RMSE), and the coefficient of determination (R2)In AquaCrop calibration, the simulations performed focused on total biomass and yields. Through repeated simulation runs and output comparison (biomass and grain yields) of simulated versus observed yields, a set of values was arrived at for conservative parameters which seemed most appropriate and gave satisfactory results for the period of 1990–2006. For model validation, data from 2007 to 2016 were used. There was a good fit between the simulated aboveground biomass, and grain yield that agreed well with their corresponding observed data for all treatments during successful seasons had better fit (R2 = 0.89).Climate Change Impact on Sugarcane EvapotranspirationAquaCrop was produced by using downscaled climate data (Tmax and Tmin) and location (altitude, latitude) data of Wonji Shoa for future time. In the 2020s for the 4.5 rcp scenario, the Eto show an increase of about 121.13 mm and for 8.5 rcp scenarios by 293.08 mm. In the period of 2040s, the same trend continues an increase in 4.5 rcp by 168.24 mm and, for 8.5 rcp, an increase up to 390.08 mm is observed. In the 2060s for both scenarios, there is an increase in Eto by 190.3 mm for 4.5 rcp and 448.3 mm 8.5 rcp, respectively. In the 2080s, an increase of Eto is there for both scenarios having the value of 228.44 mm and 461.3 mm, respectively (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Average mean change of Eto for (A) 4.5 rcp scenario and (B) 8.5 rcp scenarioFull size imageClimate Change Impact on Sugarcane Irrigation RequirementFor the irrigated sugarcane crop, the climate impact on irrigation amounts was assessed, assuming the same future yields. To meet that yield, the assigned water for production gives us the clue about irrigation requirements. The difference in irrigation application between the baseline scenario and the future with the same yield is present here. In the 2020s for the 4.5 rcp scenario, the irrigation requirement shows any decreasing or increasing trends for successive four benchmarks. For 8.5 rcp scenarios, irrigation requirements show a decrease starting from the 2060s. In the 2060s, the requirement decreases by 5.22 mm, and in the 2080s, decreasing of irrigation requirement reached a value of 62.4mm.Climate Change Impact on Sugarcane YieldsClimate change impact on sugarcane yield was analyzed by comparing baseline yield and future yield for the 2020s, 2040s, 2060s, and 2080s. In the 2020s, for both scenarios, the yield showed an increase of about 2.80 ton/ha and 3.12 ton/ha for 8.5 rcp, respectively. In the period of the 2040s, the same trend continues, increasing in 4.5 rcp by 2.96 ton/ha, and, for 8.5 rcp, up to 3.13 ton/ha is observed. In the 2060s, there is an increase in yield both for 4.5 rcp and 8.5 rcp by 3.11 ton/ha and 3.22 tons/ha, respectively. In the 2080s, an increase in yield is there for both scenarios having the value of 3.02 ton/ha and 3.32 ton/ha, respectively.Climate Change Impact on Sugarcane BiomassClimate change impact on sugarcane biomass was analyzed by comparing baseline biomass and future biomass yield for the 2020s, 2040s, 2060s, and 2080s. In the 2020s for the 4.5 rcp scenario, the biomass shows an increase of about 14.01 ton/ha and for 8.5 rcp scenarios by 15.60 ton/ha. In the period of 2040s, the same trend continues in 4.5 rcp by 14.77 ton/ha and, for 8.5 rcp, up to 15.3 ton/ha is observed. In the 2060s also for both scenarios, there is an increase in biomass production for 4.5 rcp by 15.56 ton/ha and 8.5 rcp by 16.13 tons/ha, respectively. In the 2080s, an increase in biomass production is there for both scenarios having the value of 15.3 ton/ha and 16.61 ton/ha, respectively.Uncertainties in the StudyThere are various sources of uncertainties in climate change impact assessment works. The uncertainties for this study result from GCM outputs and problem related to AquaCrop model development. Unavoidably, the approach developed in this study which has linked climate scenarios and crop modeling has limitations. This study does not consider the possibility of future change in daily rainfall distribution within the seasons or changes in the frequency of extreme events such as droughts, heat waves, or cloudiness, which could substantially change the results discussed here. Climate scenarios have many uncertainties including that, in the future projections of climate generally stem from uncertainties in defining the factors (e.g., population growth, economic growth and development, energy use, control measures, transfer of clean technology to developing countries) that affect future emissions scenarios. Converting these emissions to atmospheric concentrations of the relevant greenhouse gases is also problematic.Any or all of the above uncertain', 'unique_identifier': 250}\n",

Kachapur Scientific Reports 14, Article number: 3958 (2024) Cite this article423 AccessesMetricsAbstractGlobal trends show that the rapid increase in maize production is associated more with the expansion of maize growing areas than with rapid increases in yield. This is possible through achieving possible higher productivity through maize production practices intensification to meet the sustainable production. Therefore, a field experiment on “Ecological intensification of climate-resilient maize–chickpea cropping system” was conducted during consecutive three years from 2017–2018 to 2019–2020 at Main Agricultural Research Station, Dharwad, Karnataka, India. Results of three years pooled data revealed that ecological intensification (EI) treatment which comprises of all best management practices resulted in higher grain yield (7560 kg/ha) and stover yield compared to farmers’ practice (FP) and all other treatments which were deficit in one or other crop management practices. Similarly, in the succeeding winter season, significantly higher chickpea yield (797 kg/ha) was recorded in EI. Further EI practice recorded significant amount of soil organic carbon, available nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, and iron after completion of third cycle of experimentation (0.60%, 235.3 kg/ha,21.0 kg/ha,363.2 kg/ha,0.52 ppm and 5.2 ppm respectively). Soil enzymatic activity was also improved in EI practice over the years and improvement in each year was significant. Lower input energy use was in FP (17,855.2 MJ/ha). Whereas total output energy produced was the highest in EI practice (220,590 MJ ha−1) and lower output energy was recorded in EI–integrated nutrient management (INM) (149,255 MJ/ha). Lower energy productivity was noticed in EI-INM. Lower specific energy was recorded in FP and was followed by EI practice. Whereas higher specific energy was noticed is EI–INM. Each individual year and pooled data showed that EI practice recorded higher net return and benefit–cost ratio. The lower net returns were obtained in EI-integrated weed management (Rs. 51354.7/ha), EI-recommended irrigation management (Rs. 56,015.3/ha), integrated pest management (Rs. 59,569.7/ha) and farmers’ practice (Rs. 67,357.7/ha) which were on par with others.Similar content being viewed by othersHalf of twenty-first century global irrigation expansion has been in water-stressed regionsArticle Open access08 March 2024Historical impacts of grazing on carbon stocks and climate mitigation opportunitiesArticle 15 March 2024The emergence of pesticide-free crop production systems in EuropeArticle 14 March 2024IntroductionMaize (Zea mays L.) is known as the “Queen of Cereals” and is one of the most extensively planted cereal crops in the world, ranking first in terms of production. Annual global demand for maize, rice, and wheat is predicted to exceed 3.3 billion tons by 2050 and this will have to happen from similar or perhaps much lower land resources1. The global average yield for maize has been increasing steadily over the period. Yields have been improving at a rate of 65 kg/ha/year2 since 1960 which accounts to steady rate of 10 million ton/year until 2004, after which they shifted to a steeper production of 31 M ton/year2. The increase in production closely follows the recent trend for maize area expansion, which had been increasing at a rate of 0.9 million ha/year prior to 2007 and, has now been increasing at the more rapid pace of 4.7 million ha/year. Simultaneously, the shifting climate and environmental degradation, changing climate, and diseases and insect pests are known threats to crop production and productivity, especially in the tropics. The increased output must be achieved with less land, water, energy, and other vital inputs, as well as a limited natural resource base. Agriculture in Asia faces new challenges because of climate change. Climate change is thought to have affected worldwide maize and wheat yields by 3.8% and 5.5%, respectively, since 1980. Climate change has an impact on crop yields as well as food availability and productivity of natural resources including land and water3,4. South Asia's natural resources are 3–5 times more stressed than the rest of the world due to demographic, economic, and political pressures4.After rice and wheat, it is India's third most important cereal. It accounts for 9.1% of the India’s total whole food grain production. About 20–25% of India's maize is used for human consumption, 60–65% for cattle and poultry feed, and 10–15% for food processing industries such as corn flakes, dextrose, starch, popcorn, corn oil, and corn syrup. The world's maize area is 192.50 million hectares, and it ranks first in production with 1,112.40 million metric tonne1. In India, maize is grown in an area of 9.6 m ha with 28.8 m t of production and 3006 kg/ha productivity, while in Karnataka it has 1.6 m ha of area with 4.2 m t of production and 2990 kg ha−1 productivity5. However, demand for maize in India by end of 2022 is estimated at 44 million metric tons. And not less than 15 million farmers are engaged in maize cultivation in India5. During the previous 5 years maize’s annual growth rate was 11% and is sourced for more than 35,000 products5.Despite several constraints, such as overdependence on rainfall, frequent climatic extremes such as drought, heat, and/or waterlogging, yield losses due to pre- and postharvest pathogens and insect pests, weeds, and lack of access to high-quality seed in some areas, several Asian countries have seen impressive growth rates in maize area, production, and productivity in recent years. However, alternative climate-smart, long-term intensification strategies in the tropics must be considered in addition. As a result, developing climate resilience in Asia necessitates a multi-disciplinary approach. More widespread understanding and implementation of climate-smart agronomic management practices, as well as the enhancement of local competencies and an emphasis on sustainability, are all part of this strategy. Maize is primarily grown as rainfed crops by smallholder farmers in most of Asia.Yield and yield components of corn were significantly affected by planting patterns, plant densities and maize hybrids6. Corn hybrids respond differently to high plant density7. Several researchers reported that the effects of row spacing and hybrids on maize dry matter yield and quality characteristics are variable7,8. Pest infestations can also be influenced by plant density or row spacing. Root maggots were minimized when the plant density was high (Delia spp.). On the contrary, high density reduced grain yield due to increased pollen to silking interval resulting in more barrenness of ears. However, it may lead to higher risk of lodging, hence causing significant yield loss of the crop9. Regional environmental condition is the key factor for determining the planting density, and reasonable cultivation techniques and appropriate density-resistant varieties are effective approaches to overcome environmental constraints and increase planting density10.Due to moderate organic matter oxidation, minimum soil cultivation restricts respiration gases in the rooting zone, porosity for water transport, retention, and release, and inhibits the re-exposure of weed seeds and their germination11. Irrigation is another key management strategy for increasing crop output and improving nutrient uptake. Irrigation frequency and total water application affect root dispersion and total root length12. This determines the physiological processes that are critical to plant growth. To attain higher yields, weed competition during the early phases of crop growth should be minimized13. Reduced crop-weed competition resulted in an increase in maize dry matter buildup, which led to improved yield characteristics and grain yield14.The performance of tembotrione as a herbicide has been presented at several conferences and through various scientific papers15,16. Topramezone and tembotrione are the new selective, postemergence herbicides introduced for use in maize that inhibit Hydroxy-phenyl pyruvate dioxygenase (4-HPPD) enzyme and the biosynthesis of plastoquinone15,17. Tank mixing of these herbicides with lower dose of atrazine was reported to be more effective than application of individual chemical. System Intensification using more biological inputs through best management practices, is the best alternative methodology for sustainable food, nutrition, ecological and health security18. The weed menace causes globally 11.5% and at national 10.9% production loss19.Turcicum leaf blight of maize (TLB) is a major foliar disease in maize and caused by Exserohilum turcicum (Pass.) Leonard and Suggs. (Synonyms: Drechslera turcica (Pass.) Subramanian and Jain; Bipolar isturcica (Pass.) Shoemaker; Helminthosporium turcicum (Pass.) Leonard and Suggs. The disease is known to affect maize from seedling to harvest. Loss in grain yield will be more if disease occurs before flowering, silking, and grain filling stages due to decreased photosynthetic area. The grain yield loss up to 46.7% has been reported due to TLB in maize20. As many as 141 insect pests cause different degrees of damage to maize crops from sowing to harvesting21. The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (E. F. Smith) (Noctuidae: Lepidoptera) has become a serious pest on maize in India and elsewhere. The pest has been very recently reported on maize from Karnataka for the first time in India22,23. It is an insect native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. During 2016, the FAW was noticed first in Karnataka and Central maize growing states of India and made the farmers feel panic about the incidence22. The fall armyworm larvae are a cosmopolitan, polyphagous pest which can feed on about 80 different plant species including crops such as corn, rice, small millets, sugarcane, alfalfa, soybean, sorghum, cotton, and vegetable crops23. The rapid spread of this pest in Indian states and Asian countries is due to its efficient ability to travel and migrate long distances in short time. Pest-related crop losses could amount to enough food to feed more than 1 billion people24. It is now obvious that other ways must be used to limit insect damage while avoiding the expense and unfavorable effects associated with synthetic pesticides because the use of synthetic pesticides poses additional obstacles. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a combination of several pest management approaches to supplement, minimize, or substitute the reliance of chemical pesticides. IPM encompasses simultaneous management and convergence of strategies, as well as consistent pest and natural enemy surveillance. IPM, on the other hand, is a lot more than merely a resource-saving technology. Due to land degradation, biodiversity loss, and climate change, soil has become one of the most vulnerable resources in the world. Achieving sustainability and increasing agricultural output are both possible with sustainable agricultural techniques. Climate smart agriculture, conservation agriculture and integrated soil fertility management and integrated pest management are agricultural technologies that are frequently marketed as supporting pathways to sustainable intensification (SI). These technologies also include carbon sequestrations, energy budgeting and green economy.In this context, a field experiment was initiated to enhance sustainable intensification of maize production in rainfed tropics by comparing farmers' methods to precision-conservation best practices comprising green technologies such as crop residue mulching, minimum tillage, integrated soil fertility, weed and pest management options.ResultsGrain yield of maize and chickpeaResults of three years pooled data revealed that ecological intensification (EI) treatment which comprises of best tillage, crop residue cover, planting density and genotype, precision nutrient management, application of water at critical growth stages, integrated weed, disease and insect management recorded significantly (p=0.05) higher grain yield (7560 kg/ha) and stover yield (8757 kg/ha) compared to farmers’ practice (FP) all and other treatments which were deficit in one or another crop management practices (T3, T4, T5, T6 and T8) (Table 1). In all individual years EI practice recorded significantly higher grain and stover yield. Whereas EI-INM recorded significantly lower grain and stover yield followed by EI-IWM. Similarly test weight and dry matter accumulation at harvest were also significantly higher in EI practice compared to other practices (Table 2).Table 1 Grain and stover yield of maize as influenced by ecological intensification in maize-chickpea system.Full size tableTable 2 Test weight and dry weight of weeds as influenced by ecological intensification in maize-chickpea system.Full size tableSimilarly in the succeeding winter season, significantly (p=0.05) higher chickpea yield (797 kg/ha) was recorded in EI all the years and the lowest was recorded in EI minus INM (539 kg/ha) (Table 3). Further EI practice showed a greater number of secondary branches and pods per plant compared to remaining practices at p=0.05 level of significance. In cropping systems, more than one species is involved, and it becomes very difficult to compare the economic produce of different nature. To express the yield advantage, the yields of individual crops in a system were converted into equivalent yield based on their economic value could be expressed in maize equivalent yield (MEY) (Table 3). Higher MEY in a system could be credited to yield advantages attained. Significantly more MEY was obtained in EI practice in both individual years (11,016, 1186, 8852 kg/ha during first, second and third year respectively) and pooled over three years (10,418 kg/ha). Whereas EI-INM recorded the lowest MEY, and it was on par with FP, EI-IWM and EI-IPM during individual years and pooled over three years at p=0.05 level of significance.Table 3 Chickpea yield and maize equivalent yield as influenced by ecological intensification in maize-chickpea system.Full size tableMajor disease and pest incidenceFall army worm (FAW-Spodoptera frugiperda, J. E. Smith) incidence was significantly higher on maize in EI-RPM (2.7%) followed by FP (1.4%) which was on par with other practices (Table 4). The FAW could threaten the food security and livelihoods of millions of small-scale farmers in Asia as the invasive crop-eating pest is highly likely to spread further from India, with Southeast Asia and South China most at risk. Among the system, FAW least infestation was noticed under EI practice (0.9%). Among the economically important diseases of maize, turcicum leaf blight (TLB: Setosphaeria turcica L.), regularly causes varying degrees of yield losses at national level. All the years EI practice recorded significantly lower disease severity score (6.0, 3.7, 4.9 during first, second, and third year respectively) and EI-IPM recorded the highest (8.0, 6.3, 7.2 during first, second and third year respectively) and it was on par with FP. EI showed significantly lower disease severity of 55.00 and 31.67% during the year 2018 and 2019 respectively and pooled mean value 43.33% which was significantly lower over the other treatments. Highest disease severity 65.00 and 72.00% was recorded in farmer’s practices during 2018 and 2019 respectively with mean pooled value 68.50%.Table 4 Turcicum leaf blight and fall armyworm incidence as influenced by ecological intensification in maize-chickpea system.Full size tableWeed dynamicsMajor weed flora associated with experimental site were grasses, sedges, and broad-leaved weeds. The important grassy weeds observed were Brachiaria eruciformis (Trin.) Griseb., Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers., Dinebra retroflexa Jacq. and Cyperus rotundus L., was under sedges category. Among broad leaved weeds, Ageratum conyzoides L., Alternanthera sessilis H. B and K., Commelina benghalensis L., Euphorbia geniculate L., Mollugo disticha Lamk., Parthenium hysterophorus L., Phyllanthus niruri Webster and Corchorus trilocularis L. were the dominant weeds. All these were smothered effectively in EI practice and their population and dry weight were significantly higher in FP at p=0.05 level of significance (Table 5).Table 5 Population and dry weight of weeds at 30 days after sowing as influenced by ecological intensification in maize-chickpea system.Full size tableEconomic analysis of practicesThe net return was calculated treatment wise by subtracting the total cost of cultivation from gross returns and expressed in rupees per hectare (Rs./ha). Whereas benefit–cost ratio was worked out by dividing gross returns from cost of cultivation. To assess the advantage of any production system, it is finally the economics of the system which plays a major role in its acceptance by the farmers. Net returns obtained in different cultivation practices varied significantly. Each individual year and pooled data showed that EI practice recorded significantly more net return (Rs. 76,338, 83,469 and 82,011 during first, second and third year respectively), and benefit–cost ratio (1.8, 3.2 and 2.7 during first, second and third year respectively) (Table 6). The lowest net returns were obtained in FP EI-integrated weed management (Rs.51354.7/ha) followed by EI-recommended irrigation management (Rs. 56,015.3/ha), integrated pest management (Rs. 59,569.7/ha) and farmers’ practice (Rs. 67,357.7/ha) over three years. Pooled net returns over three years also followed a similar trend with the highest net returns of Rs.80606/ha in EI practice. Further benefit–cost ratio of different cultivation practices varied significantly. In the first year and pooled data showed that B-C ratio was significantly higher FP which was on par with EI-INM and EI-RPM. The EI-IWM recorded the lowest B-C ratio followed by EI practice. B-C ratio varied year to year among the practices depending on yield obtained and cost invested at p=0.05 level of significance.Table 6 Economics of maize as influenced by ecological intensification in maize-chickpea system.Full size tableEnergetic analysis of practicesInput energy which considers labor engaged organics, fuel, seeds, fertilizers pesticides and irrigation cost varied in different practices. Significantly lower input energy use was in FP (17,855.2 MJ/ha), whereas significantly higher energy input was in EI (24,647 MJ/ha)which was on par with remaining practices (Tables 7 and 8). Whereas total output energy produced was the highest in EI (220,590 MJ/ha) and lower output energy was recorded in EI–INM (149,255 MJ/ha). Input and output energy calculated for remaining practices were on par with each other. Net energy also followed a similar trend to that of output energy. EI recorded higher net energy and on the contrary EI–INM recorded lower net energy. Energy use efficiency is cultural energy utilized through inputs and energy produced as products. FP revealed higher energy use efficiency followed by EI. Whereas lower energy use efficiency was reported in EI–INM. Similarly higher energy productivity was also recorded in FP followed by EI. Specific energy is energy required to produce per kilo of main product. So, it is understood that the lower the specific energy, the better the practice. Lower specific energy was recorded in FP and was followed by EI. Whereas higher specific energy was noticed is EI–INM. Efficient use of energy helps to achieve increased production and productivity and contributes to the economy, profitability, and competitiveness of agriculture sustainability in rural areas25,26.Table 7 Contribution of different production factors towards total input energy (MJ/ha).Full size tableTable 8 Energetic of maize as influenced by ecological intensification in maize-chickpea system.Full size tableSoil fertility statusAt initial stage of experimentation and after completion of each cycle of maize–chickpea cropping system, soil samples were analyzed for nutrient status in soil, the results showed that soil organic carbon (SOC) content in soil at the beginning of experimentation was deficit (0.43%) and it reached to medium (0.49 to 0.52%) in all the practices wherever crop residue was retained (Table 9). There was further improvement in soil organic carbon over the years and significantly more so in EI practice. Similar trend was recorded with respect to improvement soil available nutrient content in soil. EI practice recorded significant amount of organic carbon, available nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, and iron after completion of third cycle of experimentation (0.60%, 235.3 kg/ha,21.0 kg/ha,363.2 kg/ha,0.52 ppm and 5.2 ppm, respectively) which account to 27,46,23,10,68 and 22% improvement respectively over FP (Tables 9 and 10, Figs. 1 and 2). The comparison was made with initial value and results showed that FP recorded negative for organic carbon, available nitrogen, and phosphorus, DTPA extractable zinc and iron (Fig. 2). Whereas EI practice showed significant improvement of nutrient build up in soil. Further initial value in EI-INM did not show any improvement in nutrient status of soil compared to FP. And it recorded lower phosphorus and potash content in soil compared to FP. Whereas, other practices recorded increased nutrient status over the FP, but rate of increased linearity was less compared to EI practice. In FP, SOC, available nitrogen, and phosphorus remained deficit all through the years and it was on par with EI-INM practice.Table 9 Organic carbon and available nitrogen in soil as influenced by different ecological intensification treatments.Full size tableTable 10 Available phosphorus and potassium in soil as influenced by different ecological intensification treatments.Full size tableFigure 1Soil organic carbon sequestration and available nutrients contents after the harvest of the experiments during the experimental period.

In EI practice, pooled data showed that dehydrogenase and phosphatase increase was 26.6 and 33.7% over FP. EI-INM practice found on par with FP with respect to these two enzymatic activities in soil in all the years.DiscussionSustainability of productivity of maize–chickpea systemGrain yield of maize was significantly higher in EI practice as it comprised all recommended agronomic practices which included conservation tillage, crop residue cover, optimum planting density, precision nutrient management, application of water at critical growth stages, integrated weed, disease, and insect compared to FP and other treatments which were deficit in one or another best crop management practices. Grain yield was significantly higher in residue cover in comparison with conventional tillage and residue removed27. But in the case of EI-IWM, grain yield was not significantly influenced by residue cover (Table 1). In all three individual years also, EI practice recorded higher grain and stover yield due to improved test weight of grain and decreased weed population and their dry weight. The findings of higher maize yield under EI are in close agreement with other findings of reports of higher maize yield in conservation practice28,29,30,31. The higher yield of maize under EI could be attributed to the compound effect of better establishment of the crop due to favorable soil temperature and moisture conditions in soil, additional nutrients32, reduced competition for resources and improved bio-physico-chemical soil health over conventional farmers practice3,33. Precision-conservation agriculture, scale-appropriate mechanization and integrated nutrient management can help support sustainable intensification of maize-based cropping systems, helping to improve efficient use of soil, labor, water and nutrients34. Like maize yield, significantly higher chickpea yield (797 kg ha−1) was also recorded in EI all the years (Table 3). Further it showed a greater number of secondary branches and pods per plant compared to remaining practices as result of better soil fertility and soil moisture retention. Surface maintained crop residues act as mulch and therefore reduce soil water losses through evaporation and maintain a moderate soil temperature regime35. In cropping systems, more than one species is involved, and it becomes very difficult to compare the economic produce of different nature. To express the yield advantage, the yields of individual crops in a system were converted into equivalent yield based on their economic value could be expressed in maize equivalent yield (MEY). Higher MEY in a system could be credited to yield advantages attained. Significantly more MEY was obtained in was also significantly higher in EI practice in all individual years (11,016, 1186, 8852 kg ha−1 during first, second and third year respectively) and pooled over three years (10,418 kg ha−1) (Table 3). Whereas EI-INM recorded the lowest maize equivalent yield, and it was on par with FP, EI-IWM and EI-IPM during individual years and pooled over three years due to poor performance of maize–chickpea cropping systems in these practices. INM practice obtained significantly p≤0.01) higher grain yield (8.42 tons ha−1) than farmer dose of fertilizer27.Crop residue retention had lot of advantages as part of improvement in soil organic carbon, available nutrients and soil microbial activity are concerned. EI followed some principle of conservation agriculture (CA) which has three principles: (1) establishing crops with reduced tillage, (2) residue mulches on the soil surface, and (3) crop rotations36. The crop residues become mulch over the soil surface that protects the soil productive layer against runoff reducing the nutrient loss and erosion through runoff37,38 and increases the percentage of organic matter in the soil layer39. In EI practice, INM, IWM and IPM were the major tools for best crop production. They embrace soil, nutrient, water, crop, and vegetation management practices, tailored to a particular cropping and farming system, undertaken with the aim of improving and sustaining soil fertility and land productivity, and reducing environmental degradation. Precision INM aims to optimize the condition of the soil, about its physical, chemical, biological, and hydrological properties, for the purpose of enhancing farm productivity, whilst minimizing land degradation. Whereas EI-INM recorded lower grain and stover yield followed by EI-IWM as they recorded lower test weight and dry matter accumulation at harvest. It is well known that each of the nutrient elements plays a major role in growth and development of the plants, and when present in deficient quantities can reduce growth and yields40. One of the primary goals of the integrated strategy is to minimize the use of exogenous agriculture inputs like synthetic fertilizers and pesticides41. INM relies largely on the balanced application of appropriate fertilizers. Excess fertilizer usage does not result in significantly higher crop absorption of nutrients or yields. Furthermore, excessive nutrient applications are monetarily unproductive and may adversely affect the ecosystem. On the other hand, inadequate application might affect the crop growth and reduce yields in the short term while jeopardizing sustainability through soil exploitation, over time. Secondary nutrients and micronutrients that are also easily obtainable from organic fertilizers should also be included in a balanced fertilization42. The use of exclusively inorganic fertilizers causes nutritional imbalance, resulting in poorer yields and reduced yearly returns43.Weed managementWeed management in maize can be highly critical due to wider row spacing. Manual control of weeds growing between the rows is labor intensive. Herbicides weed control is an important alternative to manual weeding because it is cheaper, faster and gives better weed control in maize44. Weed problems are more severe during continuous rains in early stages of maize growth which cannot be controlled by traditional and cultural practices alone due to too much wetness and difficulty in hand weeding. Weeds reduce maize yield from 33 to 50% depending upon weed species and density45. Weeds compete with crops for light, moisture, space, and plant nutrients and consequently interfere with the normal growth of crops. It is known that there is a critical crop-weed competition period with grain losses reaching between 28 and 100% if weeds are not controlled46,47. Control of weeds in maize is, therefore, very important for obtaining higher productivity. Much of previous crop residue covered the soil and thereby reduced the weed menace in all the treatments except FP where residue was not retained on soil. Apart from FP and EI-IWM practices, which were affected by crop residue cover, the maize crop cultivated under the EI practice had a decreased population of weeds and their dry weight (Table 5). Establishment of weeds and emerged weeds were controlled by application of tembotrione at 2 to 3 leaf stage of weeds resulting reduced dry weight of weeds. Weed control practices in maize resulted in 77 to 96.7% higher grain yield than the weedy check48,49. EI-IWM showed more weed menace as IWM practice was not affected and only cultural method such as hand weeding has been done which was less effective under system of soil cover with residue. Perennial weeds have a persistence effect under EI-IWM and FP. The performance of Tembotrione and Topramezone as effective herbicides has been already established15,16,50. However, there are reports of residual toxicity and there is need to use of alternative herbicides to avoid build –up of residue in soil. Topramezone and tembotrione are the new selective, post emergence herbicides introduced for use in maize that inhibit Hydroxy-phenyl pyruvate dioxygenase (4-HPPD) enzyme and the biosynthesis of plastoquinone15,17. Residues of tembotrione and TCMBA persisted up to 60 days in soil and tembotrione show maximum leaching up to 25 cm in soil depth51. Therefore, tank mixing of these post emergence herbicides with lower dose of atrazine was reported to be more effective than application of individual chemical.Management of Fall armywormAnother two major pests of maize are recent invasive Fall armyworm (FAW) and turcicum leaf blight (TLB) and they influence significantly maize productivity. FAW incidence was significantly higher on maize in EI-IPM (2.7%) practice. In other practices the incidence of FAW was on par with FP (1.4%). IPM is also influenced by several factors. Each grower has their own strategy for producing crops, minimizing losses, and making a profit in a manner that is acceptable to the retailer, safe for the consumers, and less disruptive to the environment. In other words, IPM is an approach to manage pests in an economically viable, socially acceptable, and environmentally safe manner52,53. Among the systems, FAW least infestation was noticed under EI practice (0.9%) as control measures were initiated at right time with cultural and chemical measures as part of IPM strategy.

Evapotranspiration (ET) is commonly measured with a variety of instruments and field procedures, but it is also typically computed or modeled using the FAO56 or FAO66 methods. The adoption of this approach requires the assessment of the crop coefficients. Some data are available for own-rooted hazelnut trees, but no data have been reported for young and grafted hazelnut trees. There is a need to update nut–tree crop coefficients, especially considering modern cultivars and production systems, such as those with a high tree density per ha−1. In this paper, the FAO66 crop transpiration coefficient Kc,Tr and the FAO56 dual crop coefficients Kcb were assessed for the mid-growing season of a young grafted hazelnut orchard. The field data were acquired manually and using UAV. The coefficients were determined for three tree densities and for two growing seasons. The crop coefficients, obtained using the FAO66 method, agreed with the literature data referring to low densities, while the FAO56 method could allow us to better define the crop coefficients for high-density hazelnut orchards.Keywords: Tonda Francescana®; irrigation; ground cover; evapotranspiration; ET; own-rooted1. IntroductionWater scarcity, in relation to climate change, has become the main barrier to maintaining crop production, especially in Mediterranean areas [1,2,3,4]. Therefore, it is important to develop sensible irrigation strategies to reduce water use while maintaining adequate yields [5]. Many studies on the crop water requirements of vegetables have been produced since the publication of the FAO56 guidelines in 1998 [6] and FAO66 guidelines in 2012 [7] for the yield response to the water of fruit trees and vines. A recent review has shown that the determination of crop evapotranspiration (ETc), using the crop coefficient Kc—the reference evapotranspiration ET0 approach—is the most widely used method for irrigation water management [8]. Another recent study reviewed [9] the research on the FAO56 crop coefficients of fruit trees and vines performed over the past twenty years. It showed that many studies have been published for table and wine grapes, oranges, and olives. In addition, a few recent studies have been conducted on almonds (Prunus dulcis Mill. D. A. Webb) [9].To date, there is a lack of studies on the crop coefficients of hazelnuts (Corylus avellana L.), pecans (Carya illinoinensis L.), pistachios (Pistacia vera L.), and walnuts (Juglans regia L.) and their application in irrigation management. For hazelnut trees, only two recent studies have been identified [10,11]. The first one [10] was conducted on young trees from the “Itarski Dugi” cultivar in a micro-sprinkler orchard (833 plants ha−1) in Serbia. In this work, the soil water balance (SWB) was used to measure the reference evapotranspiration (ET0). The second [11] was conducted on hazelnut trees from the “Tonda Giffoni” cultivar in a drip-irrigated orchard (333 plants ha−1) in the Maule region in Chile. In this work, the eddy covariance system was used to determine the Kc. Past works used lysimeters to determine the hazelnut coefficients Kc of the cultivar “Negret”, grown in a Spanish orchard with 500 plants ha−1, and of the cultivars “Barcellona” and “Ennis”, which were grown in a French orchard with 416 plants ha−1 [12,13]. However, in the FAO56 [6] tabulated single basal crop coefficients for use with the FAO Penman–Monteith ET0, Kc values are not reported for hazelnuts, but only for walnuts and pistachios. In addition, all the aforementioned studies were carried out on own-rooted bush-trained hazelnut trees, produced by layering, with a low tree-planting density. Based on our knowledge, until now, no studies have been conducted on hazelnut trees grafted on not-suckering rootstock, such as “Corylus colurna” L., with a single trunk and a vase training system. A recent study showed that grafted plants may access deeper soil water layers in comparison with own-rooted ones and have the potential to more effectively tolerate thermal variations and drought conditions during the vegetative and productive seasons [14]. In light of the above factors, as already stressed by [9], there is a need to update nut trees’ crop coefficients, in particular for hazelnuts, while considering modern cultivars and production systems, especially those with increasing tree density.The aim of this work was to assess and compare the FAO66 crop transpiration coefficient Kc,Tr, and the FAO56 dual crop coefficients, Kcb, for the mid-growing season of young, grafted hazelnuts from a new, recently patented cultivar (n. EU52157). We make reference to three tree densities, ranging from one that is more common in traditional growing areas (lowest density) to those with many more trees, which are common in modern hazelnut orchards, highly mechanized, and always irrigated [15].2. Materials and Methods2.1. Study Site Description and Tree SamplingThe research was carried out in an experimental orchard of the Department of Agricultural, Food, and Environmental Sciences of the University of Perugia, located in Central Italy (42°58′22.82″ N, 12°24′13.02″ E), 161 m a.s.l., during the growing season of 2021 and 2022. The orchard has an area of about 2300 m2, and it is composed of 6 rows 4 m away from each other, each containing 43 trees divided into 3 plantation densities as follows:625 trees ha−1, spaced 4 m between rows and 4 m on the row, used as a control treatment (the common density used by farmers);1250 trees ha−1, spaced 4 m × 2 m;2500 trees ha−1, spaced 4 m × 1 m.The tree densities were chosen according to the past literature [12,16]. The low tree density is representative of traditional hazelnut orchards, while the medium and high densities are currently used in the new cultivation areas. Specifically, on the same row, the first 25 plants are spaced 1 m from each other, the next 12 are spaced 2 m apart, and the last 6 are placed 4 m apart. Each tree density is replicated three times, once per row.All trees, grafted on no-suckering rootstock, were trained as single trunks with four main branches each.The orchard is made up of trees belonging to two of the main Italian hazelnut cultivars, chosen for their higher productivity and early production: Tonda di Giffoni in the first three rows and Tonda Francescana® in the next three rows.In this paper, the trees studied belonged only to the hazelnut cultivar Tonda Francescana®. The meteorological data were monitored using a Spectrum (Thayer Court, Aurora) WatchDog 2000 Series Weather Station [17] located within the experimental site and were recorded at a time resolution of 5 min.The DJI (Shenzhen, China) Phantom 4 (P4) multispectral unmanned aerial vehicle UAV was used to assess the tree canopy and ground cover characteristics according to [18,19]. Moreover, the FAO66 procedure described in Section 2.3, calibrated for olives, was used to parametrize the Kc,Tr coefficients for the hazelnut orchard.2.2. Manual MeasurementsThe following data were acquired to fill the equations reported in Section 2.3.In other tree crops, corn (Zea mays L.), cotton (Gossypium arboretum L.), peanuts [20], soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) LAI was remotely estimated using photogrammetry and UAVs; studies have been performed to extract the LAI [21]. Very few studies have been carried out on tree crops, mainly on vineyards using higher spatial resolution remote sensing. This species is trained with the vertical shoot position trellis system or pergola system with horizontal shoot position [21,22], while hazelnut plant has a unique plant architecture with bush growth habit and dense foliage, three or four main branches, and canopy shape similar to the cylinder; all of this makes it more difficult to implement LAI models using UAV. For these reasons, in the present study, data determined using UAV referred only to canopy characteristics such as tree height.LAIplant (the leaf area index, that is, the ratio of the plant leaf area to the canopy cross-sectional area), LAIorchard (the ratio of the plant leaf area to the tree distance area), and LAD or DAF (the leaf area density) were measured and calculated following the procedure reported by [23] for 9 trees per growing season.The LAI values were manually measured using an iron bar (2.5 m long, 0.1 m wide, 0.1 m thick) with holes, for a total of 25 measurements, positioned 10 cm apart when a metal rod is inserted at a perpendicular angle; the iron bar is equipped with a level to keep the rods perpendicular to the ground. The iron bar is moved from the trunk to the inter-row by an operator, who inserts the metal rods and counts the leaves at the intersection points on a grid set up in the canopy. Measurements with this instrument were performed in two canopy directions, to the east side and the west side. The mean leaf area per tree density plantation was calculated with SigmaScan Pro5 (Richmond, CA, USA) program [24] by measuring the area of 30 leaves (5 for each tree) collected from the whole canopy.Moreover, ground cover was obtained as the ratio between the average canopy cross-sectional area and the ground area for each plant, equal to 16 m2, 8 m2, and 4 m2, respectively, from the highest to the lowest tree density plantation. The average canopy cross-sectional areas were calculated as reported by [19].The radiation intercepted from the tree Qd was measured manually using a luxmeter; this is a kind of ceptometer but is larger in size, as it consists of metal bars: a fixed one that is planted on the ground and horizontal to it, which is 150 cm long, and another piece of furniture perpendicular to the first, which is 100 cm long. The latter has a support on top to hold a special bar equipped with a photosensitive sensor, which generally consists of a transducer (a photovoltaic cell). When reacting to light intensity, it generates an electric current that is detected by a specific galvanometer equipped with a screen and connected with cables calibrated in lux. The movable bar can therefore slide in different positions along the horizontal bar, from 0 cm (ground) to 50 cm or 100 cm, and it can also be increased in height by means of a screw, from 0 cm (ground) to 100 cm. In this way, the intensity of light is detected at different heights of the plant and is compared with the light measured in full sunlight, revealing the light interception by the tree canopy. This parameter is important because there is a direct relationship between cumulative ET and PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) light interception by the tree canopy; a higher PAR light interception value corresponds to higher ET [25]. To obtain an estimation of the light interception by the whole tree canopy, the canopy light interception is expressed as the mean value of all data recorded at different distances from the trunk and tree heights. A completely randomized design (CRD) is the model used so that each experimental unit has the same chance of receiving any one treatment. For the CRD, any difference among experimental units receiving the same treatment is considered an experimental error.2.3. Evaluation of the Hazelnut Orchard’s Crop Coefficients Using the FAO66 MethodAs assessed by FAO66 [7], the canopy size and stomatal conductance are the two main parameters that determine tree transpiration Tr. Therefore, the models needed to calculate Tr in different orchards, as a function of the size and conductance of the tree canopy, must be specific for each tree species. Orchard ETc is considered the net irrigation requirement and, in well-managed irrigation systems, is the major component of the irrigation requirements. Orchard ETc may be calculated using crop coefficients and ET0, or by estimating its individual components, namely, transpiration and evaporation from the soil.Orchard or vineyard ETc may be calculated as the sum of four components [7]:ETc=Tr+TrCC+Ewz+Edz(1)where Tr is tree transpiration, Trcc is cover crop (or actively growing weed) transpiration, Ewz is the surface evaporation from the soil wetted by the emitters, and Edz is the surface evaporation from the rest of the soil surface outside the emitter wetting pattern.Evaluation of Tree Transpiration TrSteduto et al. [7] proposed a method to derive the tree transpiration Tr for an orchard, as follows:Tr=ET0·Kc,Tr(2)where Tr is the tree transpiration (mm); ET0 is the reference evapotranspiration (mm); and Kc,Tr is the transpiration coefficient, as follows:Kc,Tr=(Qd·F1)·F2(3)F1 depends on tree density, i.e., F1 = 0.66 for tree densities > 250 trees/ha. F2 is the monthly tabulated coefficient; in this case, F2 = 1.25 for June and July, and F2 = 1.20 for August.The parameter Qd is the radiation intercepted by the tree (fraction), calculated as follows:Qd=1−e−KextVu(4)withKext=0.52+0.00079·dp−0.76·e−1.25·DAF(5)Kext is the radiation extinction coefficient; dp is the tree density (trees/ha); and DAF is the leaf area density:DAF=2−0.53·(Vu−0.5),  (note:DAF  must  be<2)(6)withVu=V0·(dp10000)(7)where Vu is the canopy volume per unit ground surface (m3/m2), and V0 is the canopy volume (m3/tree):V0=16·π·D2·H(8)where D is the canopy’s average diameter (m), H is the canopy height (m), and e is the exponent equal to 2.718.The coefficients of Equations (5) and (6) were calibrated and tested for olives in a Mediterranean environment [26,27].For a preliminary evaluation of the method, Equations (5) and (6) were applied to the hazelnut orchard.In Equation (7), the canopy volume V0 was substituted with the volume Vc, evaluated using the procedure described by [18,19]. Briefly, volume Vc was calculated considering the shape of the canopy obtained from the 3D point cloud reconstruction using a UAV survey. From the raster file of the canopy, the volume was obtained in a GIS environment by evaluating the volume between the DSM and a horizontal plane passing through the lowest point of the same. Thus, the evaluation of the canopy volume per unit ground surfaceVu′(m3/m2) was made by substituting Equation (7) with the following formula:Vu′=Vc·dp10000(9)The tree density, dp, was set to be equal to 625 trees/ha, 1250 trees/ha, and 2500 trees/ha.The leaf area density, DAFFAO, was evaluated using Equation (6) withVu′:DAFFAO=2−0.53·(Vu′−0.5)(10)The DAFFAO was used for Equation (5), and by applying Equations (3) and (4), theKc,Trwas obtained.As described above, the coefficients of Equations (5) and (6) were derived for the olive orchards. Using manual measurements of the leaf area density for each tree density and for the whole growing season (reported later), the coefficients of Equation (6) were derived. Therefore, manual measurements of the radiation intercepted by the tree, Qd,m, were available. Thus, these were used in two ways:To calculate theKc,Trusing Equation (3);To derive the values of the productKext·Vu′from Equation (4). Substituting theVu′values, obtained from Equation (9), the radiation extinction coefficientsKextwere evaluated, and the coefficients of Equation (5) were determined for the hazelnut orchard.Student’s t-test was conducted to evaluate the significant differences between results obtained for the different plant densities.2.4. Estimation of the Hazelnut Orchard’s Crop Coefficients from the Fraction of Ground Cover and Height (Allen and Pereira [16])The FAO56 procedure for the estimation of the dual crop coefficient Kcb shows that it is largely affected by the fraction of the soil surface covered by vegetation. Recently, Allen and Pereira [6,15] suggested using a density coefficient Kd as function of tree heights. Focusing on orchards, Allen et al. [28] and Allen and Pereira [15] combined the influence of crop density with standardized values for Kcb full, Kcmin, and Kcb cover to compute a Kcb value for orchards for both bare soil and active ground cover. This modification provided flexibility in adjusting the value for Kc and Kcb according to the fraction of ground shaded by canopy, which is highly variable between orchards [29].The single Kc approach is not the most appropriate procedure for estimating crop ET for conditions with variable wetting of the soil surface, particularly when the ground cover is minimal. Changes in soil surface wetness are influenced by the frequency and duration of rainfall and irrigation events, as well as by the type of irrigation system or strategy employed, and these cannot be entirely accounted for using canopy cover estimates. This is particularly noticeable under the conditions of partial canopy cover, when soil evaporation (Es) is expected to be a considerable component of ET because increased energy reaches the soil’s surface. Due to this limitation, a dual Kc approach was developed to estimate crop ETc, which splits the Kc into a T (Kcb) component and an Es (Ke) component [6]:ETc=(Kcb+Ke)·ET0(11)The basal crop coefficient Kcb is defined as the ratio of the crop evapotranspiration over the reference evapotranspiration (ETc/ET0) when the soil surface is dry, but transpiration is occurring at a potential rate, i.e., water is not limiting transpiration. Therefore, ‘Kcb · ET0’ primarily represents the transpiration component of ETc.The basal Kcb is correlated with the amount of vegetation because it mostly represents transpiration. It can be expressed in terms of a density coefficient Kd, where [15]Kcb=Kcmin+Kd·(Kcbfull−Kcmin)(12)where Kcb is the approximation for conditions represented by the density coefficient Kd, Kcb full is the estimated basal Kc during peak plant growth under the condition of nearly full ground cover (or LAI > 3), and Kc min is the minimum basal Kc for bare soil (Kc min = 0.05 for orchards [30]). The coefficient Kcb full represents a general upper limit for tall vegetation with full ground cover and LAI > 3 under a full water supply; Kcb full, for use with ET0, can be approximated as a function of the mean plant height and adjusted for climate following [6]:Kcbfull=Fr·(min1.0+kh·h,1.20+[0.04·u2−2−0.004·RHmin−45]·h30.3)(13)where h is the mean maximum plant height (m), u2 is the mean value for wind speed at the height of 2 m during the midseason (m/s), RHmin is the mean value for the minimum daily relative humidity during the midseason (%), and Fr is an adjustment factor relative to crop stomatal control, described below. As assessed by Pereira et al. [31], the effects of crop height are considered through the sum(1.0+kh·h), with kh = 0.1 for tree crops.For trees and vines, the parameter Fr is high when crops exhibit significant vegetative vigor and decreases with pruning and training, as well as with limited water supplies [29]. Adopting the definition in [6] for Fr, considering the variability of leaf resistance between annual and perennial crops, it is assumed thatFr=∆+γ(1+0.34u2)∆+γ(1+0.34u2rlrtyp)(14)where rl and rtyp are, respectively, the mean leaf resistance and the typical leaf resistance [s m−1] for the vegetation in question, Δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure vs. the air temperature curve [kPa °C−1], and γ is the psychrometric constant, kPa °C−1, both relative to the period when Kcb full is computed. The original Fr was developed to empirically consider the effects of stomatal adjustment on Kcb full and, therefore, on Kcb, in response to water stress [6], since stomatal closure causes a decrease in transpiration and thus decreases Kcb and Kc. The stomatal adjustment process is well known for annual crops, while, for fruit trees, as for hazelnut orchards, it was less well known or unknown. Thus, the effect of the stomatal adjustment processes on transpiration could be characterized by the empirical adjustment of Fr. Some default Fr values were indicated by [15] for tree and vine crops.The density coefficient Kd can be estimated as a function of the measured leaf area index, LAI [m2 m−2], defined as the area of leaves per area of ground surface averaged over a large area:Kd=(1−e−0.7·LAI)(15)As described by [13], where estimates of the fraction of the ground surface covered by vegetation, fc, are available, the density coefficient Kd can be estimated as follows:Kd=min(1,MLfceff,fceff11+h)(16)where fc eff is the effective fraction of ground covered or shaded by vegetation [0.01–1] near solar noon, ML is a multiplier of fc eff that describes the effect of the canopy density on shading and on the maximum relative ET per fraction of ground shaded [1.0–2.0], and h is the mean vegetation height (m). Thus, using the Kd values obtained from Equation (15) and the measurement data of fc eff and h, the ML coefficient was estimated.3. Results3.1. Application of the FAO66 MethodUsing the measurements of the canopy’s average diameter D, the canopy height H, and the canopy volume obtained from the UAV survey [18,19],Vu′, the equations from (3) to (6) were applied to the hazelnut orchard for each plant density (Figure S1). The mean value for the midseason (June, July, and August) of the coefficientsKc,Tr, evaluated using the coefficients tested for olive orchards [7] are reported in the first row of Table 1. The resulting coefficients were significantly different for all the densities; in fact, Student’s t-test showed that the means were significantly different (α = 0.05).Table 1. Values of theKc,Trcoefficients derived from the FAO66 method [7] and using the coefficients derived from the hazelnut orchard.For a tree density of 625 trees/ha, the values of DAFFAO were always higher than 2, and Equation (6) was set for DAF values lower than 2; as such, an adjustment of the coefficients of Equation (6) seems to be necessary. Using manual measurements of the leaf area density DAFm for each tree density, as reported in Table 2, and for the whole mid-growing season, the coefficients of Equation (6) were derived:DAFm=1.79+2.83·Vu′(17)therefore, as described above, the manual measurements of the radiation intercepted by the tree, Qd,m, were available (Figure S2). Therefore, Equation (5) could be modified for the evaluation of the radiation extinction coefficient, Kext, as follows:Kext′=0.385+0.0047·dp+4.67·e−0.909·DAF(18)where dp is the tree density (trees/ha), DAF is the leaf area density, and e is equal to 2.718.Table 2. Values of the manual measurements of leaf area density DAFm, the intercepted radiation Qd, and the ground fraction cover fc.From the application of Equations (3), (4), (17) and (18), the coefficientsKc,Trwere evaluated and are reported in the second row of Table 1.The coefficients were significantly different only between the densities of 625 trees/ha and 2500 trees/ha and between the densities of 1250 trees/ha and 2500 trees/ha, since Student’s t-test showed that the mean was significantly different from 0 (α = 0.05).3.2. Application of the Allen and Pereira Method [15]The procedure detailed in [15] was used to derive the Kcb. Equation (14) was not applicable because the value of the mean leaf resistance (rl) is not available in the literature for hazelnut orchards. Due to these missing data, in this study, assuming a similarity in the water sensibility behaviors of hazelnut and walnut orchards [32], the Fr value of walnuts reported in Table 2 of [15] was used (Fr = 0.90). The values of the mean tree height measured using the UAV surveys [18,19] were used for the evaluation of Kcb full using Equation (13). The density coefficient Kd was calculated using the measurements of LAI conducted during the midseason and applied to Equation (15) (Figure S3). Thus, Equation (12) was used to estimate the values of Kcb, with Kc min = 0.05 [31]. The values obtained for the three tree densities (625 trees/ha, 1250 trees/ha, and 2500 trees/ha) are reported in Table 3.Table 3. Values of the coefficientsKcbderived from the application of the Allen and Pereira [13] method (KcbA&P).From the values of the density coefficients Kd, calculated using Equation (15), Equation (16) was inverted to estimate the ML coefficient as described by [8]. In particular, the fc eff values were obtained from the following equation:fceff=fcsin(β)(19)where β is the mean angle of the sun above the horizon during the period of maximum ET, evaluated using the procedure described by [6]; fc is the fraction of the surface covered by the vegetation, measured from the UAV surveys, described in Vinci et al. [18,19]. The coefficients were significantly different only between the densities 625 trees/ha and 2500 trees/ha and between the densities 1250 trees/ha and 2500 trees/ha, since Student’s t-test showed that the mean was significantly different from 0 (α = 0.05).The values of ML obtained were ML = 1.17 for 625 trees/ha, ML = 1.09 for 1250 trees/ha, and ML = 1.01 for 2500 trees/ha.4. DiscussionPereira et al. [8] suggest that the selection of Fr and ML values is performed through a numerical search for the values of the parameters that make Kcb match the tabulated Kcb TAB values. However, as noted by Rallo et al. [9], studies for hazelnut trees are lacking, and Kcb tabulated values are not available for hazelnut orchards. The values of fc measured and used for the analysis were in accordance with the values of fc reported for walnut by [8], and for these values, the Kc mid was around 1 (Figure 1).Figure 1. Crop coefficients reported for hazelnut and for walnut in the literature [7,9,10,11,12,13] and those determined in this research, for several tree densities.Figure 1 shows the crop coefficients reported for hazelnuts and for walnuts in the literature and those determined in this research, for several tree densities. The highest tree density of 2500 trees ha−1, used in this study, was not reported in Figure 1 since it has never been used by farmers, and no data are available.The Kc,Tr determined in this research for 625 trees ha−1 density was similar to that reported by Silvestri et al. [12] for 500 trees ha−1 for own-rooted young hazelnuts. On the other hand, it was higher than that suggested by FAO66 [7]; this may be because the Kc used was calibrated and tested for olives. In fact, olive trees are an evergreen and resilient species that are well adapted to the Mediterranean environment [26,27,33]; meanwhile, hazelnut is sensitive to water stress and prefers cooler and more humid environmental conditions [34,35]. However, for the medium density (1250 trees ha−1), the Kc,Tr determined for hazelnut in this research was very similar to that of FAO66 [7]. This could be related to the species-specific physiological responses under changing light absorption conditions and nutrient availability. The values of the coefficients Kcb determined in this study by using the Allen and Pereira method [6] resulted in the highest values among those reported in the literature for hazelnuts (Figure 1). We suppose that, in applying this method, we overestimated the Kcb values for hazelnuts, with values very similar to those reported for walnuts (Figure 1).Allen and Pereira [6] suggested a relationship between Kc and plant height in connection with the net radiation increment. However, we did not find any differences between the Kcb values of the two plant densities shown in Figure 1. This could be due to the specific training shape of hazelnut trees, which have four branches and no single axis. Therefore, the hazelnut tree’s height does not reflect the actual tree shape and canopy volume, especially in young trees. On the other hand, the Kc,Tr determined in this research for both crop densities was lower than the values reported in the literature for hazelnuts (Figure 1). The higher Kc values reported by Mačkić et al. [10] were probably due to the higher planting density and the specific orchard irrigation method. The higher Kc values reported by Mingeau and Rousseau [13] and by Ortega-Farias et al. [11] could be related to the specific orchard characteristics and management practices.However, since the Kc,Tr determined in this research for grafted plants turned out to be lower (0.61–0.65), albeit with a higher planting density, than those reported in the literature for own-rooted plants (Figure 1), we cannot overlook the effect of grafting on hazelnut crop coefficients. In fact, as reported by Portarena et al. [14], the deeper root systems of grafted plants compared with own-rooted plants lead to differences in the depth of the root water uptake and in physiological functioning at the whole-plant level. It is likely that grafted hazelnut trees also have better radiation interception with a lower LAI (Figure S3) compared to those recorded for own-rooted trees of the same age by other authors [36]. All these factors reflect the stomatal control capacity of trees and the entire orchard’s water requirements, improving orchard sustainability.5. ConclusionsFor the first time for grafted hazelnut trees on non-suckering rootstock, Kcmid has been assessed for the evaluation of the water demand of young hazelnut trees in a high-density orchard.The values of the density coefficient Kd did not differ among the three tested densities, a result that conflicted with the method of Allen and Pereira (2009), who suggested a relationship between Kd and the tree height. Moreover, the Kcb estimated in our grafted orchard was lower than the values reported in the literature for own-rooted hazelnuts. These lower values could be primarily related to the specific local environmental conditions, the cultivar, and the orchard management system, including the grafting practices employed.Further studies are needed to determine the Kcb for grafted adult hazelnut trees. Against this background, further research will be conducted to evaluate the Kc ini and Kc end values of grafted hazelnut trees in order to schedule a well-planned and efficient irrigation practice based on the orchard’s water requirements.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/w15091683/s1.

To mitigate this issue, some technologies that allow the maintenance of the ideal soil moisture for the uptake process are being investigated. Considering this, we hypothesize that the use of water treated with a magnetic field can increase water use efficiency in lettuce crop production. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of the irrigation rate of magnetically treated water on biomass accumulation and nutrient uptake by lettuce plants. An experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with a 2 × 5 factorial arrangement of two water sources (conventional water and magnetically treated water) and five irrigation application rates to replace crop evaporation: 25, 50, 75, 100, and 125%, with five replicates. The use of magnetically treated water increased the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in leaves, meaning that it induced higher nitrogen assimilation, leading to increases in agronomical characteristics (leaf number, fresh and dry shoot weight, fresh and dry root weight). The conclusions of this study showcase that magnetically treated water has beneficial effects on lettuce plants, improving their nutritional status and yield. Moreover, the results presented can lead to an increase in water use efficiency, thus optimizing irrigation management.Keywords: Lactuca sativa; magnetic field; nutrients; water depth1. IntroductionLettuce (Lactuca sativa) is one of the most produced, commercialized, and consumed vegetables in Brazil, as it can be produced all year round and has desired culinary characteristics and consumer acceptance [1].A common feature of leafy vegetables, such as lettuce, is the large transpiration area. Thus, the cultivation of these vegetables, in general, requires irrigation technology for water supply to guarantee the crop needs [2]. In addition to water availability, nutritional balance is another critical factor for lettuce development. Plant growth and development depend on a balanced supply of macro- and micronutrients, and the amount varies depending on the developmental stage and environmental and stress conditions, where excesses and deficiencies of macro- and micronutrients can be harmful to the plant metabolism [3]. These two factors (water and nutritional balance) are intrinsically linked since nutrient uptake, transport, and translocation are water-dependent during all phases of plant growth and development [4,5,6]. Nutrient uptake by plants is directly influenced by soil tension, which affects plant development through low nutrient uptake values [7].Irrigation in agriculture may increase crop productivity because the water supply can be regulated to each crop species according to the specific demand, avoiding the deficit or excess of water. Brazil has an extensive irrigated area, counting approximately seven million hectares, being among the ten largest irrigated areas in the world [5]. However, the quantity of available irrigation water has decreased over the years, driving the development of strategies to reduce water consumption without impacting the productivity of crops that are dependent on irrigation systems.The effects of a severe deficit of water, depending on the phenological stage of the plant, may be irreversible, preventing the plant from completing its cycle [8]. This process occurs because the plant suffers a reduction in leaf area, as well as in the number of stomata, which consequently leads to a decrease in the absorption of water and nutrients, thus reducing photosynthesis activity [9,10], due to photo-oxidation and degradation of chlorophyll [11].To mitigate this issue, some technologies that allow the maintenance of the ideal soil moisture for the uptake process are being investigated [12]. In this context, studies using magnetically water treatment in irrigation systems demonstrate positive effects such as an increment in the soil moisture and a reduction in the volume of water applied [13,14,15], resulting in increased nutrient uptake by the plants. In addition, gains in the yield were observed. Beneficial effects of irrigation with magnetically treated water were reported for tomatoes [16,17], wheat [18], and eggplant [19]. The authors related these results to the fact that the magnetic field is able to cause alternations in the osmotic pressure, resulting in the improvement of cellular capacity to absorb water [20]. The desired effect of magnetically treated water on nutrient uptake may be attributed to an increase in membrane permeability by reorientation of membrane phospholipids, which subsequently affect sodium and calcium channels in the membrane, leading to the entry of ions into the cell [21,22].Several studies characterized the magnetically treated water and pointed out alterations in pH, electrical conductivity, tension, and adsorption [23,24,25]. The magnetically treated water, once applied in the soil, was reported to lead to changes, such as the reduction of water retention in the ground, thus providing a decrease in water tension, which was related to the alterations in the water structure [26,27].The achievement of water and nutrient balance in plants may influence the enzymatic and photosynthetic activity (chlorophyll and reactive oxygen species), as well as primary metabolisms [28,29,30,31,32,33,34]. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of magnetically treated water on the nutrient concentration and yield of lettuce plants, a leafy vegetable, in two cultivation cycles, under rain-protected conditions, and in different irrigation rates of water supply.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Experimental AreaThe experiment was conducted from January to May 2013 in a greenhouse located in the experimental area of the Department of Rural Engineering of the São Paulo State University (UNESP), Botucatu City, São Paulo state, Brazil, at geographical coordinates 22°51′ S, 48°26′ W and altitude of 786 m [35]. According to the Köppen classification [36], the region has a Cfa-type climate (humid subtropical).The experiment was conducted under a rain-protected environment in a tunnel greenhouse measuring 27 m in length and 7 m in width, with a side height of 1.7 m and a center height of 3.0 m. The cover consisted of 150-μm-thick clear additive polyethylene film, and the sides were covered with 30% shade cloth to intercept insects and animals. The length of the greenhouse was oriented from north to south.The soil in the ground of the greenhouse, where the experiment was conducted, is classified as Dystric Ferralic Nitisol (Rhodic) (according to the World Reference Base for soil resources—WRB) with a moderate medium/clayey structure. The soil chemical characteristics were determined according to Raij [37] and presented as follows: CaCl2 pH 5.9, organic matter 24 g dm−3, P (resin) 191 mg dm−3, H + Al 17 mmol dm−3, K 4.8 mmol dm−3, Ca 68 mmol dm−3, Mg 25 mmol dm−3, sum of bases (SB) 97 mmol dm−3, cation exchange capacity (CEC) 114 mmol dm−3, bases saturation index (V%) 85 mmol dm−3, B 0.51 mg dm−3, Cu 4.8 mg dm−3, Fe 14 mg dm−3, and Zn 8 mg dm−3.The greenhouse soil was prepared using a micro tractor with a rotating hoe that churned up a surface soil layer of approximately 30 cm. Subsequently, the plots were marked, where each plot had a total area of 5 m², and the rows were made with a standard hoe. Weed control was performed manually when necessary.Soil matric potentials (Ψ) were calculated from disturbed soil samples, according to Richards [38]. The soil moisture values as a function of the matric potentials were: 26.62, 20.96, 19.93, 18.41, 15.8, 15.59, and 14.8 kg kg−1 for potentials of 10, 30, 50, 100, 300, 500, and 1500 kPa, respectively.2.2. Planting and Plant ManagementTo produce lettuce seedlings (Lactuca sativa), pelleted seeds of the Verônica variety were used. One seed per cell was sown in 128-cell expanded polystyrene trays using the commercial Tropstrato substrate (HA-Hortaliças) (pine bark, peat, expanded, and vermiculite). After the seeds had been sown, the trays were kept in a nursery for three days, and to assist the germination, an automatic misting system was used, triggered every 2 h.Before transplantation, all plots in the greenhouse were irrigated with an automatic misting system to reach the field capacity, calculated using the retention curves (−10 kPa) [39,40].The germinated seedlings were transplanted to the greenhouse soil, where the experiment was conducted. The spacing between plants was 0.25 m × 0.30 m, and a total of 50 plants were used per plot.In the first 7 days after transplanting (DAT), no difference in the irrigation water was applied, and during this period, the irrigation rate was equal for all the plots.After this initial period, the irrigation was applied according to the treatments twice a day: once in the morning and once in the afternoon.Two cycles of the culture were performed, with 35 days each. The establishment of the second cycle follows the same management and plot locations, with 7 days interval between the cycles.2.3. Experimental Design and TreatmentsThe experimental design comprised a factorial 5 × 2, with randomized blocks and five replications. Repetition comprised five lettuce plants. Treatments consisted of five irrigation water application rates based on the percentage of the replacing water lost to crop evaporation: 25, 50, 75, 100, and 125% and two water sources: conventional water (CW) and magnetically treated water (MW).2.4. Conventional Water and Magnetic Treatment of WaterIn this study, a magnetizer (Sylocimol Rural) was used to obtain the MW. The equipment used is capable of magnetizing 1000 L of water in 20 min and was developed with permanently oriented magnets and stainless steel that exposes the water to a magnetic field of 3860 Gauss or 0.386 T. The magnetic water was stored in tanks of 500 L capacity, and magnetization was kept constant.For the chemical monitoring purpose of the CW and MW, macro- (P, K, S), micronutrients (Cu, Mo, Zn, Fe, Mn, Ni), Na, Ba, Cd, Cr, pH, and electrical conductivity (EC) were determined. Magnetic water samples were taken right after magnetic treatment, before application, and carried out for 96 h at 0; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 12; 24; 48; 72; and 96 h after the sample. The analytical determinations for both CW and MW were carried out by atomic emission spectrometry NexION 300D (PerkinElmer) with inductive plasma. The results for CW chemical characterization are presented as follows: P 147 μg kg−1, K 575 μg kg−1, S 254 μg kg−1, Cu 1.94 μg kg−1, Mo 0.30 μg kg−1, Zn 19.7 μg kg−1, Fe 8.92 μg kg−1, Mn 0.78 μg kg−1, Ni 0.33 μg kg−1, Na 3464 μg kg−1, Ba 21.9 μg kg−1, Cd 0.31 μg kg−1, Cr 0.45 μg kg−1, pH 7.33, and EC 68.1 μS cm. The results for MW chemical characterization are presented in Figure 1.Figure 1. Chemical characterization of water treated magnetically. The monitoring was performed for 96 h (0; 1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 12; 24; 48; 72; and 96 h after treatment).

Irrigation ManagementA drip-type irrigation method was used with two independent systems: one for CW and another for MW. Each system was counted with an independent water tank with 500 L of capacity, and pressure gauges were set to regulate the operation, which was kept at 10-m water column (mWc) pressure. For the MW system, piping was built to allow the MW to return to the tank, and the water was constantly magnetized.The main irrigation line consisted of a 1-inch-diameter hose, and all lateral lines were directly inserted into this main line. For the application of the different treatments, a pipe record was installed for each drip line.Each plot was irrigated with three lines, with 0.30 m of space between drippers, at a mean flow rate of 1.472 L h−1 and pressure of 10 m.c.a.The reference evapotranspiration of the crop (ETo) (mm day−1) was determined by the following equation:ETo = kc.Kp.Eca(1)where kc is the crop coefficient (dimensionless), Kp is the coefficient of the class A tank (dimensionless), and Eca is the evaporation of the class A tank (mm day−1).The crop coefficient (kc) adopted was the one recommended by Allen et al. [41], which at the beginning (up to 7 DAT) was 0.7 (CW for all the treatments), for the half-season 8–21 DAT) was 1.0 (CW and MW, according to the treatments), and at the end (22–35 DAT) was 0.95 (CW and MW, according to the treatments).The correction coefficient (Kp) of the class A tank was calculated using the equation proposed by Snyder [42]:Kp = 0.482 + 0.024 ln (b) − 0.00376*W + 0.0045*RH(2)where b is the border of the vegetation area around the class A tank (m2), W is the wind speed at 2 m in height (km day−1), and RH (maximum and minimum) is the mean relative humidity (%).For the Kp calculation, propose b and W were disregarded, as no vegetation around the class A tank and no wind incidence were presented. A meteorological shelter (inside the greenhouse) containing a digital thermohygrometer was used to monitor the temperature (maximum and minimum) (T) and relative humidity (maximum and minimum) (RH) of the environment. The readings were performed daily at 9:00 a.m. (Figure 2).Figure 2. Temperature (Tminimum and Tmaximum), relative humidity (RHminimum and RHmaximum), and evapotranspiration from January to May 2013. Botucatu, São Paulo, Brazil. (A) 1st cycle; (B) 2nd cycle of the experiment.The evaporation (Eca) was monitored daily with a class A tank.To adjust the irrigation water, a distribution uniformity test was performed for the irrigation system, following the procedure proposed by Merriam and Keller [43]. Four lateral irrigation lines were selected, located at the beginning (0 m), at 1/3 (1 m), at 2/3 (2 m), and at the end (3 m) of the derivation line. Four emitters were selected in each lateral line at the same points. Water flow measurements were taken to calculate the coefficient of uniformity (CU) by the following equation:CU = q25/qa(3)whereq25is the average of the 25% lowest flow rate values collected (L h−1), andqais the average flow rate measured (L h−1).To calculate the water sheet to be applied, the application intensity (I) of the system was determined by the equation:I = q/Sd*Sl’(4)where q is the flow rate (L.h−1), Sd is the spacing between drippers (m), and Sl’ is the spacing between lines (m).The irrigation was realized daily, and the irrigation time (Ti) (min) was determined by the following equation:Ti = Eto/Ea*I(5)where ETo is the evapotranspiration of the reference crop (mm day−1), Ea is the water application efficiency of the system (dimensionless), and I is the intensity of application.2.6. Soil Moisture, Plant Harvest, and Determination of Plant NutrientsDuring the two cycles, soil water tension was measured daily using a set of three tensiometers (Hidrodinâmica) per plot.The plant harvest was performed 35 DAT for the 1st and 2nd crop cycles, where the border plants were disregarded, and only central plants were evaluated. On these occasions, the leaves were cut from the stalk, the number of leaves was counted, and the fresh mass was obtained. Roots were removed from the soil, washed, and the fresh mass was obtained.To obtain the dry mass of the root and shoot and to quantify the concentration of elements in the shoot, the shoot was washed with deionized water, and the shoot and root were dried in a convection oven for 72 h at 65 °C. After, the dried material was weighed to obtain the dry mass. The shoot was crushed in a Wiley mill (Tecnal Equipamentos, Piracicaba-SP, Brazil) and sieved through 1 mm mesh. Macro- (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and S) and micronutrients (Fe, B, Cu, Mn, Zn, Si, and Na) in the shoot were determined according to the method proposed by Malavolta et al. [44].2.7. Statistical AnalysisAnalysis of variance (p ≤ 0.01) with the F test was used to determine the effect of the different irrigation application rates and water types on the lettuce plants and was performed separately for each cycle. When the F test was significant for the interaction between the factors, the unfolding of the interaction was carried out. When the F test was significant for application rates (quantitative), adjust of regression analysis (p ≤ 0.01) was performed, and the model with the lowest p-value or highest coefficient of determination (R2) was used. In the soil water tension analysis, the paired t-test was used for each treatment, in which the presence of a significant difference was compared point-to-point [45,46]. Principal component analysis was also performed using the Past 4.10 software.3. ResultsWe observed that irrigation with magnetically treated water resulted in greater nutritional increments and greater accumulation of shoots.3.1. Influence of Magnetic Treatment on Soil MoistureThe replacement rates of 25% and 50% ET0 in both cycles increased the tension in comparison to the other ET0, reaching −80 kPa at the end of the cycles, which demonstrates low water availability in the soil (Figure 3A–D). MW showed a reduction in soil water tension, at the end of the cycle, under 50% ET0, compared to the CW. The replacement rate of 75% ET0 showed intermediate values, reaching maximum values of −20 kPa at the end of the cycles (Figure 3E–F), and the replacement rate of 100 and 125% showed the lowest values, reaching maximum values of −10 to −14 kPa, constantly maintained along the cycles (Figure 3G–J).Figure 3.

CW = conventional water; MW = magnetic water.3.2. Influence of Magnetic Treatment on Shoot Concentrations of MacronutrientsThe application of magnetic and conventional irrigation water sheets promoted changes in the concentrations of macronutrients in lettuce leaves (Figure 4 and Figure 5). However, for K and S, no significant differences were observed.Figure 4. Lettuce as a function of replacement rates and two types of water in two cycles.

CW: Convention water, MW: Magnetic Water, ns: No significance.Data analysis showed that, for the N concentration (p < 0.01), there was an interaction between water type and irrigation depth. The magnetic treatment of water positively influenced the nutrient uptake by lettuce plants. In both cycles, N levels showed a similar trend, where plants irrigated with conventional water and plants irrigated with magnetically treated water showed a second-order effect as a function of the different replacement rates, with maximum levels when an ET0 of 80% was approached (Figure 4A,B). The P content did not show any effect on the cycle for the type of water and irrigation depth (p < 0.05) (Figure 4C,D). However, an increasing linear effect was observed for P in both CW and MW treatments as the ET0 increased. At the 75 and 100% replacement rates, there was greater accumulation when plants were irrigated with MW (p < 0.05).For the macronutrient Ca (Figure 5A,B), a reduction in the contraction was verified as a function of the irrigation depths (p < 0.01). However, higher contents were verified for irrigation with MW under 100% ET0 in both cycles. Regarding Mg, a decreasing linear effect was observed for the treatments irrigated with CW and MW as the ET0 increased (p < 0.01) (Figure 5C,D), and the same trend as Ca was observed, where higher contents were verified for irrigation with MW under 100% ET0 in both cycles.3.3. Influence of Magnetic Treatment on Shoot Concentrations of MicronutrientsFor the micronutrients Fe, B, Zn, Si, and Na, no differences were observed. Regarding Cu (Figure 6A), in the 1st cycle, higher contents were observed in plants that were subjected to MW as the ET0 increased (p < 0.05). Nevertheless, a decreasing linear response occurred with CW. In the 2nd cycle, in general, MW showed a higher Cu concentration compared to CW (Figure 6B). For Mn (Figure 6C,D), a decreasing linear response was observed in the treatments irrigated with CW and MW (p < 0.01), where MW showed higher Mn concentration in comparison to CW for 25, 50, and 100% ET0 for the 1st cycle (Figure 6C) and for 50, 75, and 100% ET0 for the 2nd cycle (Figure 6D).Figure 6.

Significant regression models with * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001 and R² as the correlation coefficient. CW: Conventional water, MW: Magnetic Water, ns: No significance.3.4. Biometric ComponentsThe fresh root mass of the plants showed a similar trend in both cycles, in which the plants irrigated with CW showed a linear response, and those irrigated with MW showed a second-order reaction, with a maximum accumulation of approximately 80% of the replacement rate, reaching 12 g plant−1 (Figure 7A,B). For the 1st cycle, MW showed higher fresh root mass for all ET0 in comparison to CW (Figure 7A). In the 2nd cycle, MW overcame CWs higher ET0.Figure 7. Fresh mass of the root for first cycle (A); fresh mass of the root for two cycle (B); dry mass of the root for first cycle (C) and dry mass of the root for second cycledr (D) of lettuce as a function of replacement rates and two types of water. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean (n = 4). Significant regression models with * p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05 and R² as the correlation coefficient. Cycle, CW: Conventional water, MW: Magnetic Water, ns: No significance.For dry root mass, no adjustment was obtained in the 1st cycle for the data; however, MW showed higher values, in comparison to CW, for 25, 50, and 100% ET0 (Figure 7C). For the 2nd cycle, magnetic water did not show curve adjustment; however, it presented higher values in comparison to CW for all ET0, except for 75% (Figure 7D).The use of magnetically treated water positively affected the biometric components of the lettuce plant, as well as the effect of the water replacer rates. Regarding the number of leaves (Figure 8A,B), when the plants were irrigated with magnetically treated water, the effect for both cycles was of the second-order, close to an ET0 of 80% when a higher number of leaves was estimated.Figure 8. Biometric component of lettuce as a function of replacement rates and two types. Leave number: (A) 1st Cycle (B) 2nd Cycle; Accumulation of fresh shoot mass: (C) 1st Cycle (D) 2nd Cycle; shoot dry mass: (E) 1st Cycle and (F) 2nd Cycle.

Cycle, CW: Convention water, MW: Magnetic Water, ns: No significance.The fresh shoot mass (Figure 8C,D) showed a trend similar to that of the leaf number. Nonetheless, the maximum accumulation occurred when the plants were irrigated with 75% of ET0 and MW, reaching 310 g plant−1, while irrigation with 75% of ET0 and CW reached calculated values of 243 g plant−1. Even when irrigated with a higher replacement rate when CW was used, the plants did not get the same fresh mass accumulation compared to MW. A similar trend was observed for the dry shoot mass (Figure 8E,F), which showed a linear accumulation in both cycles.3.5. Multivariate AnalysisFigure 9 and Figure 10 show the results of the multivariate analysis for the 1st and 2nd cycles, respectively, where clearly the irrigation with MW separated from CW. In the 1st cycle, the principal component analysis applied to all the selected significant variables explained 62.3% of the total data variability (p < 0.1) (PC1 41.0% and PC2 21.3%) (Figure 9). In PC1, there was a separation of water type, where Zn and N explained the grouping of CW, and all the other variables explained the grouping for MW.Figure 9. Principal component analyses (PCA) for the 1st cycle of lettuce cultivation as a function of replacement rates (25; 50; 75; 100; and 125%—mean presented in the plot with n = 5) and two types of water (CW: Convention water; MW: Magnetic Water).

Following the same trend of the 1st cycle, for the 2nd cycle, there was a separation between CW and MW, where most of the variables explained the grouping for MW.4. DiscussionAs checked in the water chemical characterization, during the magnetic treatment, when water passes through the magnetic field, its structure and some physical characteristics are altered. According to Pang and Deng [47], these changes include optical properties, electromagnetism, thermodynamics, and mechanics. When the water is subjected to magnetization, changes in the dielectric constant, viscosity, force of surface tension, solidification point, boiling point, and electrical conductivity occur in comparison to these characteristics in pure, non-magnetic water [47]. Besides, the clustering structure of hydrogen-bonded chains and the polarization effects of water molecules is enhanced after magnetization. Other studies report that, in a magnetic field, an increase in the cluster size of liquid water may occur [48].Studies have shown that high-intensity magnetic fields (>0.2 T) cause an increase in the number of monomeric water molecules. However, at the same time, it increases the assembly of these molecules into tetramers (four molecules of water interacting with each other via hydrogen bonds) [49].Furthermore, the water coefficient of friction in thin films is reduced in a magnetic field, indicating a possible decrease in the strength of the hydrogen bonds. Salt mobility is reinforced in strong magnetic fields (1–10 T), causing some interruption of the hydrogen bonds [50].Based on the molecular changes in the structure of water during magnetization, Pang and Deng [47] described the theory of water magnetization according to the views of proton conductivity in the hydrogen bond systems of ice. When water is exposed to a magnetic field, the hydrogen bonds of the molecules approach each other, forming closed chains of hydrogen bonds. Therefore, the application of magnetism facilitates the conduction of the ‘molecular electric current’ due to the proton conductivity under the action of the Lorentz force of the magnetic field. Thus, the magnetic interactions of these ‘molecular electric current’ elements with each other or with the external magnetic field result in changes in the distribution and characteristics of the water molecules and, consequently, in their magnetization. Furthermore, the application of a magnetic field to water reduces its surface tension, causing an increase in the dissolution of water in minerals and providing adequate amounts of nutrients for plant growth [51].The effects of magnetically treated water in the irrigation of lettuce were evaluated in terms of water availability in the soil and nutrient uptake. Irrigation of lettuce with magnetically treated water showed a higher water tension in the soil when compared to conventional water. This result can be related to the action of the magnetic field, which causes a weakening in the matric tension, thus increasing the availability of water in the soil [14,25,26]. This is explained by the magnetization process, which influences the hydrogen bonds and Van der Waals forces, releasing ions and making the water structure more cohesive.This occurs when calcium (Ca+2) and carbonate (CO3−2) ions enter in the zone influenced by the magnets since they are pushed in opposite directions due to their charges. As a result, water molecules can be easily aggregated to the soil particles and, therefore, will not be leached. Water molecules will also be able to penetrate easily the micropores of the soil particles, which prevents the water molecules from moving to greater depths [25,26]. Hilal and Hilal [52] also noticed that the magnetic treatment could act in the soil/water ratio and destabilize the gas bubbles present in the soil, causing a change in ionic balance and improving nutrient availability.As a result of the crop development, from an enzymatic point of view, Surendran et al. and Maheshwari and Grewal [26,53] report that plants irrigated with magnetically treated water showed faster activation of enzymes and hormones during the growth process, which could have r', 'unique_identifier': 255}\n",

G. Allen, M. D. Dukes, R. L. Snyder, R. Kjelgren, A. Kilic HIGHLIGHTS • A multi-component decoupling method for the landscape coefficient is described that provides a thorough means to estimate water requirements of landscapes • The decoupling method considers differences in vegetation type, density, local climate, and soil water management.  • Methods for incorporating managed stress and frequency of irrigation are described. • Winter-time or dormant season ET is described. • The ASABE S623 procedure is described that represents a more simplified and reduced form from the multi-component procedure and is complementary.  Abstract. Water requirements of landscapes are highly variable due to the heterogeneous natures of landscapes, vegetation types, influence of buildings, and nutrient and water management. Objectives for water management of landscapes are for general appearance and health rather than for maximum biomass production. A multi-component method developed for the Irrigation Association (IA) Irrigation Sixth Edition and extended from the California WUCOLS procedure is demonstrated where the landscape coefficient (KL, equivalent to a crop coefficient) is broken down into the four components of a) vegetation type; b) vegetation density; c) microclimate; and d) managed stress. Each of these components can be    2  estimated using readily made descriptions of a landscaped area and management objectives. One form of the KL equation is used to determine target KL that incorporates a target amount of soil water stress to support water conservation and to support water planning studies. A second form of the KL equation can be used to estimate the actual KL occurring under actual water management. The second form is used in studies of water balances and actual water conservation. The general decoupled equation is further expanded to optionally incorporate impacts of evaporation from exposed soil to assess impacts of irrigation frequency on total water consumption. The mathematics for the approach can be incorporated into software applications and smart irrigation controllers to produce improved water consumption estimates for landscape water requirements for use in irrigation scheduling, water requirements planning and water depletion studies. The ASABE S623 simplified procedure for estimating a landscape water requirement that is complementary to the IA procedure is discussed and compared. Both methods utilize a vegetation type and density system as the basis for efficiently estimating scientifically accurate landscape water requirements. Keywords.Keywords.Keywords.Keywords.

INTRODUCTION  Water requirements and consumption by residential and urban landscapes have become increasingly important because of the quantity and value of water consumed. Procedures, which are similar to agriculture, are adapted to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) from landscapes. Two distinctions are made between agriculture and landscapes: 1) landscape systems often comprise mixtures of types and species of vegetation, and non-uniform spatial configurations, thereby complicating the estimation of ET, and 2) typically, the objective of landscape irrigation is to promote appearance rather than biomass production, whereas biomass production is generally maximized in agriculture.     3  Target ET for landscapes may incorporate intentional water stress into the baseline estimate for ET, because landscape plants are often deficit irrigated to reduce water applications without substantially reducing health or appearance. Many landscape plants can often be stressed to some degree without adverse effects. This adjustment can produce considerable water conservation, and a better defined estimate for water requirements of landscapes may reduce over-irrigation of landscapes that often occurs due to their relatively small size. Controlled stress can also reduce unneeded excessive growth, which reduces volumes of lawn and tree clippings. . The magnitude of any managed stress in a landscape depends on physiological and morphological requirements of the plants; the goal is to sustain health and appearance with minimal irrigation. For example, water conservation studies on turfgrass have demonstrated water savings of 20 to 30% for cool-season turfgrasses and 40% for warm-season turfgrasses without significant loss of quality (Meyer and Gibeault 1986, Pittenger and Shaw 2001, 2004). Some shrubs and groundcovers can be managed for even more stress-induced reduction in ET (Kjelgren et al. 2000, 2016).  A third departure of landscape ET from agricultural ET is that few landscape sites meet the “extensive surface” requirement needed to ensure equilibrium between the lower boundary layer of the atmosphere and the vegetation that is implied in the Penman-Monteith equation. Therefore impacts of local microclimates may need to be considered in the ET estimate. The non-uniform boundary-layer equilibrium can be at the leaf level where stomates more directly regulate transpiration (Jarvis and McNaughton, 1986), such as for large specimen or street trees.  Therefore, compensating adjustments are necessary to the landscape coefficient in the form of a microclimate factor to account for effects of local surroundings. TARGET ET AND ACTUAL ET  Because of the frequent inclusion of water stress in target ET values for landscape design and management, distinction must be made between target ET values and actual ET values. Actual ET values    4  may exceed target ET values if the landscape receives more water than required by the target that includes intentional stress. Under these conditions, landscape vegetation may exploit the additional available water, subject to some limit constrained by environmental energy available for evaporation and leaf area. The upper environmental energy limit, which follows behavior and principles used for agricultural crops, may exceed the targeted ET rate. Conversely, actual ET may be less than targeted ET values if stress levels to the landscape are more excessive than targeted. Therefore, two ET values for landscape are distinguished here. The first is the target landscape ET, referred to as ETL, that is based on minimum ET levels, relative to climate, necessary to sustain a healthy, attractive landscape. The target landscape ET is useful for irrigation scheduling and water conservation planning. The second ET value is the actual landscape ET, ETL act, that is based on landscape type and on actual water availability, which may be greater or less than water required to establish and support target landscape ETL. The actual landscape ET is useful for water depletion studies and for hydrologic water balances. The decoupled methodology for the landscape coefficient is relatively straightforward to code into application software so that only the selection or specification of four readily described coefficients is required. Traditionally, landscape ET estimation is based on the standardized reference ET for short canopies (ETo) rather than reference ET for tall canopies (ETr) due to similarity between ETo and turf grass ET. The ETo concept and derivation of ETo is presented in ASCE (2005) and in ASCE 2016). The target ET for a landscape is calculated as  oLLET = K ET (1) where ETL is the target landscape ET (in mm d-1, mm month-1, or mm year-1), and ETo is the ET of a 0.12 m tall, cool-season grass in the same units. KL is the target landscape coefficient, which is similar to the crop coefficient (Kc) used in agricultural applications.     5  SCOPE OF THIS PAPER A decoupled approach for estimating KL described in this paper was formulated by Costello et al. (2000) in California and termed WUCOLS (water use classification of landscape species) (Costello and Jones 1999; 2014) and Irrigation Association (2003). The method was modified for use with the Landscape Irrigation Management Program (LIMP) by Snyder and Eching (2004, 2005) and Snyder et al. (2015). The decoupling method separates actual landscape ET into components for well-watered vegetation that are then adjusted by a deficit irrigation coefficient. Allen et al., (2011) and ASCE (2016) extended the decoupling procedure to enable the estimation of effects of watering frequency on landscape ET and estimation of target soil water depletion to meet water stress targets. The decoupling approach provides a relatively simple means to break the KL into four terms that describe separate mechanisms impacting landscape ET. Each mechanism describes a factor involved in the landscape ET process that can be readily described by a user. The terms can be extracted from general, simplified tables or can be obtained from more rigorous, mechanical methods in the case of the managed stress coefficient and density coefficient. In addition, the ASABE S623 procedure for water requirement recommendations (ASABE Standards, 2017) that is complementary to the IA decoupled procedure, but that is more simplified and aggregated, is discussed and compared. Both methods utilize a vegetation type and density system as the basis for efficiently estimating scientifically accurate landscape water requirements. BACKGROUND ON K L AND K C.  The vegetation cover or “crop” coefficient (Kc) that has a basis of reference crop ET (ETref) was clarified in Jensen (1968) and first used in computerized irrigation scheduling by Jensen (1969) and Jensen et al. (1970, 1971). The procedures for estimating ET for well-watered agricultural crops that employ a Kc and ETref procedure can be applied to wide range of landscape, natural and agricultural vegetation under rainfed and irrigated conditions.    6  Early, refined Kc values were developed based on daily ET measured in lysimeters that were then related to a grass or alfalfa reference ET. Some Kc values were refined for conditions of dry surface soil and were termed basal crop coefficients (Wright 1982). Accuracies of ET estimates made with a dual Kc approach where basal coefficients are adjusted daily according to wetness of the surface soil following rain or irrigation are generally greater than accuracy of ET estimates made using a single lumped Kc value (Wright 1982; Allen et al. 1998). Somewhat limited experimental research exists on quantifying water needs and KL for the vast and diverse array of landscape plant types (Pittenger and Henry 2005). Some of the leading work on landscape ET and KL for groundcovers and shrubs has been done in California, where water applied to landscapes in southern California is estimated to be 25 to 30% of all water used in the region (Pittenger and Shaw 2001; Reid and Oki 2008; 2016; Reid et al. 2018). St. Hilaire et al. (2008) produced a table of KL values for 35 landscape groundcovers and shrubs that are targeted to provide acceptable landscape performance after initial establishment and that induce a managed amount of water stress associated with deficit irrigation strategies.  LIMITATIONS ON MAGNITUDES OF LANDSCAPE COEFFICIENTS When applying a grass reference ET equation (ASCE 2005, 2016) under humid conditions, where a majority of energy for the ET process is from net radiation, the maximum KL or Kc for large expanses of similar vegetation does not exceed about 1.2 relative to ETo, whereas in arid or semiarid climates, where additional advection of warm dry air can occur, increasing ET from irrigated surfaces, the KL or Kc can reach maximum values of about 1.3 to 1.4 relative to the grass reference (Doorenbos and Pruitt 1977; Allen et al., 1998; ASCE 2005). Limiting KL to approximately 1.3 or 1.4 for a grass reference base generally applies to large expanses of vegetation (>50 to 100 m in the direction of wind (Allen et al., 1998)).    7  When ET is measured from small expanses of vegetation, the internal boundary layer above the vegetation may not be in equilibrium with the underlying surface, particularly with well ventilated, tall trees (ASCE 2016). Small expanses of tall vegetation surrounded by shorter cover can result in a “clothesline effect” where the interchange between air and vegetation is much more efficient than over large expanses of homogeneous vegetation. In these cases, ET from isolated vegetation stands, on a per unit area basis, may be significantly greater than the corresponding ETo computed for a grass reference, depending on stomatal behavior. An example of these situations is ET from a single row of trees surrounded by short vegetation or even ET from a small area of grass or flowers surrounded by a dry, vegetation-free surface. Allen et al. (1992) reported Kc values for small (6 m wide) stands of cattails and bulrushes surrounded by grass pasture equal to 1.6 to 1.8 during midseason, relative to an alfalfa reference. These measurements indicate a strong clothesline effect. An extreme illustration was by van Bavel et al. (1963), who measured ET from 1 m tall sudangrass in Arizona following cutting of the grass around a lysimeter, so that the vegetation inside the lysimeter functioned as a clothesline. After cutting, 14.7 mm of ET during a 24 h period was measured compared with 9.8 mm three days before the cutting—a 50% increase. The weather data were similar for both clear days. In a similar situation, Allen et al. (1991) measured ET from 0.6 m fescue grass that increased by 1.6 times relative to the PM equation when the surrounding grass was clipped to 0.1 m, but the vegetation inside the lysimeter remained at 0.6 m. The ET rate from the lysimeter under the clothesline condition reached 16 mm d-1, whereas the PM equation estimated 11 mm d-1 for 0.6 m grass having extensive fetch of other 0.6 m grass.  Pruitt (personal communication, 1976) reported Kc values for a nearly isolated 4.2 m tall Monterey pine tree (Pinus radiata) varying from 1.4 in February-March to 2.0 during spring and summer and to 3.0 during late fall and dry, early-winter months relative to ETo. The tree grew on a 1.83 m by 2.44 m hydraulic-pillow lysimeter located within a 1 ha dry, fallow field, thereby creating a clothesline effect.    8  The preceding discussion indicates the importance of knowing the type of setting for which ET estimates are needed. If ET estimates are to represent large expanses of similar vegetation or small stands of vegetation surrounded by mixtures of other vegetation having similar roughness and soil water conditions, then KL values will generally be less than or equal to 1.3 for grass references.  ET of Heterogeneous or Integrated Landscapes ET and KL for mixed landscapes is needed for irrigation management. In many landscapes, elevated ET from tall, narrow stands of vegetation as described in the previous section can reduce ET from adjacent shorter vegetation due to shading, blocking of wind and, to some extent, by cooling and humidifying the air. Therefore, development of an integrated and blended estimate for ETL and KL for a landscape should be based on a composite view of the landscape that considers the mixture of vegetation types and heights, even though water requirements for tall, narrow stands of vegetation, such as trees, may be greater or less depending on stomatal behavior. Also to be considered in developing an integrated KL is the impact of horizontal extents of tree roots that tend to be larger than canopy extents and therefore can even out water extraction over parts of a landscape and that tend to integrate KL of individual vegetation. DEVELOPMENT OF THE LANDSCAPE COEFFICIENT (KL) The primary factor causing an increase in the landscape coefficient is an increase in plant cover or leaf-area per unit area (LAI) as vegetation develops, resulting in a decrease in bulk surface resistance and an increase in radiative capture and aerodynamic exchange. Most publications on crop coefficients (Kc) have presented Kc as a time-based function of some form of absolute or scaled time basis, such as the FAO-style example shown in Fig. 1. Other studies relate the rate of development of Kc for various crops as a function of daily weather such as cumulative growing degree days (Snyder 1985; Ritchie and NeSmith 1991; Slack et al. 1996; Snyder et al. 1999; Cesaraccio et al. 2001).     9    Figure 1. FAO-style crop coefficient curve and stage labeling.  The FAO-style KL function shown in terms of an equivalent Kc in Fig. 1 can be used to represent most landscape vegetation that has an annual cycle of low vegetation cover or vigor during wintertime, with regrowth or return of vigor during spring. During periods of low cover or vigor, the KL or Kc can be as low as 0.1 to 0.3 when averaged over the period termed in Fig. 1 as “initial.” The KL will reach a maximum or near-maximum value during the “mid-season” period when ground cover is maximum. In the case of year-round vegetation in warm climates, the KL may remain at or near the midseason KL value. Values for KL ini and KL end (i.e., Kc ini and Kc end in Fig. 1) can be scaled from KL mid (i.e., Kc mid in Fig. 1) in proportion to the health and leaf condition of the vegetation at termination and the length of the late season period (i.e., whether leaves senesce slowly or are killed by frost). A DECOUPLING APPROACH FOR K L The above discussion describes the potentially wide range in values for KL that can be caused by the surroundings of vegetation and/or dryness of the surrounding environment. KL can also have broad ranges CropDev.InitialPeriodPeriodPeriodPeriodMid SeasonLateSeasonTime of Season, daysKc0.20.40.60.81.01.20.0Kc iniKc midK c end   10  in values due to variation in density of vegetation. As a result, Costello et al. (2000) developed and described the procedure from California termed WUCOLS (water use classification of landscape species), where the KL was decoupled into reproducible and visually apparent components representing the effects of four factors that determine the value for KL. The decoupling was done to facilitate application to the wide diversity of vegetation types and environments of landscape systems. Snyder and Eching (2004, 2005) and Snyder et al. (2015) proposed a similar decoupled procedure for estimating a formulated KL that uses different ranges for the KL components than does Costello et al. (2000), where the ranges for the Kd and Ksm factors are normalized to limit their ranges to 0 - 1.0. Snyder and Eching (2004) and Snyder et al. (2015) modified the WUCOLS procedure in the Landscape irrigation management program (LIMP) to the form:  mcsmdvLKK K KK= (2) where Kv is a vegetation species factor (0.7 – 1.2), Kd is a vegetation density factor (0 – 1.0), Kmc is a microclimate factor (0.5 – 1.5), and Ksm is a managed stress factor (0 – 1.0). Kv is the ratio of ETv to ETo for a specific single or mixture of plant species under full soil water supply, and where ETv is the vegetation ET assuming no water deficits and essentially full ground cover, defined by Snyder and Eching (2004) and Snyder et al. (2015) as having more than 70 to 80% of the ground covered or shaded by vegetation. Kv therefore represents the maximum KL expected for vegetation or for a mixture of vegetation under no soil water stress and where there are no microclimate adjustments required. Factors Kd, Ksm, and Kmc modify Kv for less than effective full ground cover (Kd), for intentional water stress (Ksm), and for micro-climate differences due to shading, light reflection from structures, fetch and wind exposure, and slope and aspect impacts on radiation (Kmc). Each of these factors can be estimated separate from the others based on visual observation of the landscape (for Kd and Kmc) and based on user experience for Ksm (Reid and Oki 2008; 2016; Reid et al. 2018).     11  Following the estimation of the individual factors, KL is calculated using Eq. (2) to produce a landscape-specific estimate of relative landscape ET. The landscape-specific KL can improve water conservation efforts by better matching irrigation additions to landscape-specific conditions including a targeted soil water stress level. The form of the KL equation in Eq. (2) is used to determine target KL that may include a targeted amount of soil water stress to support water conservation and to support water planning studies. A second form of the KL equation provided later as Eq. (17) can be used to estimate the actual KL occurring under actual water management. The second form is used in studies of water balances and actual water conservation where the actual ET from the landscape is needed.  An alternative form of Eq. (2) from Irrigation Association (2011) adds the variable effects of evaporation from soil in between vegetation that may be significant during frequent wetting by rainfall or irrigation and is patterned after the dual Kc procedure of FAO56 (Allen et al. 1998):   = 1 − soil +  (3) where Ksoil is the evaporation coefficient representing evaporation from the soil surface (relative to ETo) caused by wetting by precipitation or irrigation. Ksoil is included in Eq. (3) to consider the impact of evaporation occurring between plants. In the context of Eq. (3), the Kv coefficient represents the, potential transpiration from the vegetation component when the soil surface is infrequently wetted and mostly dry, so that evaporation from soil is treated separately by Ksoil. The impact of Ksoil is strongest when plant density (Kd) is low and frequency of soil wetting is high. Ksoil is less impactful with greater plant density or greater Kv. Ksoil is estimated as a function of soil wetting frequency and magnitude of ETo from Fig. 2 originating from Fig. 29 of FAO-56 (Allen et al., 1998). Ksoil can also be estimated using equations from ASCE (2016) and in Allen et al., (1998; 2005), where Ksoil is referred to as Ke or Kini for bare soil conditions.    12   Figure 2. Average Ksoil for a bare soil surface as related to the level of grass reference ETo and the interval between irrigations or significant rain (a) all soil types when wetting events are about 10 mm per event, (b) coarse-textured soils when wetting events are greater than about 40 mm, and (c) medium and fine-textured soils when wetting events are greater than about 40 mm (after FAO-56 - Allen et al., (1998)).   Eq. (3) reverts to Eq. (2) when Ksoil = 0. However, in that case, the Kv should include impacts of evaporation from soil. Eq. (3) is useful to assess the impact of irrigation frequency on total ET of a landscape having 01234567891011120.00.20.40.60.81.01.2Kc iniET  mm/dayo1 day2 day4 day7 day10 day20 daysmall infiltration depths~ 10 mm low moderate high very high Ksoila. all soils01234567891011120.00.20.40.60.81.01.2Kc iniET  mm/dayo1 day2 day4 day7 day10 day20 daysmall infiltration depths~ 10 mm low moderate high very high Ksoil01234567891011120.00.20.40.60.81.01.2Kc iniET  mm/dayo1 day2 day4 day7 day10 day20 daysmall infiltration depths~ 10 mm low moderate high very high Ksoila. all soils01234567891011120.00.20.40.60.81.01.2Kc iniET  mm/dayo1 day2 day4 day7 day10 day20 daylarge infiltration depths> 40 mm low moderate high very high a.  coarse texturesKsoilb. coarse textures01234567891011120.00.20.40.60.81.01.2Kc iniET  mm/dayo1 day2 day4 day7 day10 day20 daylarge infiltration depths> 40 mm low moderate high very high a.  coarse texturesKsoil01234567891011120.00.20.40.60.81.01.2Kc iniET  mm/dayo1 day2 day4 day7 day10 day20 daylarge infiltration depths> 40 mm low moderate high very high a.  coarse texturesKsoilb. coarse textures01234567891011120.00.20.40.60.81.01.2Kc iniET  mm/dayo1 day2 day4 day7 day10 day20 daylarge infiltration depths   > 40 mm low moderate high very high b.  fine and medium texturesKsoilc. fine and medium textures01234567891011120.00.20.40.60.81.01.2Kc iniET  mm/dayo1 day2 day4 day7 day10 day20 daylarge infiltration depths   > 40 mm low moderate high very high b.  fine and medium texturesKsoil01234567891011120.00.20.40.60.81.01.2Kc iniET  mm/dayo1 day2 day4 day7 day10 day20 daylarge infiltration depths   > 40 mm low moderate high very high b.  fine and medium texturesKsoilc. fine and medium textures   13  less than full ground cover. Effects of evaporation of water intercepted by vegetation following irrigation or precipitation are estimated with Eqs. (20 to 22) described later. Eq. (3) provides estimates for KL over an extended period of time where effects of evaporation from soil, over time, are averaged through the estimate for Ksoil.  More refined estimates, when needed, can be made using a daily water balance for the surface soil layer using the dual Kcb + Ksoil procedure described in Allen et al., (1998; 2005) and ASCE (2016), where the basal crop coefficient, Kcb, of the FAO procedure is set equal to a Kv that represents a relatively dry soil surface, and Ksoil is estimated daily in accordance with wetting frequency. Refined, daily estimates might be desirable during computer modeling for specific landscapes where the daily water balance and associated equations can be scripted into software code and where specific wetting frequency is known or can be estimated. Ordinarily, Eq. (3) will provide satisfactory and sufficient estimates for KL for purposes of irrigation scheduling, estimation of water conservation impacts and for general water depletion studies. Reference ETo as influenced by the microclimate Reference ETo, which represents weather-based effects on potential ET, is influenced by the microclimate of a landscape. A local environment that is surrounded by dry areas or by buildings and walk-ways are often subjected to more long-wave radiation and local advection of sensible heat compared to areas surrounded by vegetation due to the surrounding elevated surface temperatures. This can cause the potential demand for the area to exceed that for the standardized ETo that represents near maximum ET from an extensive surface of short grass. An altered reference ETo, termed ETo mc is defined as the ETo within the microclimate where the vegetation grows. Local ETo mc can deviate from the regional ETo that represents a regional estimate of reference evapotranspiration based on measured weather data from an open, vegetated area. Thus, ETo mc is a local ETo corrected for microclimate differences. The microclimate coefficient, Kmc = ETo mc/ETo, is estimated or determined experimentally and is described in a following    14  section. The Vegetation Coefficient The Kv for landscape vegetation represents the ratio of ETv to ETo mc that occurs when generally 70% or more cover (shading) of the ground exists and the soil water supply is full. ETo mc is used as the basis for Kv because the ETv represents the ET for the vegetation in the same microclimate as represented by ETo mc. In contrast, the Kv is expected to have a relatively constant and consistent value over ranges in microclimate because both ETv and ETo mc are impacted by the same microclimatic factors. As a result, Kv defines the maximum ratio KL = ETv/ETo mc for vegetation under non-deficit irrigation conditions. The Kv is the fraction of ETo mc when the foliage has Kd = 1.00 and full water availability (Ksm = 1.00). Many types of landscape vegetation tend to exhibit similar values for Kv due to similarities in total leaf area, stomatal response, and energy absorption. Therefore, condensed tables of typical values for general species types are employed to provide general estimates for Kv, where Kv typically ranges from 0.8 to 1.2.  Because landscape vegetation is commonly taller and rougher than turf grass, the upper limit for Kv can exceed 1.00 for well-watered landscapes. Table 1 contains general values for Kv for general types of landscape vegetation. Primary sources for values in Table 1 are listed in the table footnote. Table 1. General vegetation factors, Kv, for general plant types for high density cover of the ground and full water supply (Irrigation Association (2011); ASCE (2016)).  Vegetation Category[1] Kv Trees 1.15 Shrubs —desert species 0.70 —non-desert 0.80 Groundcover 1.00 Annuals (flowers) 0.90 Mixture of trees, shrubs, and groundcover[2] 1.20 Cool season turfgrass[3] 0.90 Warm season turfgrass[4] 0.90 [1] The tree, shrub, and groundcover categories listed are for landscapes composed solely or predominantly of one of these vegetation types with somewhat dense coverage (shading) of the ground. [2] Mixed plantings are composed of two or three vegetation types (i.e., where a single vegetation type does not dominate). [3] Cool season grasses include Kentucky blue grass, fescues, and perennial ryegrass    15  [4] Warm season grasses include Bermuda grass, St. Augustine grass, buffalo grass, and blue grama  Primary sources of data include cool season turfgrass (Aronson et al. 1987; Brown et al. 2001); warm season turfgrass (Brown et al. 2001; Jia et al. 2009); other vegetation (Irrigation Association 2011). The Kv value for warm season grass is a maximum expected value under full water supply.  In practice, KL for grass is lowered by inducing some degree of stress so that Ksm in Eq. (2) and (3) is less than one, for example Ksm = 0.7.  The typical Kv values in Table 1 represent full effective ground cover where the fraction of the surface covered by vegetation, fc, is greater than about 0.70 and for no water deficit conditions. The Kv values in Table 1 are general, assume that Kd = 1.00, and assume no ET reducing water stress, so Ksm=1.00. The Kv values apply for the full range of microclimate factor Kmc. The soil factor Ksm is less than 1.00 when the landscape is deficit irrigated (Brown et al. 2001; Jia et al. 2009). The Kv value for trees applies most readily to species adapted to abundant soil water, such as Populus and other riparian species, while many other tree species may fall closer to the Kv of shrubs. More information is given in Kjelgren et al., (2016) and in the WUCOLS literature cited earlier.  The Kv values for both cool season (CS) and warm season (WS) grasses are less than 1.00 in Table 1 due to the tendency for their mean height to be less than that of the standardized 0.12 m clipped grass reference. Differences in water use rates have been noted between cultivars of CS and WS grasses (Harivandi et al., 2009), so that values in Table 1 represent averages for typical cultivars. The Kv value for WS grass in Table 1 is equal to that for CS grass because both of these grass types tend to have similar ETv/ETo mc when under conditions of no water stress (Brown et al., 2001; Smeal et al. 2005). Warm-season grasses utilize C4 photosynthesis mechanisms as compared to C3 mechanisms for cool-season grasses (Qi and Redmann 1993; Way et al., 2014). As a result, WS grasses tend to have more effective stomatal control and survive water stress better than CS grasses due to their physiology and superior drought avoidance and drought resistance mechanisms (Harivandi et al., 2009, Way et al., 2014). As a consequence, it is not necessary to irrigate WS grasses as much as CS grasses. Also, WS grasses are more heat tolerant, so they can warm more than CS grasses without adverse effects to photosynthesis or growth. However, if WS and    16  CS grasses are irrigated frequently, ET rates between CS and WS grasses will be comparable, but frequent irrigation is not necessarily a good practice.  Users are encouraged to manage irrigation of WS grasses where a managed stress factor of about 0.7 is targeted (Harivandi et al., 2009) so that, given Kd = 1.00 and Kmc = 1.00, the KL from Eq. (2) is 0.90 (1.00) (0.70) (1.00) = 0.63. In other words, some level of stress can be applied to WS grasses with little visual effect, as is illustrated later in Table 3. The Kv value for WS grass is listed as 0.90 in Table 1 to provide for best accuracy when calculating ETL in water balances for hydrology and water conservation studies, where Ksm may have a value of 1.00 during times of frequent rainfall and therefore a WS grass may transpire similarly to a CS grass during well-watered periods. Comparison of KL for WS grasses from Eq. (2) and Tables 1–3 with measurements in a Florida application are presented in Fig. 4 that shows KL for WS grass close to 0.60 during summer when water stress occurs.

Modelling of water content and the transport of water in soil has become a useful tool in simulating agricultural productivity or in solving various hydrological analyses. For instance, optimum irrigation management requires a systematic estimation of the soil-moisture to determine both the appropriate amount and timing of irrigation. Soil characteristics appear as an essential input in the numerical simulation of a soil-water regime. A critical physical property used in the description of a soil-water regime in such modelling is a soil water retention curve. This paper aims to evaluate so-called pedotransfer functions, which helps to assess the soil water retention curve easier than by standard complex and lengthy procedure involving both field and laboratory work. As a case study Zahorska Lowland, which is located in central Europe in the western part of Slovakia, was selected. The frequent occurrence of dry years in this area results in the necessity to construct irrigation systems in this area, so modelling water content in the soil is an important task here. This study aims to support such modelling with determining pedotransfer functions. Authors compare linear methods (multiple linear regression, LASSO regularized regression) and CatBoost machine learning model. 1.  Introduction When solving various ecological and agricultural tasks in the landscape, one of the main variables that determine the properties and processes of the environment is soil moisture [1]. Modelling of this variable is used as an essential tool in, e.g., land drought management [2]. Some variables for modelling the climatic and soil characteristics of the landscape are relatively easy to obtain. For example, precipitations, temperatures, or evapotranspiration (which can be derived from the previous two) are almost always available. But, it is usually much more difficult to describe the characteristics of the heterogeneous soil environment of the landscape in such modelling. An essential characteristic or input of models used in the description of a soil-water regime is a soil water retention curve. It describes the relationship between the water content and the water potential of the soil. This dependence can be determined by measurements and laboratory, which is, however, relatively time-consuming. Even more challenging is to evaluate this characteristic by measuring for a larger area. For this reason, the concept of so-called pedotransfer functions (PTFs) was created, which simplifies/eliminate the mentioned laboratory procedure [3]. This paper deals with the point estimation of pedotransfer functions. Point estimation methods follow an approach of estimating water content at predetermined pressure heads. PTFs indicate the dependence of the soil water content by using the easy available soil characteristics, e.g., the soil particle sizes in the soil or the dry bulk density of the soil. These data are very often already available in various geographic information systems. Soil water retention curve can 6th World Multidisciplinary Earth Sciences SymposiumIOP Conf.

In this paper, linear and machine learning methods were used to estimate a drying branch of a water retention curve by using concept of pedotransfer functions. Proposed methods are tested on the Zahorska lowland in the Slovak Republic. Presented computations show the superiority of machine learning methods over linear methods which is the main results obtained in this study. In the next part of the paper (“Case Study and Data Description”), the acquisition and preparation of the data is described. The methods applied in this study are then briefly explained. In the “Results and Discussion” section, the computational experiments are described, as well the results are evaluated and discussed. Finally, the “Conclusion” part of the paper summarizes the main achievements of the work. 2.  Case Study and Data Description The area of interest – the Zahorska Lowland, is located in central Europe, in the western part of the Slovak Republic. It is bounded by the river Morava, and the Little Carpathians mountain. Most of the Zahorska Lowland territory is covered by clayed sands, drift sands and sandy clays [4]. The main pedogenetic factors of these lowlands are the accumulation activity of streams, soil-disrupting floods and soil erosion. The most widespread soils in this area are Chernozems, Arenosols, and fluvial soils on the river Morava’s fluvial plains. Their profile is continuously loaded with layers of flood sediment sludge [5]. The spatial distribution of the different types of soil is shown in Figure 1 according to the USDA classification.   Figure 1.The spatial distribution of the Zahorska Lowland soil types according to the USDA classification The soil samples which are used in this study for evaluation of PTFs were air-dried and sieved; soil particle distribution and other analyses were performed as well. After these analyses were accomplished, the data set contained the following parameters: four grain categories according to the Kopecky textural classification (which is used in Slovakia), reduced bulk density ρd, and the points of the drying branches of the water retention curve (WRC) for the pressure head values of -2.5, -56, -209, -558, -976, -3060 and -15,300 cm. The last variables were estimated using overpressure equipment. 6th World Multidisciplinary Earth Sciences SymposiumIOP Conf.

Methods The main goal of this work is to compare the existing regression methods for estimating of PTFs with new ones, proposed in this paper, and to choose the method, which is most suitable input for subsequent modelling of soil moisture. The standard method used for estimating PTFs is multiple linear regression. Multiple linear regression (MLR) search for the relevant coefficients in the equation of the linear model. In general, it can be written as follows: 𝑌 = 𝑎𝑋1 + 𝑏𝑋2 + 𝑐𝑋3 + ⋯ + 𝑋𝑛, (1) where Y denotes a dependent variable, Xn are independent variables. In linear regression, independent variables should not correlate too much. To remove multicollinearity in given problem, the Least Absolute Selection and Shrinkage Operator (LASSO) was used for the regularization of the linear regression. It was introduced in 1996 by R. Tibshirani [6] In a LASSO regularization, some coefficients are zeroed. Using this regularization, a simpler model is created, and a better generalization is provided.  As a representative of nonlinear machine learning models the CatBoost model [7] was chosen. Gradient boosting is a powerful machine-learning technique that achieves state-of-the-art results in a variety of practical tasks: web search, environmental variable predictions, spatial analysis of ecological factors distribution, such as distribution of contaminant concentration, weather forecasting, and many others [8, 9, 10].CatBoost is a machine learning algorithm that uses gradient boosting on regression trees [11] which builds a model in a stage-wise fashion, through increasingly refined approximations. Gradient boosting evaluates the precision of a model in a previous stage. It then develops the next model, which computes the differences between the current results computed and the known target values (i.e., not the original target values). Such \"boosting\" continues until the desired level of accuracy is reached. A fundamental building block in CatBoost is a regression tree – a type of tree in which decision node contains a test on some input variable\\'s value, and the terminal nodes of the tree contain the predicted values. The cost for using CatBoost (compared, e.g., with a LASSO algorithm) is that CatBoost has more parameters to tune. In this work, the cross-validation method was used to find the parameters of this model. A description of the parameters and various recommendations for setting them can be found at CatBoost website [12]. 4.  Results and Discussion For comparison, we firstly calculated points of PTFs using the standard method - multiple linear regression. Results obtained were statistically evaluated, so it will be possible to show whether the proposed methods described later in this chapter works better. A multi-linear regression for assessing the PTFs was used in the form: 𝜃ℎ𝑤 =  𝑎 ∗ 1𝑠𝑡 𝑐𝑎𝑡. + 𝑏 ∗ 2𝑛𝑑 𝑐𝑎𝑡. + 𝑐 ∗ 4𝑡ℎ 𝑐𝑎𝑡. + 𝑑 ∗ 𝜌𝑑 + 𝑒, (2) where θhw is the water content [cm3.cm-3] for the particular pressure head value hw [cm]; 1st cat., 2nd cat., and 4th cat. are the percentages of the clay (d< 0.01 mm), silt (0.01–0.05 mm), and sand (0.1–2.0 mm); d is the dry bulk density [g.cm-3]; and a, b, c, d, e, are the parameters determined by the regression analysis. Fine sand (3rd cat.) was not included in regression equation because of avoiding correlation between independent variables. The PTFs designed were from now on always evaluated on a testing dataset, which consisted of 50 soil samples. These samples were randomly selected from 180 samples that were measured at Zahorska Lowlands. Test samples were not used during models creation. The results of the multiple linear regression are listed in Table 1. The Coefficients of Determination (R2) for each of the pressure head values shows less degree of the relationship between the dependent and independent variables in some cases (with the smallest value of 0.671). This is why the authors tried to propose better regression methods for this task. 6th World Multidisciplinary Earth Sciences SymposiumIOP Conf.

The precision of the modelling using this method was enhanced by using the variable’s interaction within the input data. Regarding the degree of interactions, the interaction of the three variables was used. The interaction was included by introducing new variables that are arithmetic products of the original variables. If we potentially consider all the possible products of three variables, many new combined variables were created. For this reason, the regularization by LASSO was very useful, which, as described in the methodological part, reduces the number of variables in the resulting model. This selection and reduction of a number of variables should ensure the accuracy and stability of the resulting model. This premise is tested in Table 2, which evaluates the model for calculating the water content for the pressure head value hw of 1 cm. This table shows the usefulness of using variable interactions - as the table shows with the inclusion of interactions, the accuracy of the calculation increases (coefficient of determination (R2) increases, RMSE and percentage bias (PBIAS%) decrease).  The models for the water content in the soil at all pressures (1, 60, 200, 560, 1000, 3000, 15300 cm hw) are because of this finding assessed using only a triple interaction and are evaluated in Table 3. The results of the models in Table 3 can be compared with Table 1, where the basic linear regression was used. In the column for Coefficient of Determination (R) we see a higher, i.e., better value for all pressures hw, which proves that LASSO is a more suitable model for calculating the points of the retention curve. The functions from the R package glmnet were used for computation of the LASSO model [13]. The lambda regularisation parameter was optimized by cross validation, and its value is shown in the tables with results of modelling. An example of tuning this parameter for LASSO regression with a triple interaction of the explanatory variables is given in Figure 2.  Table 2.

The following parameters have been tuned by cross-validation: 1) number of regression trees; 2) learning rate and 3) random subspace method (rsm) - the percentage of features to use at each regression tree split selection. This algorithm is known for its good default settings, so for other parameters, default settings have been used. An example of tuning these parameters is given in Figure 3. Point models for the water content in the soil at pressures 1, 60, 200, 560, 1000, 3000 and 15300 cm hw are evaluated in Table 3. The CatBoost show better results even though interactions were not used, because interactions are already included in algorithm itself, which is based on regression trees.

Conclusions The paper contains a description and evaluation of the models for the development of pedotransfer functions for the point estimation of the soil-water content for the seven pressure head values hw from the basic soil properties (particle-size distribution, bulk density). Linear and machine learning model were compared with a standard multiple linear regression methodology. The accuracy of the predictions was evaluated by the Coefficient of Determination (R2) between the measured and predicted values. For the multiple linear regression and the various pressure heads the R2 varied from 0.671 to 0.740, from 0.709 to 0.820 when using LASSO, and from 0.731 to 0.846 for the CatBoost.  The results show the suitability of the proposed methods, while the CatBoost method can be considered as the most suitable method from the point of view of its accuracy. Nevertheless, innovative linear methods (with LASSO regularization), in applying of which authors also used the interaction of variables, offers comparable results. Advantage of these methods is that LASSO is more comfortable to handle than the compared machine learning model.

In this review, we describe the principles of several \\ncurrently commercially available sensors that can be adapted to this purpose, giving advantages and disadvantages of each \\ntype. We conclude that a sensor-based irrigation system has great potential to address the challenges associated with irrigation \\nscheduling, while improving water usage in most nurseries.\\nKeywords: automation, porous substrates, seedlings, small-volume container, timer system\\nINTRODUCTION\\nIrrigation water is becoming increasingly scarce in South \\nAfrica, with the agricultural industry using approximately \\n62% of available fresh water (Pimentel et al., 2004; Fanadzo \\nand Ncube, 2017). Ever-increasing demand for this limited \\nresource for household and industrial use, as well as \\nrecent droughts, has resulted in an urgent need for water \\nconservation (Gleeson et al., 2012). Thus, in commercial \\nnurseries which support the agricultural and forestry sectors, \\nit is becoming increasingly important to develop efficient \\nirrigation systems. Improved irrigation practices by nurseries \\ncan save water and reduce the costs of irrigation, and have \\nthe potential to improve seedling quality, reduce leaching of \\nnutrients, and lower the incidence of pathogen infestation \\n(Belayneh et al., 2013; Lichtenberg et al., 2013; Bayer et al., \\n2015; Saavoss et al., 2016; Lea-Cox et al., 2017; Wheeler et \\nal., 2017). Many biological and biophysical processes, such \\nas seed germination, seedling nutrition and growth, as well \\nas transpiration and evaporative cooling, are dependent \\non sufficient moisture via efficient irrigation (Bittelli, 2010; \\n2011). In most commercial nurseries, seedlings are grown \\nin containers with small-volume cavities ranging from 25 to \\n100 mL (examples of some forestry seedling containers are \\nshown in Fig. 1; Durner, 2013). This optimises the utilisation \\nof nursery and transportation space while ensuring the best \\nperformance when planted in the field. In such containers, \\nplant roots have a limited substrate volume to explore for \\nwater. Although space saving, one of the difficulties with \\nthese containers is that the substrate water status can range \\nfrom near-saturation immediately after irrigation, to near-\\ndryness after several hours without irrigation (Van Iersel \\net al., 2011; Montesano et al., 2016; Lea-Cox et al., 2017). \\nIrrigation scheduling for these containers should, therefore, \\naim at maintaining the media water content at levels that \\nminimise seedling water stress and maximise irrigation \\nefficiency during periods that require stress-free growth (Van \\nIersel et al., 2011).\\nCommercial nurseries generally irrigate their seedlings \\nbased on the visual appearance of the substrate (wet or \\ndry), their intuition and experience (growers may pick up \\nthe container to feel its relative ‘weight’), and often rely on \\na fixed timer-based system (Jones, 2004; 2008; Lea-Cox \\net al., 2011; 2017). Although the settings of a timer-based \\nsystem can be adjusted, it is set to irrigate according to a \\npredetermined schedule to apply water at a particular time \\nof day and for a particular duration (Nemali and Van Iersel, \\n2006; Montesano et al., 2016). Such timer-based systems have \\nbeen widely adopted due to their ease of use, relatively low \\ncost, ease of programming and success in irrigating correctly \\nwhen managed closely during periods of peak water demand \\n(Nemali et al., 2007; Lea-Cox, 2012). However, they can be \\nineffective and inefficient since water requirements may vary \\nby species, season, microclimate and changes in root density \\nor leaf area as the plant grows (Lea-Cox, 2012). For example, \\nsuch systems can waste water on cooler and cloudy days due \\nto fixed irrigation schedules which operate irrespective of \\nweather changes (Van Iersel et al., 2011). In addition, most \\nnursery managers are risk averse, preferring to apply excess \\nwater to ensure against system failure or heterogeneity of \\napplication (Jones, 2004; 2008). However, with increasing \\nwater costs and restrictions, it is becoming more necessary \\nto limit excessive water application. Therefore, scheduling \\nirrigation under fixed timer-based systems may be inaccurate \\nand costly and, considering these issues, there is a need for a \\nmore efficient method. \\nThe use of soil water sensors to control automated \\nirrigation systems is proposed as a useful alternative. \\nHowever, sensor-based irrigation systems are not widely used \\nin South African nurseries. This may be due to perceived \\n(i) high start-up costs, too expensive to adopt on a large \\n*Corresponding author, email: nkosinathi.kaptein@icfr.ukzn.ac.za\\nReceived 20 November 2017; accepted in revised form 26 June 2019\\nhttps://doi.org/10.17159/wsa/2019.v45.i3.6750\\nAvailable at https://www.watersa.net\\nISSN 1816-7950 (Online) = Water SA Vol. 45 No. 3 July 2019\\nPublished under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence (CC BY 4.0)\\n528\\nscale; (ii) difficulty in automation; and (iii) low reliability \\nand maintenance issues (Annandale et al., 2011; Lea-Cox, \\n2012; Belayneh et al., 2013). For most commercial nurseries, \\nthe initial cost and the ease of use are the most crucial \\nconsiderations for adopting a sensor-based irrigation system. \\nRegardless of these challenges, numerous sensors with the \\npotential to be adapted for use in nursery substrates are well \\ndocumented in the literature (Burnett and Van Iersel, 2008; \\nChappell et al., 2013; Bayer et al., 2015; Montesano et al., \\n2016; Saasvoss et al., 2016; Wheeler et al., 2017). Increasing \\nfreshwater scarcity, and pressure from governments, society, \\nand concerned bodies to conserve water, gives motive to \\ninvestigate sensor-based irrigation systems. Thus, the aim of \\nthis review was to evaluate commercially available soil water \\nsensors that can be connected to an automated irrigation \\nsystem to measure and control water status in small-volume \\nnursery containers to improve nursery water management.\\nSCheDUlINg IRRIgaTION IN Small-vOlUme \\nCONTaINeRS\\nSoilless substrates, as used in many commercial nurseries, \\nare generally porous and have relatively large particle sizes \\ncompared to mineral soils. They tend to release more water at \\nvery low matric potential (−1 to −40 kPa), which is 10 to 100 \\ntimes lower than the matric potential in mineral soils (Lea-\\nCox et al., 2011). Also, the rooting system of a nursery plant \\nis confined to the volume of the container. For these reasons, \\nmaintaining optimal water status for soilless substrates is \\ncritical for continued plant growth. A sensor-based system for \\nscheduling irrigation is a logical choice, and consists of sensors \\nlinked to an automated irrigation system that periodically \\nmeasure the substrate water status at a specified interval \\n(Nemali and Van Iersel, 2006; Van Iersel et al., 2013; Lea-Cox et \\nal., 2017; Kaptein et al., 2019). Since water use by the seedling, \\nalong with drainage and evaporation, causes a decrease in \\nsubstrate water level over time, the sensors detect these changes \\nin the substrate volumetric water content (VWC, m3∙m-3) or \\nsoil water potential (Ψ, kPa), and relay that information to \\nan irrigation controller (Fig. 2). The irrigation controller is \\nprogrammed to control (open) selected irrigation valves for \\nirrigation when the water level decreases below a set point \\n(Belayneh et al., 2013; Van Iersel et al., 2013; Bayer et al., 2015; \\nWheeler et al., 2017). The irrigation is then allowed to continue \\nuntil the upper set point of the programme is reached, at which \\ntime the irrigation valves are closed (Fig. 2).\\nIrrigation in small containers may be scheduled using \\ntwo properties, VWC or soil water potential, as described in \\ndetail by Jones (2004; 2008). The VWC indicates the quantity \\nof water available per unit volume of medium, which is easy \\nto measure and control as long as the lower limit (LL) and \\ndrained upper limit (DUL) thresholds are defined (Smith \\nFigure 1. Examples of different sizes of small containers used in many \\ncommercial forestry nurseries showing their associated volumes\\nFigure 2.

In contrast, the soil water \\npotential is the energy status of water per unit volume of \\nmedium, which directly determines whether the substrate \\nwater is available to plants (Scanlon et al., 2002; Jones, 2004; \\nBittelli, 2010; Lea-Cox et al., 2011). Both are related to each \\nother, but this relationship is different for different substrates \\nand depends on pore size distribution (Gebregiorgis and \\nSavage, 2006; Van Iersel et al., 2013). For example, substrates \\nwith larger pores hold less water compared to substrates with \\nsmall pores. This relationship can be determined using a \\nhydraulic conductivity relationship (Van Iersel et al., 2013; \\nSchindler et al., 2016). There is no consensus as to which \\nproperty is better suited for scheduling irrigation between the \\ntwo (Van Iersel et al., 2013), although VWC is relatively easy \\nto measure (Jones, 2004). If VWC is used, matric potential \\nshould also be estimated using hydraulic conductivity to \\ndetermine the plant available water. This is critical in highly \\nporous substrates such as pine bark due to its lower buffering \\ncapacity. Various VWC and soil water potential sensors that \\nmay be used in small-volume containers, and easily connected \\nto a programmable control unit, will be discussed.\\nvOlUmeTRIC waTeR CONTeNT meaSURemeNT \\nSeNSORS\\nThe main aim of measuring VWC is to monitor water status \\nas it diminishes and recharges within the root zone after each \\nirrigation event (Charlesworth, 2005). The commercially \\navailable soil water content sensors do not measure soil \\nwater content directly; instead they detect changes in other \\nsoil properties that can be related to the soil water content \\n(Charlesworth, 2005; Bittelli, 2010; 2011). The most common \\nsoil properties that change with soil water content and are \\neasy to measure include (i) dielectric permittivity (Van Iersel \\net al., 2013); and (ii) thermal conductivity (Song et al., 1998). \\nHowever, for accurate measurement, sensors need to be \\ncalibrated against the gravimetric method, which is the only \\ndirect soil water content measure (Smith and Mullins, 2000; \\nCharlesworth, 2005).\\nDielectric sensors\\nThe term ‘dielectric’ refers to the ability of a substance \\nto store charge from an electromagnetic field (Evett and \\nParkin, 2005; Van Iersel et al., 2013). These sensors use an \\nelectromagnetic technique to determine the VWC, since \\nwater has a much higher dielectric permittivity relative to \\nother constituents of the substrate (Smith and Mullins, 2000; \\nBogena et al., 2007; Bittelli, 2010). The main components \\nof a substrate that affect the dielectric permittivity are air, \\nsolid matrix and water content. The dielectric permittivity \\nof air and a solid matrix is 1 and 5, respectively, compared \\nto that of water which is 80 at 20°C (Czarnomski et al., \\n2005; Bogena et al., 2007; Nemali et al., 2007). Hence, a \\nsmall change in VWC can result in a significant change in \\nthe dielectric permittivity (Nemali et al., 2007; Van Iersel et \\nal., 2013). Thus, the measurement of dielectric permittivity \\ncan be used to indirectly estimate the media VWC through \\npredetermined calibration relationships using the equation \\nof Topp et al. (1980). For this review, frequency domain \\nreflectometry (FDR) and time domain reflectometry (TDR) \\nsensors will be further discussed due to their suitability for \\nuse in small-volume nursery containers.\\nFrequency domain reflectometry\\nMost FDR sensors (also referred to as capacitance sensors) \\nconsist of two prongs (positive and negative electrodes) that \\nproduce an electromagnetic field (Bittelli, 2010) when placed \\nparallel to each other (as shown in Fig. 3). The electromagnetic \\nfield is passed through dielectric material and then its ability \\nto store charge is measured. The charge stored by the substrate \\nand measured by a capacitor is directly related to the dielectric \\npermittivity of a substrate (Bogena et al., 2007). The sensor \\ncircuitry then converts the capacitor charge to a voltage, so it \\ncan be measured using a control unit. Since water molecules \\nstore charge more than other particles in the substrate, \\nthis charge storing ability can be related to VWC through \\nmeasurement of charge time t (s) using:\\n \\n \\n \\n(1)\\nwhere R (Ω) is the series resistance, C (μF) the capacitance, V \\n(V) the supply voltage, Vi the initial voltage and Vf the final \\nvoltage (Charlesworth, 2005). \\nWhen the VWC is high, the capacitor will charge slowly. \\nThis means that the capacitor of a sensor embedded in a wet \\nsubstrate will reach a given voltage threshold later compared to \\na capacitor in a dry substrate. More specifications, advantages \\nand disadvantages of FDR sensors are provided in Table 1.\\nThe FDR sensors are laboratory-calibrated by the \\nmanufacturer in different soilless substrates to produce a generic \\nequation. The factory generic calibration equation has an accuracy \\nrange of 0.03–0.05 m3∙m-3 (Meter Group, 2018a, 2018b). Although \\na generic equation may be used with reasonable accuracy, a \\nsubstrate-specific calibration may be conducted to estimate VWC \\nto within 0.01 m3∙m-3 of the actual VWC. For substrate-specific \\ncalibration, a single calibration equation could be used for a \\nsimilar model FDR sensor regardless of the substrate type (organic \\nor inorganic) (Nemali et al., 2007). Some of these sensors consist \\nof additional sensors that measure soil temperature and electrical \\nconductivity (EC) within the FDR sensor (Meter Group, 2018a, \\n2018b). These sensors have been used successfully to schedule \\nirrigation in several studies with highly porous soilless substrates \\nin nursery containers (Burnett and Van Iersel, 2008; Van Iersel et \\nal., 2010; Belayneh et al., 2013; Bayer et al., 2015; Montesano et al., \\n(\\n) (\\n)\\nln\\n/\\nf\\ni\\ni\\nf\\nt\\nRC\\nV\\nV\\nV\\nV\\nV\\n\\uf8ee\\n\\uf8f9\\n= −\\n−\\n+\\n−\\n\\uf8f0\\n\\uf8fb\\nFigure 3.

Improvements in \\nplant growth, reduction in water usage, and fewer incidences of \\npests and diseases were reported.\\nTime domain reflectometry\\nThe TDR technology was initially used to find the break in power \\nlines. Instead of manually inspecting a power line, a pulse is sent \\nalong the cable, and the time taken for the pulse to reflect indicates \\nthe precise point where the cable is broken. A TDR sensor works \\nsimilarly by sending electromagnetic waves from the pulse \\ngenerator of a cable tester to diffuse in the substrate where there is \\na parallel pair transmission line (Topp et al., 1984; Nobori, 1996). \\nElectromagnetic waves are diffused through a coaxial cable to \\na probe inserted in a substrate. Some of these electromagnetic \\nwaves are reflected at the beginning of the probe due to impedance \\ndifferences between the cable and the probe, whereas the rest of \\nthe waves diffuse through the probe until they reach the end of the \\nprobe where they are reflected (Noborio et al., 1996). Therefore, \\ndielectric permittivity can be calculated considering that the \\ntransmission velocity is determined from the known length of the \\ntransmission line in the substrate using (Topp et al., 1984):\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n/\\nKa\\n= ct l\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n(2)\\nwhere Ka is the soil dielectric constant, c the velocity of an \\nelectromagnetic signal in free space (i.e. speed of light, 3 x 108 \\nm∙s-1), t the travel time of the voltage pulse and l the length of \\nthe soil transmission line (mm). Since substrate water content is \\nthe main factor that alters the dielectric permittivity (Ka), VWC \\ncan be calculated using (Topp et al., 1980):\\n2\\n2\\n4\\n2\\n6\\n3\\nVWC \\n 5.3 10\\n2.92 10\\n –  5.5 10  \\n4.3 10  \\na\\na\\na\\nK\\nK\\nK\\n−\\n−\\n−\\n−\\n= −\\n×\\n+\\n×\\n×\\n+\\n×\\n(3)\\nThe specifications, advantages and disadvantages of TDR \\nsensors are further outlined in Table 1.\\nInfluence of substrate properties on dielectric \\npermittivity\\nThe dielectric permittivity may be influenced by factors other \\nthan the VWC (Smith and Mullins, 2000; Lukanu and Savage, \\n2006). Studies have indicated that dielectric sensors may be \\naffected by the substrate temperature and EC (Scanlon et al., \\n2002; Bogena et al., 2007; Bittelli, 2010; 2011). However, the new \\ngeneration of VWC sensors have a built-in temperature sensor \\nthat corrects for error in VWC estimation due to temperature \\nchanges, for example, a model 5TM or TEROS 10 (Meter \\nGroup, Inc., Pullman, WA, USA).\\nIn a nursery, most substrates used as potting media are a \\nunique blend of organic and inorganic materials, and seedlings \\nare frequently irrigated with water-soluble fertilisers. This can \\nresult in an increased concentration of ions of fertiliser salts \\nnear the electromagnetic field of a dielectric probe which could \\nweaken the electromagnetic energy and affect the measured \\nVWC (Nemali et al., 2007; Rosenbaum et al., 2010). In a study \\nby Kizito et al. (2008), a measurement frequency of 70 MHz \\nmitigated the effects of EC and temperature on FDR sensors \\n(model EC-5 and ECH2O-TE, Meter Group). Latest FDR sensors \\nmeasure dielectric permittivity using an oscillator operating at a \\nfrequency of 70 MHz making this sensor insensitive to EC below \\n10 dS∙m-1 (Meter Group, 2018a, 2018b). To be able to measure \\nin substrates with EC greater than 10 dS∙m-1, substrate-specific \\ncalibration is a necessity, although such high EC is extremely \\nuncommon in nursery substrates since it will most likely cause \\nroot death in most plant species. Increasing measurement \\nfrequency to higher frequencies (i.e. 150 MHz) decreases the \\nsensor sensitivity to EC considerably; however, this increases \\nsensor cost due to the increase in sensor electronics. \\nThe effect of poor substrate-to-sensor contact caused by \\nuneven packing of substrate in containers has been reported \\nby Bogena et al. (2007), Nemali et al. (2007) and Van Iersel \\net al. (2010). This may be critical in some nurseries where \\nthe substrate is manually packed in small-volume containers \\nTable 1.

Van \\nIersel et al. (2013) reported that measurement errors due to air \\nspaces can be improved by frequent irrigation schedules until \\nsubstrate particles settle around the sensor.\\nDual needle heat pulse sensors\\nThe dual needle heat pulse (DNHP) method was first suggested \\nby Campbell et al. (1991) and has since been used by several \\nresearchers (Tarara and Ham, 1997; Song et al., 1998; Ochsner \\net al., 2003). This technique measures changes in soil thermal \\nproperties (Song et al., 1998; Bittelli, 2010; 2011) caused by \\nthe variation in the VWC. Tarara and Ham (1997) describe \\nthe technique in detail, and Fig. 4 shows a probe with needle \\nlength of 30 mm. A heater and a temperature probe (usually a \\nthermocouple) are used to determine the substrate volumetric \\nheat capacity, which can be converted into VWC using:\\n(\\n)\\n(\\n2\\n [ /\\n –  19.92\\n  2.51\\n/ 4.18\\nm\\nm\\nVWC\\nq\\ne r\\nT\\nx\\nπ\\n\\uf8f9\\n=\\n∆\\n+\\n\\uf8fb\\n \\n(4)\\nwhere q (J∙m-1) is the heat applied per unit length of the line \\nsource, e is the natural logarithm base, r (m) is the distance \\nbetween the heater probe and temperature probe, ∆Tm is the \\nmaximum temperature increase of the needle (°C) and xm is \\ndetermined by dividing the substrate bulk density by particle \\nsize (Song et al., 1998).\\nThe small compact size of the DNHP sensor enables \\nmeasurements of small substrate volumes such as water content \\naround a growing seed (Tarara and Ham, 1997). Bristow et al. \\n(1993) compared the VWC as measured using DNHP sensors \\nversus the VWC measured by gamma attenuation in repacked \\nsoil in the laboratory. The DNHP sensors estimated VWC to \\nwithin 0.04 m3∙m-3 of the gamma attenuation method at both \\nthe LL and DUL. However, large differences between VWC \\nmeasured with DNHP sensors versus using the gravimetric \\nmethod were observed by Tarara and Ham (1997) at high water \\ncontent. At water contents less than 0.30 m3∙m-3, the DNHP \\nprobe estimates were within 0.06 m3∙m-3 of the gravimetric \\nmethod. The probes of this sensor type are very fragile and \\nspecial care needs to be taken so that the distance between the \\nneedle probes does not alter (Campbell et al., 1991; Bittelli, \\n2010). A needle deflection of 1 mm may cause a 6% error in \\nVWC measurements (Song et al., 1998; Scanlon et al., 2002). \\nThe conversion of a temperature signal from analogue to digital \\nmay cause a measurement error in ∆Tm (Bristow et al., 1993; \\nSong et al., 1998). This, however, can be minimised by increasing \\nthe datalogger sampling frequency by using a high resolution \\ndatalogger and applying sufficient power to the heater probe \\nso that ∆Tm exceeds 0.5°C. This sensor is also susceptible to \\nsubstrate temperature gradients (Scanlon et al., 2002), which \\nmay be significant in a nursery environment, and therefore \\nprecise substrate temperature measurements are needed. For \\nthese reasons, this type of sensor should be used with caution in \\nscheduling nursery irrigation, and, in most cases, is not practical.\\nmeaSURINg The SUbSTRaTe waTeR pOTeNTIal\\nThe concept of soil water potential is not new. As early as \\n1908, the first attempts to measure soil water potential were \\nconducted using the Livingston disc (Crawford, 2015). A dry \\nceramic disc would be weighed, then placed in soil so that it \\nequilibrated with the surroundings. After equilibration, it was \\nremoved, cleaned and weighed again. Soil water potential was \\nthen calculated using the water retention curve of the disc. \\nOver 100 years later, there have been many advances in soil \\nwater potential sensor technology, but these sensors still rely on \\nwater potential equilibration. Most commercially available soil \\nwater potential sensors accurately measure within the 0 to −100 \\nkPa range, which is ideal for most nursery crops since they \\ngenerally exhibit signs of water stress at matric potential less \\nthan −100 kPa. Different techniques for measuring soil water \\npotential in small-volume seedling containers are examined \\nand summarised in Table 2.\\nTensiometers\\nIn 1960, a liquid calibration technique called tensiometry was \\ndiscovered (Charlesworth, 2005). This method, along with \\nsoil psychrometry, was and still is the only direct method \\nof measuring soil water potential. If correctly installed, a \\ntensiometer is the most accurate soil water potential sensor in \\nwet substrate (0 to −90 kPa) (Charlesworth, 2005; Bittelli, 2010). \\nFor an in-depth understanding of tensiometer measurement \\ntheory, see Smith and Mullins (2000) and Bittelli (2010). The \\nadvantages and disadvantages of tensiometers are outlined \\nin Table 2. Small tensiometers fitted with transducers to \\nmeasure and control the water potential in small-volume \\nsoilless substrates were reported by Bittelli (2010). A schematic \\ndiagram of such a tensiometer is shown in Fig. 5, with a \\ndiameter of 5 mm for an easy fit in a small-volume container. \\nThe transducer is used to convert the tensiometer tension to an \\nelectrical signal that may be sensed by a control unit.\\nWhen tensiometers are used, precautionary measures are \\nnecessary to ensure direct contact between the porous ceramic \\ntensiometer tip and the substrate, and correct positioning \\nof the sensor. If the substrate shrinks, or the tensiometer is \\ndisturbed, this contact may be interrupted after which air \\nmay enter and break the water column resulting in inaccurate \\nmeasurements. In soilless substrates, fine roots might develop \\naround the ceramic tip. This is common when the substrate \\ndries out and the ceramic tip becomes an unreliable but \\nassured water source (Meter Group, 2009). When the substrate \\nbecomes drier than −90 kPa, cavitation occurs, where \\nliquid water pressure inside the tensiometer tube changes \\nto water vapour pressure causing spontaneous evaporation \\nand formation of air bubbles as described by Bittelli (2010). \\nHowever, the new commercially available tensiometers can \\nmeasure up to −500 kPa without cavitation, for example, a \\nmodel T5x mini tensiometer (Meter Group). This is made \\nFigure 4.

Van der Ploeg et al. (2010) also investigated \\npolymer tensiometers that are not affected by cavitation and \\nhave an extended measurement range to −2 000 kPa. These \\ntensiometers consist of a swelling polymer that creates a \\npositive pressure, and when the substrate is wet it absorbs \\nwater, creating a pressure offset. These tensiometers are, \\nhowever, not yet well researched for use in nursery soilless \\nsubstrates. Charlesworth (2005) reported on equitensiometers \\nthat use the principle of dielectric sensors to measure the \\nwater potential. These sensors do not require substrate-specific \\ncalibration since they measure the water potential of the \\nceramic material and not the surrounding substrate. \\nheat dissipation sensors\\nAs early as 1940, Shaw and Baver (1940) proved that soil water \\npotential could be inferred from the rate of heat dissipated \\nin the soil, and many sensors have been developed based on \\nthis relationship. Flint et al. (2002) described heat dissipation \\nprobe measurement theory in detail and a sensor is shown in \\nFig. 6. The sensor has a ceramic cup which equilibrates with the \\nsubstrate. Following equilibration, a heating element is heated \\nfor a specific period, and a change in the substrate temperature is \\nthen measured. The temperature change depends on the thermal \\nconductivity of the ceramic cup, which is affected by the VWC \\nof the substrate (Flint et al., 2002; Scanlon et al., 2002; Bittelli, \\n2010). Thus, the VWC, which is related to the water potential \\nof the ceramic cup, can be determined through a hydraulic \\nconductivity relationship.

Introduction', 'full_text': 'Performance of Rain Delay Features on Signal-BasedEvapotranspiration Irrigation ControllersD. C. Rutland, M.ASCE1; and M. D. Dukes2Abstract: Evapotranspiration-based irrigation controllers, also known as weather-based irrigation controllers, are a new water-saving tech-nology that use evapotranspiration (ET) estimates to schedule irrigation. Many ET controllers have the ability to incorporate rainfall eventsinto irrigation scheduling using onsite sensors attached to the controller or weather updates through weather-monitoring services. The ToroIntelli-Sense controller can use an onsite rain sensor (rain switch) that immediately interrupts irrigation or a weather service that causes thecontroller to enter a rain pause mode to incorporate rainfall into irrigation scheduling. Four treatments were created using the combination ofrain delay features: no rain delay features (TN), rain pause (TRP), rain switch (TRS), and both rain delay features (TRP-RS). A fixed-timeirrigation schedule with a rain switch and a fixed-time irrigation schedule without a rain switch were created for comparison: T, timer with arain switch; and TWORS, timer without a rain switch. During relatively dry periods (72% below historical seasonal rainfall) neither rain pausenor the rain switch resulted in irrigation reduction. However, during periods of rainfall (84% of historically rainy days), both features resultedin significant irrigation savings. The combination of rain switch and rain pause reduced irrigation 41% compared with the use of no rainfeatures, whereas the rain pause feature alone saved 25%. Because of the variability of rainfall in humid climates, using both a rain switch andthe rain pause feature is recommended to delay irrigation on the Toro Intelli-Sense controller.

Mayer et al. (1999) also found that residenceswith permanent irrigation systems controlled by a timer use 47%more water outside than homes with no permanent irrigation sys-tem. Among those that irrigated, only 15% were using water con-servation techniques outside of the home. Substantial water savingscould be realized with the incorporation of new “smart” irrigationtechnologies. Improved irrigation practices encompass improvedscheduling where real-time monitoring of weather conditions is im-perative to irrigation application (Carrow 2006). One of the emerg-ing technologies to help accomplish this goal is evapotranspiration(ET) irrigation controllers, also known as weather-based irrigationcontrollers.Toro’s Intelli-Sense (Riverside, California) controller is a signal-based evapotranspiration controller. Daily reference evapotrans-piration (ETo) values are calculated by Hydropoint’s WeatherTRAK(Riverside, California) system using the ASCE Penman-Monteithstandardized reference evapotranspiration equation (Hydropoint2003). These values are then sent to the controller using pagertechnology. Reference evapotranspiration is used to calculate cropevapotranspiration (ETc) using plant-type settings entered into thecontroller for each zone. Crop evapotranspiration is calculated dailyand summed from the last irrigation event. Once soil water depletionreaches the set point for the entered plant type of the irrigation zone,the controller will schedule an irrigation event and application depth.Although the controller can automate irrigation frequency on thebasis of irrigation need, irrigation frequency can also be predeter-mined by setting specific irrigation days or schedules. Crop coeffi-cients can be modified manually and rain pause features can also beenabled or disabled. Adjustable settings within the controller includeusable rainfall, sprinkler type, precipitation rates, sprinkler effi-ciency, soil type, plant type, root depth, slope, and shade.The Toro Intelli-Sense controller irrigates on the basis of dailywater balance calculations. The controller estimates the amount ofwater in the soil and irrigates only when soil water depletion hasreached the set value for a given irrigation zone. The settings inputby the user are used by the controller to determine schedule andirrigation run times. Irrigation frequency and depth fluctuate onthe basis of regional weather conditions.According to Hydropoint, ETo values are calculated to a reso-lution of 1 km2 (a “microzone”). Weather data are gathered frompublic databases such as the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration (NOAA) to collect weather information for regionalareas. In addition, other sources such as cities, states, water dis-tricts, and private organizations help to provide greater coverageresolution. Weather data collected from these weather stations then1Former Graduate Research Assistant, Agricultural and BiologicalEngineering Dept., Univ. of Florida, P.O. Box 110570, Gainesville,FL 32611-0570.

Data are used with the ASCEstandardized evapotranspiration methodology (ASCE-EWRI 2005)to calculate ETo.

The rain pausefeature pauses irrigation for a length of time determined byHydropoint.The Toro Intelli-Sense rain pause feature works in addition to arain switch that may be added to the controller. A rain switch is alsocalled a rain sensor and refers to a device that immediately inter-rupts irrigation in response to a predetermined amount of rainfall.Cardenas-Lailhacar and Dukes (2008) evaluated new expandingdisk rain switches and found them to be relatively accurate and withless than a year payback period in a rainy climate. In a follow-upstudy, Meeks et al. (2012) found that over time erratic behavior ofthese devices increased and recommended replacement of expand-ing disk material at least annually for best performance. When rain-fall is recorded by the weather network, a set number of days isdetermined that the controller should not irrigate on the basis ofdepth, intensity, duration of the rainfall event or events, and evapo-transpiration. Details of this determination are proprietary. Thenumber of days of rain pause is then sent to the controller wirelesslyalong with the ETo signal.The Toro Intelli-Sense controller does not bypass irrigation inthe same manner as a time clock and rain switch combination,which simply opens the valve control circuit as long as the rainswitch is in interrupt mode because of wet conditions. The ToroIntelli-Sense cannot interrupt irrigation events because it doesnot have a set schedule. Instead, it delays irrigation by not updatingthe soil water balance within the controller when the rain pause orrain switch is active. In other words, the controller assumes thatthere is no soil water depletion during the rainy periods. The rainpause feature can be updated by the weather service from the initialpause sent to the controller. Changes to the rain pause duration arelikely the result of reevaluation of rainfall and ETo by the weatherservice. In addition, the controller prioritizes the rain pause featureover that of the rain switch. If both features are activated, the con-troller will only show the use of the rain pause event, even thoughzones that do not have the rain pause feature activated are using therain switch for delay. Thus, recording a rain switch event during arain pause event is impossible.Many evapotranspiration (ET) irrigation controllers have thecapability to use rain features such as rain shutoff devices to bypassor delay irrigation during and after rain events. Cardenas-Lailhacarand Dukes (2008) investigated the possible savings that could beachieved by a rain switch. Two expanding disk rain switches wereused for comparison in the test, the Hunter Mini-Click and wirelessRain-Click (Hunter Industries, San Marcos, California). It wasshown that the mini-clicks responded close to their set points (3,13, and 25 mm). Theoretical water savings estimates ranged from3% at a 25-mm set point to 44% at a 3-mm set point. Meeks et al.(2012) found that some brands of expanding disk rain switches re-quired disk replacement annually for optimum performance.McCready et al. (2009) compared ET controller performancewith that of a regular homeowner time-based irrigation schedulewithout a rain switch. One of the evapotranspiration controllersused was the Toro Intelli-Sense controller. A rain switch was notadded to the controller; however, the useable rainfall percentagewas set at 100%, which allowed for full use of the rain pause fea-ture. Despite low rainfall amounts compared with historical aver-ages, the Toro controller saved 59% of water compared with anirrigation system without an ET controller.Davis et al. (2009) compared ET controller performance withthat of a regular homeowner time-based irrigation schedule withouta rain switch. ET controllers used in the study were the Weather-matic SL1600 (Dallas, TX), Toro Intelli-Sense, and ET WaterSmart Controller (Corte Madera, CA). The Weathermatic SL1600has a rain switch incorporated into its weather monitor, and a rainswitch was attached to the Toro Intelli-Sense for rainfall measure-ment. The ET Water controller sends both ETo and rainfall data tothe controller from weather station measurements. Even during dryconditions, overall the ET controllers saved an average of 43% withrespect to timed irrigation system with no rain switch.Vasanth et al. (2007) found that the Toro Intelli-Sense controlleroverirrigated compared with other smart irrigation technologies. Inaddition, the Toro controller was not fitted with a rain switch andonly used the rain pause system for water budget modification.Overirrigation was attributed to the controller using regionalrainfall data from the weather service rather than site-specific rain-fall data.Although savings are seen from rainshut off devices with respectto time-based controllers, ET controllers may have variable irriga-tion frequencies and depths. On the basis of previous research, therain delay features of the Toro Intelli-Sense should enhance thewater-saving capabilities of the controller; however, this capabilityhas not been specifically documented. Use of the Toro Intelli-Sensecontroller in rainy climates heightens the need for better under-standing of its integrated rainfall features. The objective of thisstudy was to determine the effectiveness of the rainfall features ofthe Toro Intelli-Sense controller by determining the water savingsachieved compared with the controller without those features.Materials and MethodsThis research was conducted at the University of Florida Gulf CoastResearch and Education Center (GCREC), Wimauma, Florida, on20 existing plots of established St. Augustinegrass (Stenotaphrumsecundatum, “Floratam”) bordered on one side by mixed ornamen-tals. The turfgrass and mixed ornamentals area of each plot mea-sured 60 m2 by 33 m2, respectively. All 20 plots were bordered bya 15-cm-tall black metal barrier. Each plot was separated by abuffer zone of 3 m covered with a plastic weed barrier on all sides.Each plot received a separate irrigation line for turfgrass andmixed ornamentals. Hunter (San Marcos, CA) SRV solenoid valvesand Elster AMCO Water (Ocala, FL) V100 flow meters were usedin combination to operate and monitor the irrigation system. Thisexperiment used only the irrigated turfgrass portions of the plots.Digital collection of the flow meter data was accomplished by wir-ing each flow meter to one of five Campbell Scientific (Logan, UT)SDM-SW8A switch closure input modules that were monitored bya Campbell Scientific CR-10x datalogger. Each reading had a res-olution of 18.9 L and was totaled hourly by the datalogger. Manualreadings were taken weekly to verify logged data. Data from theToro Intelli-Sense ET controllers were manually collected Mondaythrough Friday. This data consisted of daily ETo, weekly ETo, timeof signal reception, percent water depletion, and status of the rainpause and rain switch features.Rain Bird R13-18 (Glendora, CA) rotary nozzles on model 180615-cm popup spray bodies were used for the turfgrass irrigationsystem on all plots. Each plot contained four half-circle nozzles(R13-18H) located at the midpoint of the borders and one full-circlenozzle (R13-18F) located in the center. All heads have a docu-mented application rate of 15-mm/hr at pressures of 206 to 380 kPa.Microirrigation spray heads from Maxijet (Dundee, FL) were in-stalled in the ornamental section of the plots. A 138-kPa pressureJOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING © ASCE / NOVEMBER 2012 / 979regulator was installed for the microirrigation in each plot. Pressureregulators at the manifold maintained approximately 380 kPa.Five irrigation treatments were established as follows: TN, ToroIntelli-Sense with no rain switch and the rain pause feature set at0% usable rainfall; TRP, Toro Intelli-Sense with no rain switchand 100% usable rainfall; TRS, Toro Intelli-Sense with HunterMini-Clik rain switch set at a 6-mm threshold and 0% usable rain-fall; TRP-RS, Toro Intelli-Sense with Hunter Mini-Clik rain switchset at a 6-mm threshold and 100% usable rainfall (Table 1); T, timeschedule using a recommended irrigation schedule for the region(Dukes and Haman 2002) using a Rainbird timer with a HunterMini-Clik rain switch set at 6 mm. TRS and TN treatments usedthe microirrigation spray heads for water application. These treat-ments used a modified application rate in the controller to match theapplication rate on the turfgrass zones of the other experimentaltreatments. The T treatment was implemented using a traditionalirrigation time clock. A theoretical time-based treatment withouta rain switch (Time WORS) was created to determine water savingscreated by the attached rain shutoff device. Time WORS was cre-ated by substituting bypassed irrigation events that occurred on theT treatment because of activation of the rain switch in response torainfall.Historical rainfall depth and frequency were calculated using a30-year average from a weather station in Parrish, Florida, operatedby the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)approximately 20 km southwest of the project site (27°37′N;82°21′W).A total of five periods of data collection were used: summer2008, June 25, 2008, to August 31, 2008; fall 2008, September1, 2008, to November 30, 2008; winter 2008–2009, December 1,2008, to February 28, 2009; spring 2009, March 1, 2009 to May 31,2009; and summer 2009, June 1, 2009, to August 31, 2009. All ETcontroller treatments were allowed to irrigate any day of the weekand at any frequency automatically determined by the controller.The treatments using the rain pause feature had usable rainfall set-tings adjusted to 100%, whereas TRS and TN had the usable rain-fall settings adjusted to 0%. For summer 2009, the usable rainfallsettings for TRS and TN were changed to 25%. The timer treat-ments were scheduled for two irrigation events per week (Table 1).The total weekly irrigation was compared across treatments.Delay days were quantified by number of recorded days with a rainpause or rain switch event active on the controller. Statistical analy-sis was performed with SAS statistical software (SAS Institute,Cary, NC) with weeks as a repeated measure. The general linearmodel (GLM) was used assuming a 95% confidence interval. Leastsquare means separation was conducted using Tukey’s procedurefor pairwise comparison. All data were confirmed to be normalbefore conducting the comparative analysis.Results and DiscussionEvery month in the 14-month study period was drier than the his-torical average except for two months: July 2008 (9% higher thanhistorical rainfall) and May 2009 (156% higher than historical rain-fall). All seasons received less than historical average rainfall. Rain-fall between July 2008 and August 2009 totaled 1,175 mm, whichis 35% less than the historical rainfall value of 1,806 mm (Fig. 1).There were 51 days of rainfall totaling 6 mm or more, leaving 88%of the 427 days without rainfall above 6 mm, the rain switch thresh-old (Fig. 2).The TRP-RS treatment encountered 114 days during which ir-rigation was delayed because of either the rain pause or the rainswitch. Using just the rain pause feature (TRP) resulted in 72 re-corded rain pauses over the course of the monitoring period.TRS and TN treatments were created to compare and contrastthe effects of a rain switch when not using the rain pause feature ofthe controller. The Toro Intelli-Sense does not have a method fordirectly turning off the rain pause feature. The Toro technical staffrelayed that by turning the usable rainfall setting to 0% that thecontroller would not use the rain pause feature. During spring2009 it was discovered that TRS was not bypassing irrigation dur-ing rain switch events. It was determined that if the usable rainfallsetting is entered as 0%, the controller will not use the rain shutoffdevice as a means of irrigation bypass during or after rainfall eventseven when the controller displays that the rain shutoff device is inbypass mode. To counter this effect, the TRS treatment was set to25% (values increment by 25%) for summer 2009 (Table 1); thus,the TRS results are only reported for this period. The new settingTable 1.

There were 14 days of rainfall totaling 6 mm ormore, compared with the historical average of 18 days (Fig. 2). TheToro controller without the rain switch or rain pause features (TN)resulted in similar irrigation application as the fixed-time treatment(T) with a rain switch (21.7–23.8 mm=week; Table 2); however,both Toro controllers using RP applied significantly less irrigation(8.6–12.9 mm=week) than the fixed-time treatments and Toro con-troller without rain delay features (Fig. 3). The addition of a rainswitch to a Toro controller with rain pause (TRP-RS) did not in-crease irrigation savings for this period (Table 2) compared withrain pause alone (TRP). The addition of a rain switch to a controllerwith rain pause (TRP-RS) delayed irrigation significantly morethan using the rain pause feature alone (TRP); however, the in-crease of delay days did not significantly affect the weekly irriga-tion applied (Table 3). This result was because although the rainswitch did increase delay time, these times did not coincide withneeded irrigation events. All treatments with rain features signifi-cantly reduced weekly irrigation compared with the fixed-timetreatment without a rain switch (TWORS).Fall 2008A total of 93 mm of rain fell during the entire 91-day period, whichwas 72% less than the historical average of 334 mm (Fig. 1).Similarly, there were 5 days of rainfall totaling 6 mm or more,which was less than half the historical average of 12 days (Fig. 2).As a result of the dry weather, the use of rain features did not save asignificant amount of water during this period. All rain-savingsexperimental treatments resulted in between 10.2 mm and11.0 mm=week of irrigation (Table 2). Despite the low rainfall, theTRP-RS and TRP treatments recorded rain pause events (Table 3);however, these events did not save significant amounts of watercompared with the TN treatment, which did not use rainfall features(Fig. 4). The reduction in ET during the fall season lowered theirrigation frequency and reduced the disparity between irrigation-delay periods. In contrast, all ET controller combinations signifi-cantly reduced water application compared with the time schedule,similar to the results reported by Davis et al. (2009). Adding a rainswitch to the timer did not result in significant irrigation reduction,again because of dry conditions.Winter 2008–2009This season received the least amount of total rainfall at 86 mm(Fig. 1). There were 5 days of rainfall totaling 6 mm or more com-pared with the historical average of 8 days (Fig. 2). The use of rainfeatures did not save a significant amount of irrigation during thisperiod similar to the fall.

As in the fall 2008 season,the rain pause and rain switch events that were recorded (Table 3)failed to save water because of lower irrigation frequency andrainfall (Fig. 5).Spring 2009Rainfall in this season totaled 193 mm, with no rainfall in April and161 mm of rainfall occurring in the last two weeks of May (Fig. 1).Six days of rainfall totaled 6 mm or more compared with the his-torical average of 8 days (Fig. 2). The controller with no rain delayfeatures (TN) resulted in similar irrigation application to the fixed-time treatment with a rain switch (T) (Table 2). The combination ofrain pause and rain switch (TRP-RS) saved more water than thetreatment with no rain features active (TN) and the fixed-time treat-ments with and without a rain switch (34–44%) (Fig. 6); however,the addition of a rain switch to a controller using the rain pausefeature (TRP-RS) did not save a significant amount of water forthis period (Table 2) compared with a controller using rainpause feature alone (TRP). The fixed-time treatment with a rainswitch (T, 22.2 mm=week) applied a similar amount of weekly ir-rigation to the Toro controller with no rain features enabled(TN, 23.8 mm=week).Summer 2009Although this period did not receive the least amount of precipi-tation, a difference of 249 mm between cumulative recorded rain-fall and cumulative historical rainfall shows the greatest deficit tohistorical rainfall out of the five seasons (Fig. 1). A total of 21 daysof recorded rainfall of 6 mm or greater, the most out of all seasonsduring the study period, compared with the historical average of25 days (Fig. 2). In this season the addition of a rain switch(TRP-RS) did not save a significant amount of irrigation (9.3vs. 15.4 mm=week, respectively) when compared with using therain pause feature alone (TRP), although there was a trend for lessirrigation using both the rain pause feature and a rain switch. TheToro controller using only the rain switch (TRS) saved more water(45%) than the Toro controller using only the rain pause feature(TRP) but did not save a significant amount of water when com-pared with the Toro controller using both rain delay features (TRP-RS) (Table 2). The Toro controller with no rain features enabled(TN) applied similar weekly irrigation to the fixed-time treatmentwith a rain switch (T), approximately 20 mm=week. The similarityin TN and T treatments could possibly be the result of the Torocontroller balancing the soil water balance as effectively as a timedtreatment with a rain sensor attached. The fixed-time treatmentwithout a rain switch (TWORS) applied significantly more water(33.8 mm=week) than all treatments during this period. This seasonhad the greatest rainfall frequency out of all of the seasons. Thehigher rainfall frequency increased the number of days irrigationwas delayed for treatments with rain features enabled comparedwith the treatment with no rain features enabled (Fig. 7). Althoughthe Toro controller with both rain features enabled (TRP-RS) de-layed irrigation significantly more than the TRS and TRP Torotreatments, the number of days of delay were not directly relatedto water savings (Table 3).

However, during these two seasons, thefrequency of irrigation was less because of reduced ET rates rela-tive to spring and summer. Reduction in irrigation frequency re-duces the chances of irrigation delay resulting from controllerrainfall features. Although there were still rainfall events significantenough to cause rain features to delay irrigation, water applicationwas not significantly reduced because of lower ET rates and lowerirrigation frequency.The spring 2009 period experienced less rainfall frequency buthad similar total rainfall to cumulative historical averages, therebyshowing a trend in which a rain switch in combination with the rainpause feature can reduce irrigation on a Toro Intelli-Sense control-ler during average periods of cumulative rainfall. The cumulativerainfall for the summer 2009 period was less than the historicalaverage; however, rainfall frequency was near the historical aver-age, which shows that the addition of a rain switch significantlyimproved water savings during times of average rainfall frequencywhen using only the rain pause feature did not. Overall, the use of arain switch in addition to the rain pause feature reduced irrigation41% when compared with the use of no rain features, whereas theuse of the rain pause feature alone reduced irrigation by 25%.During periods of rainfall, a properly scheduled irrigation timerworking with a rain switch applied a similar amount of watercompared with a Toro Intelli-Sense ET controller without activerain features.One advantage of an ET controller is its ability to remove anyhomeowner error from irrigation of the home lawn. Rain switchesrequire maintenance and proper installation to function correctly.When working properly, the attached rain shutoff device set at a6-mm threshold saved more water than the rain pause events sentout by the weather service. The weather service attempts to removehomeowner errors by removing homeowners from regular respon-sibilities associated with irrigation timer adjustments. Because ofthe spatial variability of rainfall in humid climates, weather stationswould likely miss rainfall events that occur in the immediate area ofthe controller. On the basis of the savings shown in this study, it isrecommended that a rain switch be installed on a Toro Intelli-SenseET irrigation controller in addition to proper use of the rain pausefeature.AcknowledgmentsThe authors recognize the support staff of the Agricultural andBiological Engineering Department and the Gulf Coast Researchand Education Center for the success of this research.ReferencesASCE-Environmental and Water Resources Institute (ASCE-EWRI).(2005).

Previous research has shown that ET controllers could reduce irrigationas much as 42% when compared to a time-based irrigation schedule. The objective of this study was todetermine the capability of three brands of ET-based irrigation controllers to schedule irrigation com-pared to a theoretically derived soil water balance model based on the Irrigation Association Smart WaterApplication Technologies (SWAT) protocol to determine the effectiveness of irrigation scheduling. Fivetreatments were established, T1–T5, replicated four times for a total of twenty ﬁeld plots in a com-pletely randomized block design. The irrigation treatments were as follows: T1, Weathermatic SL1600with SLW15 weather monitor; T2, Toro Intelli-sense; T3, ETwater Smart Controller 100; T4, a time-basedtreatment determined by local recommendations; and T5, a reduced time-based treatment 60% of T4.All treatments utilized rain sensors set at a 6 mm threshold. A daily soil water balance model was usedto calculate the theoretical irrigation requirements for comparison with actual irrigation water applied.Calculated in 30-day running totals, irrigation adequacy and scheduling efﬁciency were used to quantifyunder- and over-irrigation, respectively. The study period, 25 May 2006 through 27 November 2007, wasdrier than the historical average with a total of 1326 mm of rainfall compared to 1979 mm for the samehistorical period. It was found that all treatments applied less irrigation than required for all seasons.Additionally, the ET controllers applied only half of the irrigation calculated for the theoretical require-ment for each irrigation event, on average. Irrigation adequacy decreased when the ET controllers wereallowed to irrigate any day of the week. All treatments had decreased scheduling efﬁciency averages inthe rainy season with the largest decrease of 29 percentile points with a timer and rain sensor (T4) and anaverage decrease of 20 percentile points for the ET controllers, indicating that site speciﬁc rainfall has asigniﬁcant effect on scheduling efﬁciency results. Rainfall did not drastically impact the average irrigationadequacy results. For this study, there were two controller program settings that impacted the results.The ﬁrst setting was the crop coefﬁcients where speciﬁc values were chosen for the location of the studywhen calculating the theoretical requirement whereas the controllers used default values. The secondsetting was the soil type that deﬁnes the soil water holding capacity of the soil. The ET controllers wereable to regularly adjust to real-time weather, unlike the conventional irrigation timers. However, theincorporation of site speciﬁc rainfall measurements is extremely important to their success at managinglandscape water needs and at a minimum a rain sensor should be used.© 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The method commonly used by homeownersinvolves observing the lawn and irrigating when it looks stressed(Wade and Waltz, 2004). However, research has shown that sin-gle families in Florida over-irrigate their landscapes due to themisunderstanding of seasonal water needs or the inconvenienceof updating the irrigation time clock to reﬂect actual water needsof the landscape (Haley et al., 2007). Alternatively, the quantita-tive method measures plant needs from soil moisture levels usinginstruments such as tensiometers or dielectric probes or evapo-transpiration loss (Wade and Waltz, 2004).0378-3774/$ – see front matter © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.doi:10.1016/j.agwat.2010.07.00620S.L. Davis, M.D. Dukes / Agricultural Water Management 98 (2010) 19–28Evapotranspiration (ET) is deﬁned as the evaporation from asoil surface and the transpiration from plant material (Allen et al.,1998). ET is part of a balanced energy budget that exchanges energyfor outgoing water at the surface of the plant. Parameters that driveET are solar radiation, temperature, relative humidity, and windspeed (ASCE-EWRI, 2005). Reference ET (ETO) is deﬁned as the ETfrom a hypothetical reference crop with the characteristics of anactively growing, well-watered, dense green cool season grass ofuniform height (ASCE-EWRI, 2005).Evapotranspiration-based controllers, also known as ET con-trollers, are irrigation controllers that use ETOto scheduleirrigation. Depending on manufacturer, ET controllers can be pro-grammed with various conditions speciﬁc to the landscape makingthem more efﬁcient (Riley, 2005). ET controllers receive ETO infor-mation in three general ways, consequently dividing ET controllersinto three main types: (1) standalone controllers, (2) signal-basedcontrollers, and (3) historical-based controllers.Standalone controllers typically measure climatic variablesfrom on-site sensors and then calculate ETO. Even though thecontrollers might take readings every second or every 15 min,cumulative daily ETO is used for irrigation scheduling. On-site sen-sors could include: temperature, solar radiation, an ET gauge, oreven a full weather station (Riley, 2005). Beneﬁts of standalonecontrollers are that they are not limited by requiring the use of afull weather station and there are not signal fees associated withbroadcasts from the manufacturer (Riley, 2005).Signal-based controllers receive ETO data via wireless commu-nication. Depending on the manufacturer, the ETO data can be froman average of multiple weather stations in the area or from a singleweather station. There is typically a signal fee (i.e., subscription) forthis controller set by the manufacturer that normally ranges fromUS$ 4 to 15 per month (Riley, 2005).Historical-based controllers rely on historical ETO informationfor the area. Typically, monthly historical ETO is programmed intothe controller by the manufacturer or installing contractor and thenadjusted based on site speciﬁc weather measurements to betteraccount for differences in current ETO from historical trends.Bench testing or virtual studies have been conducted whereresults were determined from whether the controllers would haveaccurately irrigated based on scheduling and ETO estimation. TheMetropolitan Water District of Southern California conducted ayear-long bench test in 2002 designed to compare the ability of ETcontrollers to determine theoretical water needs for three types oflandscapes: cool season turf on loam with full sun, shaded annualson sandy soils, and low water using ground cover on a sunny, 20◦degree slope. The WeatherTRAK-enabled controller (signal-based)always applied less water than the maximum allowable waterallowance resulting in no overwatering. This controller performedthe water balance sufﬁciently so that water received equaledwater required except for the summer months where the con-troller showed a deﬁcit in irrigation. Percent soil moisture depletionfor all scenarios except for the sloped case, where over-irrigationoccurred, fell within a 30–70% target range and minimized runoff(Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, 2004). A virtualstudy was conducted in 2003, also using a WeatherTRAK-enabledcontroller, designed to determine the data used by the controllers,ease of setup and operation, and how accurate they were atmatching irrigation needs to ﬁve types of landscapes consistingof turfgrass, trees/shrubs, annuals, mixed high water use plants,and mixed low water use plants. Irrigation equaled the turf-grass requirements in April and October only; over-irrigation was21–40% in March, June, and July, over 40% in November, and 11–20%for the rest of the year. It was concluded that poor results weredue to very general controller settings including using default uni-formity and precipitation rates (Pittenger et al., 2004). Davis etal. (2009) reported that ET controllers could potentially produceannual savings of 42% when compared to a time-based irrigationschedule that replaces the net irrigation requirement without con-sidering real-time rainfall and still maintain good turfgrass quality.Smart Water Application Technologies (SWAT) is an effort of theIrrigation Association that has developed a protocol for determin-ing the effectiveness of irrigation scheduling by ET controllers. Theprotocol was designed to measure the ability of ET controllers toschedule irrigation that is adequate and efﬁcient while minimizingrun-off. Adequacy is a measure of under-irrigation and schedulingefﬁciency is a measure of over-irrigation determined from a soilwater balance model (Irrigation Association, 2008).Properirrigationmanagementcouldresultinasmuchas a two-fold reduction in water usage (Florida Departmentof Environmental Protection, 2002). Also, improper irrigation,whether it is under-irrigation or over-irrigation, can negativelyimpact landscapes as well as waste water resources (Burt et al.,1997). The objective of this study was to determine the capabil-ity of three brands of ET-based irrigation controllers to scheduleirrigation compared to a theoretically derived soil water balancemodel.2. Materials and methodsThis study was conducted at the University of Florida Gulf CoastResearch and Education Center (GCREC) in Wimauma, FL. Therewere a total of twenty 7.62 m × 12.2 m plots. Each plot consisted of65% St. Augustinegrass (Stenotaphrum secundatum ‘Floratam’) and35% mixed ornamentals to represent a typical residential landscapein Florida. Results focus on the turfgrass. Landscapes were main-tained through mowing, pruning, edging, mulching, fertilization,and pest and weed control according to current UF-IFAS recom-mendations (Black and Ruppert, 1998; Sartain, 1991). Weatherdata were collected at 15 min intervals for the following vari-ables: wind speed, solar radiation, temperature, relative humidity,and rainfall depth from a Florida Automated Weather Network(FAWN) weather station located onsite. This paper provides addi-tional results from the ﬁeld study presented by Davis et al. (2009).Five treatments were established, T1 through T5, replicatedfour times for a total of twenty plots in a completely random-ized block design. The irrigation treatments were as follows: T1,SL1600 controller with SLW15 weather monitor (Weathermatic,Inc., Dallas, TX); T2, Intelli-sense (Toro Company, Inc., Riverside,CA) utilizing the WeatherTRAK ET Everywhere service (HydropointDatasystems, Inc., Petaluma, CA); T3, Smart Controller 100 (ETwaterSystems LCC, Corte Madera, CA); T4, a time-based treatment deter-mined by UF-IFAS recommendations (Dukes and Haman, 2002);and T5, a reduced time-based treatment that is 60% of T4. TheET controllers were purchased as commercially-available equip-ment and were programmed using the manuals provided by themanufacturers according to site speciﬁc conditions. Technical sup-port was contacted only when necessary throughout the course ofthe study. All treatments except the Weathermatic utilized Mini-Clik rain sensors (Hunter Industries, Inc., San Marcos, CA) set at a6 mm threshold. The Weathermatic weather monitor included anexpanding disk rain sensor that was set at a 6 mm treshold. Watermeters (11.4 cm V100 w/Pulse Output, AMCO Water Metering Sys-tems, Ocala, FL) were used to monitor irrigation water applicationon St. Augustinegrass with automated data acquisition as describedby Davis et al. (2009).The amount of water held by the root zone available to the plantis available water, AW (mm) and is calculated as follows:AW = (FC − PWP) × RZ100(1)where FC (cm3 of water/cm3 of soil) is the ﬁeld capacity, PWP (cm3of water/cm3 of soil) is the permanent wilting point, and RZ (mm)S.L. Davis, M.D. Dukes / Agricultural Water Management 98 (2010) 19–2821is the root zone depth (Irrigation Association, 2005). To preventplant stress, available water should not be allowed to reach thePWP before irrigation is scheduled; irrigation should be appliedwhen the water level drops by a percentage known as the maxi-mum allowable depletion (MAD), chosen as 50% for warm seasonturfgrass (Allen et al., 1998). The amount of water allowed toleave the root zone before irrigation is required is readily availablewater, RAW (mm), and is calculated using the following equation(Irrigation Association, 2005):RAW = AW × MAD(2)The soil type at the project site was mapped as Zolfo ﬁne sand(Natural Resources Conservation Service, 1989). According to thesoil survey, the Zolfo series is a somewhat poorly drained soilcomposed of sandy, siliceous, hyperthermic Grossarenic Entic Hap-lohumods. From the literature, the ﬁeld capacity and permanentwilting point for Zolfo ﬁne sand was given as 13% and 3% (all soilmoisture values are presented on a volumetric basis), respectively(Carlisle et al., 1985).A daily soil water balance model was used to calculate thetheoretical irrigation requirements for comparison with actual irri-gation water applied. The balance is deﬁned as:Di = Di−1 − (P − RO)i − IN,i − CRi + ETC,i + DPi(3)where D (mm) is the soil water depletion assuming i is the currentday and i − 1 is the previous day, P (mm) is the daily precipitation,RO (mm) is the runoff, INET (mm) is the net irrigation depth, CR (mm)is the capillary rise, ETC (mm) is the crop evapotranspiration, and DP(mm) is the deep percolation (Allen et al., 1998). This equation wassimpliﬁed since the water table for the research site is deeper than1 m, thus CR was estimated as zero. For the purposes of estimatingan ideal irrigation schedule, DP was estimated as zero because thesoil moisture content of the root zone was not allowed to exceedﬁeld capacity.Precipitation in southwest Florida is exclusively rainfall. Theamount of rainfall able to be held by the root zone, shown in Eq. (3)as (P − RO)i, can also be represented as effective rainfall, RE (mm).Rainfall causing the soil water content to exceed ﬁeld capacity inthe soil water balance model was considered lost due to runoff ordrainage.Net irrigation was calculated for the theoretical requirementso that irrigation occurred when the readily available water wasdepleted and the depth of irrigation applied was the differencebetween ﬁeld capacity and the soil water level. In this case, IN equalsthe amount of water the soil can effectively hold. For the purposesof evaluating irrigation controllers, the depth of irrigation able to beheld by the root zone at the time of a controller irrigation event isthe effective irrigation, IE (mm). Any irrigation application causingthe soil water level to exceed ﬁeld capacity was considered surplus.By taking into account the assumptions used for this study,equation 3 can be simpliﬁed to:Di = Di−1 − RE,i − IE,i + ETC,i(4)According to the manufacturers (Hydropoint Data Systems Inc.,2003; ETwater Systems, 2005), ETO was calculated by the Toroand ETwater controllers using the ASCE standardized ETO equation(ASCE-EWRI, 2005). The Weathermatic controller utilized the Har-greaves equation to estimate ETO (Hargreaves and Samani, 1982).The ASCE-EWRI standardized ETO equation was used in the soilwater balance model for comparison purposes.Plant-speciﬁc ET can be calculated for a plant material by apply-ing a crop coefﬁcient (Kc), using the following equation:ETC = Kc × ETO(5)The Kc values chosen for the theoretical soil water balance modelwere interpolated between north-central and south Florida warmTable 1Monthly crop coefﬁcients for the Tampa area were interpolated from coefﬁcientsmeasured in north-central (Citra, FL) and south Florida and were used for the theo-retical irrigation requirement.MonthNorth-central FloridaSouth FloridaInterpolated ValuesJanuary0.350.700.45February0.350.780.45March0.550.770.65April0.800.850.80May0.901.00.90June0.750.850.75July0.700.850.70August0.700.900.70September0.750.850.75October0.700.840.70November0.600.820.60December0.450.700.45season turfgrass values from Jia et al. (2009) (Table 1) since thestudy location is in between these two regions. The Weathermaticcontroller used a ﬁxed Kc value of 0.60 for each month. The Kc valuesfor the Toro and ETwater controllers were considered proprietaryinformation and were not made available.Gross irrigation (IG) was calculated to compare to the measuredamount of water applied by the treatments. The gross irrigationdepth is calculated from net irrigation using an efﬁciency factor ulti-mately determined from the low quarter distribution uniformity(DUlq) of the system (Irrigation Association, 2005). Originally, theuniformity was not known and the controllers were programmedwith near perfect efﬁciency values (Davis et al., 2009). As theﬁeld study progressed, on-site catch-can testing was performed todetermine that the DUlq averaged for the ﬁeld site was 0.70. Thelow half distribution uniformity (DUlh) was calculated using DUlqin percentage form as follows:DUlh = 38.6 + 0.614 × DUlq(5)which, in turn, was used to calculate the application efﬁciency fac-tor (AE) using the equation:AE = 100DUlh(6)The gross irrigation was calculated by multiplying the net irri-gation depth by the efﬁciency factor, determined from Eqs. (5) and(6) to be 1.25 (Irrigation Association, 2005). The controllers wereupdated with the efﬁciency factor beginning spring 2007 (Davis etal., 2009). The efﬁciency factor used for the theoretical irrigationrequirement reﬂected the controller settings.The current method for evaluating irrigation scheduling tech-niques by ET controllers uses the SWAT protocol developed bythe Irrigation Association (Irrigation Association, 2008). The SWATprotocol describes the comparison of irrigation application by ETcontrollers to the soil water balance to determine if the con-trollers over- or under-irrigate. The controller performance underthe SWAT test is valid if ETO and rainfall total 63.5 mm and 10.2 mm,respectively, summed over a 30-day period. The treatments of thisstudy were evaluated using the soil water balance developed tocalculate the theoretical irrigation requirement.Scheduling efﬁciency (%) was deﬁned as the ability of a con-troller to schedule irrigation without applying excess irrigation thatresults in drainage or runoff (Irrigation Association, 2008). It wascalculated in 30-day running totals with the following equation:E = IN − SurplusIN× 100(7)where IN (mm) is the sum of net irrigation applied over the 30 daysand Surplus (mm) is the summed depth of water above the ﬁeldcapacity.22S.L.

Measured total rainfall and effective rainfall determined from the soil waterbalance model for the study period using the weather station in Balm, FL.Irrigation adequacy (%), on the other hand, quantiﬁes the abil-ity of the controller to supply sufﬁcient irrigation to meet plantdemand (Irrigation Association, 2008). It was also calculated in30-day running totals using the following equation:A = ETC − DeﬁcitETC× 100(8)where Deﬁcit (mm) represents the sum of the depth of water belowthe maximum allowable depletion over the 30-day period.This study began on 13 August 2006 and ended on 27 November2007. Though there were ﬁve seasons of data collection, only threedistinct seasons are discussed here: 1 December 2006 through 26February 2007 as winter 2006–2007; 27 February 2007–31 May2007 as spring 2007; and 1 June 2007–31 August 2007 as sum-mer 2007. Applied irrigation depths were compared to a theoreticalrequirement calculated using a daily soil water balance with inputssimilar to user-deﬁned inputs programmed into the controllers forall seasons (Davis et al., 2009).3. Results and discussionThirty year historical rainfall averages were calculated frommonthly rainfall data collected by the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration (2005) from 1975 through 2005approximately 28 km away, in Parrish, FL. All months received lessrain than historical average except for April 2007, 69% higher thanaverage, and October 2007, 104% higher than average (Davis et al.,2009). Overall, both years were drier than the historical averagewith a total of 1326 mm of rainfall for the approximate 16-monthstudy period, August 2006 through November 2007, compared to1979 mm for the same historical period.High intensity and large rainfall events can lead to runoff ordrainage below the root zone. The portion of rainfall stored in theroot zone is considered effective in that this precipitation can con-tribute to plant water needs. The cumulative depth of effectiverainfall from the daily soil water balance, 600 mm, was 69% lessthan the total cumulative rainfall, 1934 mm, over the treatmentperiod (Fig. 1). Only a fraction of each event, averaging 38% whendaily rainfall totaled more than 6 mm, was able to be stored in theroot zone on a regular basis due to the limited turfgrass root zoneof 15 cm and the low soil water holding capacity of 10% by volume(Carlisle et al., 1985).Similar to the overall rainfall conditions, most of the seasonsexperienced less than adequate rainfall. Winter 2006–2007 had167 mm of rainfall occurring from 16 events over 88 days (Table 2).Even more severe conditions occurred during spring 2007 where109 mm of rainfall occurred in only 9 events with no rainfall occur-Table 2Cumulative rainfall and number of rainfall events for each season.SeasonRainfallTotal (mm)Events (#)Winter 06-0716716Spring 071099Summer 0744637ring in May. However, there were some periods of frequent rainfalldespite the overall trend. A distinct wet period occurred duringsummer 2007 where 446 mm fell in 37 events.In the soil water balance model, measured rainfall depth wasused as an input and effective rainfall was calculated based on thedepth required to ﬁll the root zone to ﬁeld capacity. However, ETcontrollers use a variety of methods to handle rainfall dependingon the manufacturer.The Weathermatic controller incorporated rainfall by using anexpanding disk rain sensor. This controller bypassed irrigation for48 h when the rain sensor sensed rainfall based on a 6 mm setthreshold; whereas, the rain sensors on the remaining controllershave been shown to dry out between 85% of the time within 30 hafter rainfall (Cardenas-Lailhacar and Dukes, 2008). This controllermaintains an accumulating deﬁcit total based on ETC losses andirrigates to reﬁll the deﬁcit total regardless of soil water hold-ing capacity. The controller was designed to operate in areas withmandatory watering restrictions. When enough rain falls to triggerthe rain sensor (6 mm setting), the deﬁcit is reduced by 25.4 mm/huntil reset to zero (Weathermatic, 2005).The Toro controller was connected to a rain sensor, similarto all of the treatments, but the controller treats the rain sensorbypass mode as a non-watering day. When the rain sensor bypassesirrigation, the controller keeps track of the number of days andthen applies irrigation as if rain never occurred. This results inmore irrigation applied than required since irrigation supplementsrainfall. This controller, however, is sent a rainfall signal by theWeatherTRAK ET Everywhere system to incorporate rainfall intothe determination of irrigation applied. This is done by setting cer-tain rainfall depths to the number of days the controller shouldwait until irrigation should be resumed. Rainfall depths are col-lected from the public weather station that the manufacturer usesto calculate ETO and may or may not reﬂect the rainfall amount atthe controller location.During the entire treatment period, the ETwater controller didnot recognize the rain sensor and did not bypass irrigation accord-ing to localized rainfall events. Rainfall was taken into account withthe soil water balance when scheduling irrigation, but the weatherstation used was over 10 miles away from the project site (ETwaterWebsite, 2006). Rainfall can vary substantially over short distancesin Florida.The Weathermatic and ETwater controllers began treatmentson May 25, 2006; however, hardware issues with the ETwater con-troller arose late in the summer season causing the controller tobe nonfunctional. As a result, the ETwater controller did not con-trol irrigation during the fall 2006 and winter 2006–2007 seasons.Once the controller was repaired, the programmed settings wereupdated to reﬂect settings described for spring 2007. However,maximum allowable depletion was set to 25% instead of 50% forunknown reasons and remained that way for the spring, summer,and fall 2007 seasons. The Toro controller was not installed untilAugust 13, 2006.The time-based treatments applied irrigation twice per week forevery season unless bypass occurred due to rainfall or time-clockmalfunction. The irrigation schedule was developed from the netirrigation requirement determined from historical ET and effectiverainfall and was adjusted monthly. T4 was set for 60% replacementS.L.

The irrigation schedule for T5, the reduced time-basedtreatment, was set for 36% replacement for winter 2006–2007 and60% replacement for spring and summer 2007. As a result, T4 func-tioned similarly to a historical ET controller with a crop coefﬁcientthe same as the Weathermatic controller for the ﬁrst three sea-sons while T5 did so for the last three seasons. The ﬁrst threeseasons for T5 could possibly be considered a deﬁcit treatmentdue to 36% being approximately half of any of the average cropcoefﬁcients.3.1. WeathermaticThe Weathermatic controller under-irrigated by 3% compared tothe theoretical irrigation requirement, applying 80 mm and 82 mm,respectively, for the winter 2006–2007 season (Table 3). This con-troller also under-irrigated during the spring 2007 season by 26%,applying 267 and 361 mm, respectively. Irrigation application var-ied between these seasons due to the removal of day-of-the-weekwater restrictions. As a result, 84 irrigation events occurred outof a possible 94 events during the spring season (irrigation couldoccur any day) compared to only 16 irrigation events out of apossible 25 events in the winter season (irrigation restricted to 2d/wk) (Table 4). Consequently, average irrigation applied per eventwas greater for the winter season than the spring season, but thecontroller irrigated less than the theoretical requirement for bothseasons, averaging 41% less for the winter season and 69% less forthe spring season. Irrigation occurred on every allowable wateringday by the Weathermatic controller unless in bypass mode due tothe rain sensor.Cumulative irrigation applied by the Weathermatic con-troller was less than the theoretical requirement during winter2006–2007 and spring 2007. This was due to the combination ofusing a lower crop coefﬁcient (0.6 ﬁxed) than was representativeof the actual site and the 48-h rain sensor bypass period whichaccumulated irrigation deﬁcits. The 48-h bypass is longer than theaverage dry out period of 24 h for expanding disk rain sensorsas indicated in recent research by Cardenas-Lailhacar and Dukes(2008).Scheduling efﬁciency results for this controller were generallyhigh, averaging 91% for winter 2006–2007 and 94% for spring 2007(Table 5). Efﬁciency results were high due to irrigation applica-tion per event being approximately half of the irrigation simulatedby the soil water balance, resulting in little over-irrigation due toexcessive run times. Irrigation adequacy averaged 100% with onlya few instances of less than perfect results occurring in the winterseason. This was not surprising due to the similar cumulative irri-gation application between the Weathermatic and the theoreticalTable 4The number of days irrigation occurred and the total number of irrigation events possible for each season.SeasonWinter 2006–2007Spring 2007Summer 2007AppliedTheoreticalAppliedTheoreticalAppliedTheoreticalWeathermatic16108435NAaNAToro121062355524ETwaterNANA94648447Time201026351824Reduced Time201026351724Possible Events2594b/27c92/26a NA indicates seasons where the treatment was not working.b Total number of possible irrigation events for the ET controllers, Weathermatic, Toro, and ETwater.c Total number of possible irrigation events for the time-based treatments, Time and Reduced Time.24S.L.

However, irrigation adequacy results were less thanperfect due to the combination of water savings for the season aswell as less irrigation application per event, averaging 90% for thespring season.Turfgrass quality was evaluated for every season using meth-ods described in the National Turfgrass Evaluation Program (NTEP)handbook (Shearman and Morris, 1998). Ratings were chosen basedmostly on density and color using a scale from 1 to 9 where 1represents dead turf and 9 represents perfection. Acceptable turf-grass quality was considered a 5 rating.

Around 70% of Africans are rural dwellers and aremostly of the poor populace which depends majorly on agribusiness to maintain sus-tainability and employment. Agribusiness is the principal wellspring for sustenance for60–70% of the populace in sub-Sahara Africa. This sector is confronted with severaldifﬁculties making it hard to meet its main role of nourishing the country [1].The increasing growth of the global population with over 7 billion individuals andan estimated increase of 9.6 billion by the year 2050 [2] shows that there is a need todouble generation and production within a discreetly brief time. This will be essentialin achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1 and 2, “NO POVERTY” and“ZERO HUNGER”. There is a need to change the traditional agricultural practice inorder to meet the rising demands of food security thus contributing effectively to thereduction of poverty and hunger in the economy.Recently, 90% of food production in sub-Saharan comes from small-scale farmers,cultivating on an exact piece of the 70% of arable land accessible, depending on rainfall© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018H. Florez et al. (Eds.): ICAI 2018, CCIS 942, pp. 198–212, 2018.https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-01535-0_15as opposed to irrigation [3]. Agriculture practice in Africa is faced with numerouschallenges some of which includes:1. Poor Power Supply to Farms2. Poor Irrigation, Fertilization and Drainage System3. Poor Transportation Network4. Limited access to funds5. Poor Farm MechanizationThese challenges have made agricultural practice frustrating for the farmer and alsocontributed to the poor turn-out in large-scale farming. This study, however, focuses onautomated irrigation system with a clean and affordable power supply which is a majorfactor associated with large-scale farming in Africa.Automating Irrigation system is an intelligent or artiﬁcial application of water foreffective agriculture and cultivation production. This condition is essential for insuf-ﬁcient rainfall with its focus on supplying satisfactory quantity of water at the righttime for improving growth and development of farm produce. In agricultural irrigation,the effects of the applied amount of water, the timing of irrigation and water utilizationare particularly important. With the increasing water requirements in irrigation systems,there is a need for an automated water system with scheduling features to save about80% of the water thus, improving water efﬁciency and agricultural productivity ingeneral particularly under conditions of water scarcity [4]. The rest of the paper isdivided into sections where: Sect. 2 gave a comprehensive description of the literaturereview and Sect. 3 gave a detailed methodology. The system implementation andtesting is discussed in Sect. 4 and the conclusion and future recommendation issummarized in Sect. 5.2Literature ReviewThe major limitations in sustainable agricultural development and advancement in thesub-Saharan include the crude way in farm practices and production, low efﬁciency andpoor technological adaptation. Thus, current headway is the need for a system thatmakes the agricultural process simpler and stress-free for farmers thereby increasing theannual/seasonal production through creating an agro-driven environment. Severalworks has been done by researchers globally, in developing a smart irrigation controllersystem.2.1Related WorkVarious methodologies have been adapted to implement most of the smart irrigationsystems over the years. This technology includes the use of wireless communications,weighing lysimeter technique, SCADA systems for supervisory and Artiﬁcial NeuralNetwork (ANN).Smart-Solar Irrigation System (SMIS) for Sustainable Agriculture1992.2Irrigation System Based on Wireless Communication TechnologiesThis section describes the various types of wireless communication protocols and itsstandards that are being adopted in agriculture varying from Zigbee wireless protocol,Bluetooth, Wiﬁ, GPRS, etc. The fast advancement of wireless communication andembedded micro-sensing electromechanical systems (MEMS) technologies has madewireless sensor networks (WSN) possible.[5] designed an autonomous solar-powered irrigation system using GPRS, Zigbee,and Radio connectivity. The system designed to consist of two major units; the wirelesssensor units and the wireless information unit linked together using radio transceivers.The wireless sensor is conﬁgured using ZigBee technology and ﬁrms the sensors, amicrocontroller, and power sources. Several wireless sensors can be utilized in-ﬁeld toconﬁgure a distributed sensor network for the automated irrigation system. [6] pre-sented a soil moisture sensor to estimate the soil volumetric water content. The sensoris based on the soils dielectric constant also known as soil bulk permittivity. In hisdesign, the temperature of the soil was measured using LM35 wrapped-in. The tem-perature and the soil moisture level measured are read using an Arduino Uno and theanalog values are converted appropriately and the result is displayed on the LCD whileit is also sent to the control room located few distances away from the farmland sentwirelessly using Bluetooth technology.[7] proposed an automated wireless watering system which has a user-friendlyinterface to notify with information regarding the system status. The system wasdesigned to enable the user with the option of operating it manually or automatic andalso provides a data history of the activities of the system. [8] proposed a wirelesssensor technology to automate the Indian agricultural systems. The proposed systemwas able to control several data such as Humidity, Soil Moisture, and Soil pH using thewireless sensor nodes which serve as inputs to the Peripheral Interface Controller(PIC). These data are continuously monitored by the controller and a GSM modem wasincorporated to send SMS to the farmer. The summary of the cons and pros of wirelesscommunication technology is depicted in Table 1.Table 1. Pros and cons of a wireless communication technology.Wireless communication technologiesProsCons1. Enables remote monitoring and control byUser or farmerThis is a major barrier to implementing IOTenabled irrigation because it tends to increasethe cost by acquiring internet services2. Enables collecting, storing and sharing ofdata through web servers for agriculturalimprovements3. Mobile Application and GSMcommunication are easily integrated withthe system and enable instant notiﬁcation ofsystem operations200O. Abayomi-Alli et al.2.3Irrigation System Based on Weighing Lysimeter TechniqueA lysimeter is a device used in agronomy to measure the volume of incoming water(rainfall and irrigation) and water coming out (drainage, evapotranspiration) of acontainer containing an isolated mass of soil [9]. [9] designed an irrigation systembased on a weighing lysimeter for potted plants. The system consist of a triangularplatform that supports the pot rests on three load cells located at their vertices and areused to measure the weight. In order to measure the irrigation water, a high-precisionlow-range ﬂow meter was required. [4] developed a prototype smart watering systemfor small potted plants. The system consists of a microcontroller (ATmega328),moisture and temperature sensors, water pump and the servo engine. The pros and consof the lysimeter techniques are represented in Table 2.2.4Irrigation System Based on SCADA SoftwareSupervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) is a PC framework for thegathering and examination of real-time information [10]. This utilizes a focal frame-work that examines and controls the entire conﬁguration of other systems, which isstretched over distances of long range. [10] developed and implemented a solar-powered irrigation system using SCADA software. The parameters used are the soilmoisture condition, suns position, water level condition, etc. The pros and cons arelisted in Table 3.2.5Irrigation System Based on Artiﬁcial Neural NetworkRecently, “Machine to Machine (M2 M) and ANN” communications is getting moreattention, the capacity of information transfer among gadgets to servers or CloudTable 2.

ANN control systems can beutilized to accomplish the deﬁnitive point of water management on farmland [11]. [12]proposed the application of ANN controllers using MATLAB for irrigation purposes.The parameter used in the proposed study is based on natural temperature and watercontent in the soil. The experiment was demonstrated using environmental conditions,evapotranspiration and the kind of crop. However, the measure of water required forthe water system is assessed and related outcomes were evaluated. [13] developed anintelligent IOT based Automated Irrigation system where sensor information relating tosoil dampness and temperature gathered and likewise, kNN arrangement machinelearning calculation sent for analyzing the sensor information for expectation towardsﬂooding the soil with water. This is a completely automated with devices communi-cating with the other and apply the intelligence in irrigation. This has been createdutilizing minimal cost embedded systems like Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi3.Considering the existing work on automating irrigation system there are needs for amore enhance Agric-support system with efﬁcient power, cost-effective and functionalsystem in rural areas and beyond. Table 4 shows the overview of related study basedon automatic irrigation system.3Design MethodologyThis section gives a detailed description of the proposed system design and its spec-iﬁcation. Considering the cost of manpower, cost of powering a pumping machine, andcost of effectively monitoring of an irrigation process within a large expanse offarmland, there is a need for a smart irrigation system. The Solar Smart IrrigationSystem (SMIS) is designed to speciﬁc requirements. These requirements are catego-rized as follows;1. Hardware requirements2. Software requirements3.1Hardware RequirementThis stage is divided into two main parts namely the central control unit and the sensorunits. The central control unit act as the brain of the entire system and its major role isto coordinate and manage the activities of the different parts of the system whichinclude the solar panel, battery, microcontroller (ATmega328), solenoid valve and theﬂoat channels. While the sensory units consist of the soil moisture sensor for gatheringdata about the soil moisture content and send feedback to the central control unitautomatically. Wireless communication was established between the central controlunit and the sensory part using near radio frequency (NRF4L). Each of the sensor unitand the central control unit is designed to have an independent solar power supply builtwith the system. The block diagram of the system is shown in Fig. 1.202O.

Abayomi-Alli et al.3.2Software RequirementThe SMIS was designed to enable the user operates the system manually from a controlroom using Bluetooth technology. The mobile application is built to function onAndroid Operating System. The choice of Bluetooth network as a communication linkbetween the mobile application and the hardware device is based on the power con-sumption, cheaper and less complexity when compared with ZigBee or Wi-Fi tech-nology.

In addition, different parts of thesystem were examined and tested in order to ensure that the proposed system plays upto its required capacity.206O. Abayomi-Alli et al.4.1Hardware ImplementationThe hardware implementation consists of the following engineering practical stepswhich include the circuit Boarding Process, PCB Design, Soldering of Components,and Packaging.Circuit Boarding Process: The control unit and the sensing unit were simulated on abread board to ascertain the workability of all components before the system is com-pleted. During the course of bread boarding, copper jumper cables were us to establishconnections between components and the Arduino microcontroller. The soil moisturesensor connected to the wireless transmission link was also simulated. 5 V powersupply from the USB was used in the simulation process.PCB Design: Printed Circuit Board (PCB) is cards made for connecting modernelectronics components together. It represents the electrical schematics in the physicalimplementation. However when partitioning the PCB layout, the component posi-tioning is very important. Components are grouped into logical functional blocks.The PCB layout of this system was properly designed using Proteus software.Soldering of Components: After the boarding process is completed and the PCBdesign is ready, the components were placed on the PCB pad and soldered on the tracesto establish a permanent connection as shown in Fig. 4.Packaging: The Control Unit part of the system was packaged using plastic casingwith the solar panel mounted on it. In packaging the system some design considerationwas taking into account to ensure smooth operation of the system. The solar panel wasproperly positioned on the top layer of the casing. The inlet and outlet piping systemwere properly sealed and aligned to avoid water leakage. The sensory unit waspackaged in a plastic casing ﬁtted with a cylindrical pipe to enable the soil moisturesensor to penetrate the soil as depicted in Fig. 5. The Figs. 6 and 7 shows the snapshotof control unit and the sensory unit.Fig. 4. The soldered components of the controlunitFig. 5. The packaging of the Control UnitSmart-Solar Irrigation System (SMIS) for Sustainable Agriculture2074.2SMIS Mobile Application ImplementationThe Android mobile application was developed using React Native. React Native is aJavaScript framework for building native mobile applications. It allows for largeamounts of inbuilt components like camera, GPS, and APIs. React Native has thenative ability just like normal Android Java, Native Mobile and is faster.Other JavaScript packages are used to implement this project together with ReactNative. These are a subset of libraries that enables some special features. For theimplementation of the Bluetooth communication, react native – Ble-Plx was deployed.Geo Location API is deployed to get to the location of the system. Open Weather APIwas also deployed to get the real-time weather of the location. Figure 8 shows thescreenshot of the SMIS mobile application.Fig. 6. The Control UnitFig. 7. The Sensory UnitFig. 8. Screenshot of SMIS mobile application208O. Abayomi-Alli et al.4.3TestingIn this section, different tests were conducted to monitor and verify the operations andperformance of the developed system. The key tests conducted in this project are:1. Unit Testing2. Integration Testing3. System TestingUnit Testing: The system developed consists of different components and two(2) major subsystem which was coupled together to obtain the whole system. Tests onunits independent of one another were carried out such as the resistance and capaci-tance values before circuit connections. The solar panel was tested in order to ensurethat it provides the necessary voltage and current supply when it is connected to chargethe battery. The transistors, capacitors, and resistors were also tested in order to ensurethat they were functioning properly. The NRF and Bluetooth module were individuallytested to ensure functionality and connection from varying range. The power supplyunit of each subsystem consists of 5 V solar panel connected to charge the storagebattery of 3.7 V. The test was carried out using millimeters to take the readings of thesolar panel and the battery to ascertain how much voltage is stored and how long ittakes to be fully charged. The control unit consists of the microcontroller, solenoidvalve, the Bluetooth module and the NRF receiver for communication with the sensorunit. The sensory unit consists of the soil moisture sensor and the NRF transmitter.Each unit was tested to ensure compatibility and functionality within the subsystem.Integration Testing: The interaction between separate subsystems of the project wasevaluated using the integration testing including the user application software. Table 5shows the various voltage levels obtained at different outputs of the system. Theexpected values obtained during the system design and the practical values obtainedduring the implementation of the project are also compared.System Testing: The full operation of the system was tested from the user’s experi-ence using the mobile application developed for control of the systems full operation.The complete system was tested for correct operation by applying the system to irrigatedifferent soil samples. Figure 9, shows the amount of time the system took to irrigatedifferent soil samples in different initial states.Table 5.

It can be deducedfrom the graph that the system was able to irrigate a effectively a dry soil, sample forthe soil type: sandy soil, loamy and clay soil at 12 s, 20 s and 30 s respectively. Whileirrigating a partial wet soil for sandy, loamy and clay gave a 10 s, 13 s, and 20 srespectively. The time taken to irrigate a wet soil sample for sandy, loamy and clay are6 s, 7 s, and 12 s respectively.5ConclusionThe climatic changes in sub-Sahara Africa nations has made sustainable agriculturequite challenging due to the harsh sun radiation, scarcity of water which is completelyup to individual’s water generation. These factors however, have been coined towardsthe development of a smart solar irrigation system with the aim of addressing thechallenges of power consumption and water management for sustainable agriculture inthe sub-Sahara Africa. The system incorporates solar panels as its power source whichenables the system to work effectively without the need of an AC source. Watermanagement is achieved by the timely operations of the solenoid valve controlled bythe microcontroller. The experimental result shows effectiveness of the proposedsystem with the practical values being so close to the expected result. In conclusion, theefﬁciency of the system guarantees that only the right amount of water need is suppliedto the farmland and it can operate both automatically and manually for scheduledirrigation. Further study is to enhance the system over the internet using advancedmobile application.05101520253035DryParƟally WetWetSandyLoamyClayFig. 9. Graph of irrigation time against soil samples.210O.

However, traditional irrigation systems are inefficient and inexact, leading to either insufficient or excessive watering. Moreover, it is difficult for farmers to predict suitable quantities at the appropriate time. Manual monitoring of the crop field may also lead to human error and is potentially risky for rural areas. Farmers may also not be aware of intrusions if they are not on location. Therefore, this project is designed to develop a smart monitoring and automated irrigation system to provide not only efficient water consumption based on specific conditions, but also enables real-time monitoring of the environment. Furthermore, this system prevents damage to plants and reduces the likelihood of plant theft. This system uses NodeMCU ESP32 as a microcontroller that collects environmental data such as humidity, temperature, soil moisture levels from sensors. The NodeMCU is integrated with a relay and RTC module to irrigate plants at specific times and is also equipped with a passive infrared sensor to detect intruders near the crop-field. Upon detection, an ESP32 camera is used to automatically capture the current conditions and farmers will be subsequently notified. Warnings are also sent to farmers upon detection of unwanted circumstances such as extreme temperature, which could prevent instances of open burning. The utility of the developed prototype is evident in the way it automatically irrigates the crop field without human intervention.

Advances in sensor technologies, networking, and data analytics can aid in fulfilling this task by automatically collecting, analyzing and reporting real-time data to infer irrigators’ practices and behaviors, crop water requirements, water applications and use. In this research, an automated irrigation water withdrawal and water use monitoring and data collection system was deployed to monitor actual irrigation dynamics for 31 commercial and large-scale agricultural production fields for three consecutive years. Production scale fields (representing a total of 1050 ha) included center pivot (P), gravity (surface/furrow) (G) and subsurface drip-irrigated (S) fields. On average, irrigation was initiated 40–70 days after planting (DAP) and terminated by 120–140 DAP. The proportion of irrigation systems operating simultaneously and peak water abstraction were highest (70–90 %) during July and August. Mean depth of water applied across all fields was 243, 264 and 284 mm in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. Site-specific monitoring of precipitation, soil moisture, and evaporative demand and a soil-water balance model resulted in mean seasonal irrigation requirement estimates of 394, 242 and 184 mm, in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively; for maize; and 307, 163 and 219 mm in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, for soybean. Despite reduction of calculated mean irrigation requirement in 2014 and 2015 by 40–50 %, actual irrigation applications by producers did not change considerably and irrigation applied exceeded irrigation water requirements in 80 % of the fields, suggesting needs for irrigation water management technology implementation and associated educational programs in the region. Some fields showed irrigation applications exceeding the mean annual allocated (moratorium) irrigation depth (305 mm), implying that irrigation decisions are still largely driven by non-scientific and/or technical methods. While substantial farm-to-farm heterogeneity makes it challenging to robustly benchmarking regional water footprint and irrigator behavior, it also creates an opportunity for developing and implementing methodologies and strategies for real-time monitoring of farm-level irrigation dynamics. New advances in technologies with telemetry capabilities as well as internet of things (IoTs) can be leveraged to effectively create databases, track and compare water usage to better plan, allocate, distribute, monitor and manage limited water resources for enhancing agricultural productivity. These processes can also be used for education and demonstration for irrigation professionals to enhance adoption of such technologies. This research has the potential for technology and strategy transfer for advanced water management to other regions in the United States and globally.\\n\\nPrevious article in issueNext article in issue\\nKeywords\\nAutomationEvapotranspirationIrrigationMaizeSoil moistureSoybeanTelemetryWater management\\n1. introduction\\nDue to the nature of the novel goal of producing food, fiber and fuel demand of rapidly-growing world’s population, agricultural irrigation, in many cases, is the largest customer of global freshwater resources with 70–80 % of the total water withdrawal from ground and surface water resources globally (OECD, 2021; Gordon et al., 2010). In many cases, it is stated by different researchers, scientists and other non-experts in water resources engineering, agricultural water management, agricultural engineering disciplines that “irrigated agriculture consumes 70–80 % of water withdrawn water resources,” which is not accurate and is misleading as not all water withdrawn from ground or surface water resources is consumed by plants and a considerable portion of water withdrawn and delivered to the production fields through irrigation systems returns to its sources. The amount of water withdrawn that returns to the source is a function of numerous factors, including irrigation method, soil characteristics, crop type and crop growth stage, climate conditions, soil and crop management practices, effectiveness of irrigation management, irrigation method, etc. On a rough estimate, in the United States, about 42 % of the total water withdrawal is for irrigation purposes (ERS, 2015), which is experiencing increasing pressure for improved efficiency to produce significantly more food and fiber and other commodities. In addition to proper assessment, forecasting, planning, effectively managing limited freshwater resources requires transparency in accounting and analysis of irrigation water withdrawal and use characteristics at appropriate scales. This immense and critical task is typically accomplished by site-specific measurement of environmental, biophysical, and micrometeorological parameters or by estimation of irrigation water requirements by relying on empirical and other approaches.\\n\\nIrrigation water requirement in agriculture can be defined as the adequate amount of water that must be artificially supplied to the crop for achieving ideal crop growth, quality and desired yield in cases where the amount of precipitation and stored soil-water are not sufficient to meet crop water demand for achieving potential yield. The primary unknown in order to accurately determining irrigation water requirement is crop water use or crop evapotranspiration (ETc), which is driven by weather conditions (solar radiation, relative humidity, air temperature, wind speed, vapor pressure deficit), soil and crop management practices (including tillage practices, seeding rate, row spacing, etc.), crop type and growth (including leaf area index, leaf orientation etc.), soil properties (soil texture, field capcity, permanent wilting point, water holding capcity), root development (root density, rooting depth), soil-water availability, time of the year, time of the day (for hourly time step) and other factors. ETc can be measured via advanced techniques such as lysimeters, surface renewal, Bowen Ratio Energy Balance Systems, and Eddy Correlation Systems (Steduto and Hsiao, 1998, Irmak and Irmak, 2008, Irmak, 2010, Li et al., 2008, Snyder et al., 1996). Despite high representativeness and accuracy, these measurement techniques can be quite laborious, expensive, require trained professionals, time-consuming and can be used only on certain areas due to their nature of operations. As convenient alternatives, estimation methods such as two-step approach (i.e., ETc = reference ET x crop coefficient) can be used to calculate ETc. However, this approach is subject to assumptions that do not consider variability in soil and crop practices, variety differences, and other factors that different commercial fields are managed with. Moreover, evaporative demand at a particular site may vary considerably than what is calculated at a nearby weather monitoring site, due to microclimate impacts from specific management practices, e.g., tillage (Irmak et al., 2019), irrigation method (Cavero et al., 2009), terrain characteristics, etc. This results in compromising of the site-specificity of ETc and irrigation requirements that are needed for precise assessment and management of water in producers fields. In contrast, several sensor technologies, network, and data advances make it possible to observe and record irrigation water withdrawal, ETc as well as irrigator behaviour at individual farms simultaneously by avoiding the complications encountered in the abovementioned technical approaches that rely on energy balance principles. Several critical variables that drive ETc and irrigation water withdrawal can be measured independently and site-specifically to render robust data on regional irrigation-related characteristics in real- or near real-time. These technologies include atmometers (ETgauges) that can be deployed in-field to measure site-specific evaporative demand by closely resembling plant’s resistance to ETc (Alam and Trooien, 2001, Magliulo et al., 2003, Irmak et al., 2005a, Chen and Robinson, 2009), soil moisture sensors installed in the crop root zone to report soil-water depletion (Wetzel and Chang, 1987) and precipitation gauges.\\n\\nIn addition, measurement of flow rate and volume of water pumped by an individual producer aids in determining and improving irrigation water productivity (IWP), crop water productivity (CWP), determining pumping plant efficiency; detecting various technical and operational well, pump, pipes and irrigation system malfunctions that result in improved irrigation water delivery and use. A variety of flow measurement devices are available to measure instantaneous and total flow rate applied to a particular field throughout the growing season. Various state water management agencies such as, Water Management Districts, Natural Resources Districts (NRDs), etc., have been established to monitor irrigation water consumption by implementing the management plans and strategies in their specific areas. In Nebraska, NRDs regulate groundwater resources and Department of Natural Resources (DNR) regulates surfacewater resources. The difference between NRDs and irrigation districts is that NRDs are responsible for regulating groundwater and developing rules for withdrawal, allocations, etc., whereas irrigation districts are usually responsible for delivering the water to the irrigators. For example, in Nebraska, regulations are imposed by NRDs to install water meters on the irrigation systems which helps keep a check on producers to monitor and/or limit their water withdrawal to the allocated amount with respect to the allocated amount. However, these rules and regulations vary in respective geographic areas of concern and are decided by the local NRDs according to the requirements in the concerned area. In some NRDs, flowmeters are required on all wells and/or on new wells, and some NRDs require flowmeters in sub-areas or in certain areas, whereas irrigation water allocation/moratorium rule are employed by some NRDs. For example in the larger Republican River Basin, Upper, Middle and Lower Republican NRDs impose different amount of water allocations (moratoriums). Based on the Stakeholders Advisory Committee (2016), the Lower Republican NRD (LRNRD) established a moratorium (restriction on the amount of water irrigators can pump during a given time) on new irrigation well drilling on December 9, 2002. No new irrigation wells have been drilled since that date. District established a moratorium on adding new irrigated lands on December 31, 2004. No new irrigated land has been added since that date. All groundwater irrigated areas were certified in 2004 and all wells were metered by April 1, 2005. The Lower Republican NRD has the lowest groundwater allocation in the state. The present allocation is 230 mm/yr. NRD allocates a 5 year block for 1143 mm and the water may be used however the irrigator chooses during that 5 years unless there is an allocation cap. NRD allows up to 230 mm to be carried over the end of an allocation period to the next allocation period. Unless otherwise provided, imposition of penalties for exceeding the allocation amounts shall be at the discretion of the NRD Board and may include, but are not limited to: (a) A reduction (in whole or in part) of a person’s allocation of groundwater; (b) A reduction (in whole or in part) of a person’s certified irrigated acres; and (c) Decommissioning of water wells. Penalty for exceeding carry over include deducting 50 mm carryover deducted for every inch of carry-over used above 190 mm. The Middle Republican NRD (MRNRD) is and will continue to enforce all of the management actions that have been described in the handout such as: Moratorium on new irrigation wells and acres; Abiding our 4th generation of the Integrated Management Plan; helping producers with programs for their irrigated land; implementing allocations and penalties; and much more that we have been doing for years already within our district. The MRNRD currently has 1524/5-yr allocation rule imposed. In cases when unused amount of water remained from the allocated amount, it is carried over to the next allocation cycle. If an irrigator has exceeded his/her allocation, the allocation for the next allocation period shall be reduced by the number of acre inches, by which said allocation was exceeded in the prior period. A penalty of 25.4 mm for every inch over the first 76 mm and 50 mm for every mm over 76 mm of overuse will be applied. Moratoriums in the Republican River Basin do not consider the cropping pattern grown in a given year, although most district has maize-soybean rotation. Based on the Republican River Basin-Wide Plan (2018), the Upper Republican NRD (URNRD) has prohibited new irrigation wells since 1998. Any replacement irrigation well, replacement livestock well, replacement industrial well or replacement public water system must be at least 183 m from any domestic well or range livestock well, 805 m from a public water supply well, and 305 from any irrigation well, commercial livestock well or industrial well. No wells can be connected without prior approval from the URNRD. In all three NRDS, any person who violates a cease-and-desist order issued by the district pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. §46–707(h) may be subject to a civil penalty assessed pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. §46–745.\\n\\nTo monitor water withdrawal by irrigators, NRD personnel travel long distances and manually read the meters installed at the registered wells once a year after the irrigation season and record the readings. These readings are used to keep a check on the water pumped to keep a sustainable balance between water use and water supply which ensures the region’s economic viability, social and environmental health/environmental services, safety, and welfare. These practices of manual data collection, though effective, are very labor intensive and expensive. It is also subject to human error, and annual readings are not enough to provide sufficient information to find the relation between the water usage during the crop growing season and crop water requirements. Furthermore, these manual readings provide data and information only after the season is over and are not effective to make in-season or real time monitoring or assessments. Taking totalized readings only once a year after the irrigation season does not provide detailed data on how water is used during the crop growing season in relation to crop water requirements. This critically important need to better assess, forecast and manage water resources can be fulfilled by implementing an automated water use monitoring and data collection system which can compile, record, and communicate irrigation flow rate/water withdrawal data, along with critical site-specific drivers of irrigation water use. Recent developments of smart meter technologies that are capable of remotely reading meters in real-time and archiving the records in a central database provides great opportunity to change the way irrigation water use is monitored and documented. The smart meter technology is already being used by public utility providers (electricity, gas, domestic water supply) to reduce the expenses of periodic trips to each physical location to read a meter. The new technologies transmit hourly water consumption data to the city’s billing system by wireless network. This real-time water use information allows city’s water managers to monitor water use and detect leaks and other issues quickly. Water consumers are also able to view their daily water usage data online and learn ways to conserve water.\\n\\nDespite the great potential of smart meter to provide reliable and real-time water-use information, the technology has not been applied in the management of irrigation water use by irrigation and water resources management organizations. Application of this technology in the management of the nation’s irrigation water use has several potential benefits including reduced cost of data collection, documentation and analyses and real-time data for better irrigation management strategies. In addition to irrigation water use data, other information such as rainfall, soil moisture and ETc are required for management and performance evaluation of irrigation systems. When such data are measured by sensors with wireless data transmission capability, it becomes possible to automate the collection, documentation, and storage of the data to a central database. The timely water use information coupled with analysis can give both irrigation managers and farmers better control of water-use. Smart meter technologies allow farmers to view their irrigation information through handheld, mobile and network technologies via wired or wireless platforms, radio frequency, or powerline transmission.\\n\\nIn this research, we demonstrated the use of such an automated system to analyze irrigation analytics across commercial agricultural production fields within an important irrigated crop production region, i.e., Republican River Basin, Nebraska, United States, which is divided into three Natural Resources Districts (NRDs) among which MRNRD is the largest and intensively irrigated. The largest source of irrigation water in the MRNRD is groundwater with 3000+ registered wells, and the area is facing significant challenges associated with water needs and quality. The objectives of this research were to demonstrate the deployment and use of a novel and an automated near real-time water withdrawal and use monitoring and data collection system and decipher the complex irrigator behavior and pattern of irrigation water use in the region. Specifically, critical aspects of regional irrigation are studied such as the start and termination of irrigation season, frequency of the irrigation in a crop growing season, and depth of irrigation water applied. Finally, irrigation water depths directly observed at producer fields were compared and assessed against irrigation requirement estimates obtained using viable and scientific methodologies. The irrigator behaviour in decision making is assessed against both true irrigation requirements as well as water allocation (Moratorium). Such large-scale deployment of technologies and extensive water withdrawal and use analyses on large scale production fields as well as irrigator behaviors with respect to water allocations are unique and have not been studied before. The anticipated benefits from this project are reduced cost of data collection, documentation and analyses; real time data availability for better irrigation management strategies; improvement in groundwater quality from reduced irrigation and reduced chemical leaching potential to water resources; and reduced soil erosion from reduced runoff.\\n\\n2. Materials and methods\\n2.1. Research area\\nThe Republican River Basin is located along the border of Kansas and Nebraska and encompasses portions of three states. The total drainage area sums up to 64,800 km2 of which 31 % is in northeastern Colorado, 30 % in northwestern Kansas, and 39 % in southwestern Nebraska (Fig. 1). The drainage area within Nebraska overlaps with four Natural Resources Districts (NRDs): Upper Republican, Middle Republican, Lower Republican, and Tri-Basin NRD, while smaller areas also overlap with Little Blue and Twin Platte NRDs. The area for this research is the MRNRD. The MRNRD encompasses all of Hayes, Hitchcock, and Red Willow Counties, most of Frontier, and the southern one-third of Lincoln County (Fig. 1). The total land area covered by MRNRD is 9950 km2 (995,332 ha) comprising of 53 % of rangeland and 46 % of cropland. The major crops in this region are maize, winter wheat, sorghum, and soybean. The growing season generally lasts between 150 and 160 days. The major soil types in the area are a Coly-Uly and Colby-Ulysses associations of silt loam texture, silty Hord, McCook, Hobbs and Valentine and Valent sands in the northwestern part. The 30-year normal (1991–2020) annual precipitation and temperature for the region are 546 mm and 10.1 °C, respectively (PRISM, 2021). Over 3000 registered irrigation wells in the MRNRD (Fig. 1) are required to be equipped with a flowmeter. For this research, 31 fields that have well permits were selected for a 3-year pilot assessment distributed across MRNRD. Twentysix fields were irrigated with center pivots, 3 with gravity (surface) and 2 with subsurface drip- irrigation (SDI) (Fig. 1). Geographical details of the research fields are provided in Table 1.\\n\\nFig. 1\\nDownload : Download high-res image (247KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 1.

Instrumentation and data sources\\n2.2.1. Instrumentation and development of irrigation water-use data acquisition system\\nIn this research, all producer collaborators’ fields were named with their respective irrigation method such as center pivot irrigation (P1, P2,…) gravity (furrow) irrigation (G1, G2,…) and subsurface drip irrigation (S1, S2,…) (Table 1) to avoid using actual producers’ names. These field names were also used in the telemetry and online/cloud platforms to protect the identity and privacy of the collaborators. The irrigation water-use data acquisition system was designed to automate the gathering of irrigation water-use and other information such as rainfall, crop type, planting date, ETc and soil moisture data into a central irrigation water use database platform. The system uses the most appropriate and cost effective, yet advanced satellite telemetry/wireless technology for delivering up to date irrigation water flow, soil moisture, ETc, and rainfall data from the sensors installed in the field to a central monitoring computer. The components of the irrigation water use data acquisition system are shown in Picture 1. All research fields were equipped with flowmeters on the irrigation pipelines to measure, record, and communicate irrigation flow data every 15\\u2009min. The telemetry system allows monitoring water withdrawal quantities and enables to set alerts/alarms to indicate high or low water withdrawal, which can be concurrently tracked for each field. The collected data are processed and output via easy-to-understand graphs showing the irrigation water pumped in each farm in relation to water allocation limits, crop water use and average irrigation withdrawals of the neighboring farms. Farmers can login to the system online using a username and password to view their own irrigation water withdrawal data and associated information.\\n\\nPicture 1\\nDownload : Download high-res image (957KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nPicture 1. Components of the irrigation water-use data acquisition system.\\n\\nThe research used the existing totalizer flowmeters (TFM) installed in the research fields. The flowmeters were propeller-type manufactured by McCrometer (Great Plains Meter, Inc., Aurora, NE, USA) and have a measurement accuracy of ±\\u20092 % of discharge and repeatability of ±\\u20090.25 %. To obtain this accuracy of discharge, we ensured that the TFM were installed correctly, following the manufacturer’s specifications. At each selected irrigation well, a TFM was installed inline in a full-flowing, acceptable test section of pipe on the discharge side of the pump where the measurement of water velocity was made (Picture 2). The flowmeter location was in a straight, constant diameter length of pipeline without turbulence to prevent obstructions (elbows, valves, pumps, and changes in pipe diameter) for a certain distance upstream and downstream from the flowmeter installation point. Distances required usually were related to the diameter of the discharge pipe at the measurement location. The desired distance upstream for the flowmeters without a straightening vane installed was 10 pipe diameters and for flowmeters with a straightening vane, it was 5 pipe diameters. To allow automated flowmeter readings, data logging and telemetry transmission, a pulse transmitter unit was installed at the bases of the existing flowmeters (Picture 3). The transmitter unit transmits pulses representing irrigation flow rate (pulse range: 4–20\\u2009mA) to the telemetry unit through a cable. On-site calibration was performed for each installed pulse transmitter unit in each field.\\n\\nPicture 2\\nDownload : Download high-res image (721KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nPicture 2.

Assembled remote telemetry unit, rain gauge and solar panel in the field.\\n\\nThe remote telemetry units (RTUs) used in this data acquisition system was standalone GPRS stations (Model A755 GPRS SDI-12, Adcon Telemetry, Vienna, Austria) (Picture 3). Each station has two input ports and was connected through cables to receive data signals from the flowmeter and from either rain gauges or atmometers (ETgauge) as needed. Data signals are first stored in the memory of an RTU. An RTU has its own intelligence in the form of a built-in microcontroller, which periodically performs several tasks. For example, it interrogates the sensors, stores the measured data and checks the local battery status continuously. RTU is equipped with a GSM modem, which allows for real-time wireless communication with a base station. Reverse communication is also possible from the base station. The stations were configured to record data with 15\\u2009min intervals and set to deliver the recorded data to the telemetry gateway at hourly intervals to provide near real-time data. The power for the unit comes from an internal NiMH battery which is charged using a compact solar panel. Rain gauge (Model RG1 200, McCrometer, Inc., Aurora, NE, USA) that was used is compatible with the RTU and has a capacity to maintain an accuracy of within 2 % of rainfall up to 60\\u2009mm. ETgauge is an ET measurement device in the local field conditions. The electronic version of ETgauge (Model E, ETgauge Company, Loveland, CO, USA) was used. It has a performance accuracy of ±\\u20091 % of evaporated water. The Watermark soil moisture sensors (Irrometer Co., Riverside, CA, USA) were used to measure soil matric potential (kPa) in each field and sensors were connected to Watermark monitor/dataloggers (model 900\\u2009M, Irrometer Co., Riverside, CA, USA) to log soil moisture data on an hourly basis. SMP data were converted to soil water content (%vol) using the soil-water retention curves developed by Irmak, 2019a, Irmak, 2019b for the research area soils for each field.\\n\\nTelemetry Gateway (Model A850, Adcon Telemetry, Austria) was used in the research (Picture 3). It forms the core of the data acquisition system as a base station. The Gateway acts as a network controller and at regular intervals (typically 15\\u2009min, but this can be changed) it requests data via modem from the RTUs in the field network. The Gateway also stores the incoming data in its memory, allowing it to supervise large numbers of RTUs and keep their data for a period of time before data are downloaded to a ProServer for long-term storage in a central database and for processing. One Telemetry Gateway (Model A850) can handle up to 1000 RTU field stations. Communication between the remote telemetry unit and the Telemetry Gateway is through cellular communication system's global system for mobile communication. This data acquisition system is run by the addVANTAGE Pro software (Adcon Telemetry, Vienna, Austria) which controls various functions in the RTUs and the Gateway (Picture 4).

Meteorological data, field-specific measurements of soil matric potential, evaporative demand and precipitation\\nFour agricultural weather stations were selected for the computation of reference and crop evapotranspiration. For this purpose, daily weather data from 2013 to 2015 at Brule Plate Valley, Champion, McCook, and Dickens sites were obtained from the High Plains Regional Climatic Center-Automated Weather Data Network (HPRCC-AWDN). The meteorological variables included in this dataset were maximum and minimum air temperatures, wind speed, relative humidity, and incoming shortwave radiation. The magnitudes of average growing season meteorological variables recorded at each site for the three growing seasons are presented in Table 2. Crop growing season was considered as May 1 to September 20, based on the most common historical planting and harvesting dates in the region.SMP in each field was measured on an hourly basis using Watermark granular matrix sensors installed at four depths in the root zone profile (30, 60, 90 and 120\\u2009cm). ETgauges were installed in five representative fields for site-specific reference ET measurements, designed to simulate ET from plant canopy in a way that closely mimics plant’s resistance to ET (Irmak et al., 2005a, Irmak et al., 2005b). Tipping-bucket rain gauges were also installed in these five representative fields for site specific precipitation data. Geographic Information System (GIS)-based tools were used to record, organize, and analyze these datasets geographically within the research area. The management practices adopted by individual growers which included crop type, acreage and cultivar information (maturity), planting and harvesting dates, seeding rate, tillage practices, fertilizer type and application, crop yield, etc. were obtained via personal communication with the producer partners.\\n\\nTable 2.

Sunil Conference paperFirst Online: 01 November 2022468 AccessesPart of the book series: Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems ((LNNS,volume 516))AbstractThe greenhouse is a structural system used to cultivate a variety of fruits, vegetables, flowers, and other plants that requires special temperature and humidity conditions to flourish. There are numerous issues, ranging from plant growth to maintenance, that requires greenhouse control and monitoring. In addition, various bacterial, viral, or fungal diseases affect the plant leaf, reducing crop productivity drastically. Plant leaf diseases must be identified and treated soon in order to cater to the requirements of a huge population around the world. We offer a systematic model based on CNN for identifying diseases in rice leaves in this research. With the use of a unique dataset containing 2693 images of rice leaf diseases, we developed the system to spot the three most common rice leaf diseases: Brown Spot, hispa, Leaf Blast, and healthy leaves. Our paper’s main goal is to use an effective deep learning framework for disease prediction by making use of leaf images and to create a solution for greenhouse based on IoT to detect problems without the need for human involvement and regulating environmental parameters like humidity, temperature, and soil moisture, as well as perform automatic irrigation of the greenhouse.KeywordsGreenhouseCNN-based modelLeaf diseasesDeep learningAccess provided by University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Download conference paper PDF1 IntroductionTechnological innovations in the sectors of information science and communication have marked their potential for certain applications. In particular, the use of IoT in agriculture is rapidly growing because it provides farmers with a well-controlled and automated farm, improved climatic and crop production forecasts for agriculturists, and a better understanding of the dominating products of the market. In addition, it is a significant achievement in the field of agriculture to automate the prediction of diseases in plants based on their leaf images. Furthermore, crop output and quality are clearly influenced by the early and timely detection of plant diseases. Given the widespread farming of a vast variety of agricultural products, perhaps an agronomist and pathologist may fail to spot illnesses in vegetation by glancing at diseased leaves. Farmers in rural locations may have to commute significant distances to obtain advice from professionals, and this is both cumbersome and overpriced. For the treatment and classification of plant diseases, farmers and agriculturalists get benefited from the excellent precision and efficiency of automated computing systems. Several types of feature sets can be used to classify plant ailments using machine learning. The most typical model parameters among them are traditional handcrafted and deep learning-oriented abilities. Before efficiently and successfully extracting features, pre-processing is required, which includes picture enhancement, shade alteration, and segmentation. Different classifiers might be employed after feature extraction. Deep learning-based algorithms are by far the most potent approach for dynamically obtaining decisive and discriminative features, especially CNNs. Deep learning is made up of several convolution layers that reflect learning characteristics from records and data. Plant disease detection can be achieved by the usage of a deep learning model.By providing adequate temperature and aeration, greenhouse provides regulated safe housing and a controlled environment for crop production. Plants in open-air culture have slowed growth, which extends the time it takes for them to produce. This can be greatly reduced by adopting a greenhouse system, as it allows the plant life to retain moisture in its environment as well as within the soil. Farmers used to have to visit their entire field on a regular or irregular basis to ensure the well-being of their farm, which often included turning on/off motors to ensure that their plants were watered. Due to the effort required to turn off the engine, the motor pumps are sometimes left running for longer than necessary, resulting in water blockage, root decay, and oxygen deprivation in the soil. As a result, through the collection and interpretation of observed statistics and decision-making, the Internet of things elevates agriculture beyond traditional agricultural approaches. This procedure may also control a variety of activities in an automated greenhouse system, assisting farmers in a number of ways and saving both time and energy while enhancing productivity. The contemporary smart greenhouse system research and development are centered on the innovative integration of greenhouse tracking, notifications, automation, and analytical techniques. The proposed system framework is divided into two components, i.e.; firstly, the system uses deep learning algorithms to analyze plant disease detection. Various varieties of rice diseases have been found in rice fields, which include rice Leaf Blast, hispa, and Brown Spot. Secondly, an autonomous tracking system that regulates humidity, temperature, and moisture content of soil and data is recorded and stored in the cloud, as well as providing smart irrigation control based on the sensor input.2 Literature SurveyWe have discussed the various studies in the existing research field in this section. In paper [1], the researchers utilized tomato leaf images to diagnose diseases, segmented diseased portions, and used geometric and histogram-based features of the leaf and also classified by using a support vector machine classifier with polynomial kernels. Kaur et al. [2] have used various color and texture features to identify three different soybean diseases. In [3], the authors have identified plant leaves and their diseases by using a feed-forward network and backpropagation method.In a tomato greenhouse in Russia, the author [4] employed the idea of IoT deployment. The major plan is to determine the greenhouse monitoring component as well as the tomato growth rate; however, they also obtain other statistics such as sensory data, data analytics, monitoring systems, graphics, and insights.In [5], the author has experimented with the detection of plant disease at an early stage by implementing the case of IoT infrastructure. It consists of a Raspberry Pi processor with a Web camera interface for image processing and recognition. Image recognition techniques, such as OpenCV, are used for disease detection classification.In the paper [6], to retrieve the color-texture properties of apple patches, the author used the K-means clustering approach to separate the diseased sections and integrate the global color histogram, color coherence vector, and local binary pattern. There were three different forms of apple illnesses discovered using the combined local binary pattern and improved support vector machine (SVM).In [7], early blight, late blight, leaf mildew, and leaf spot are the four tomato leaf diseases addressed by the author and used a Bayesian discriminant and step-wise discriminant principal component analysis technique for extracting 18 attributes from tomato leaf spot images, including color, texture, and shape information.Even after this research, there are still deficiencies and limitations with traditional image processing technology. They are time and labor-intensive, and they rely significantly on artificial feature extraction. As a result, achieving intuitive, efficient, and precise plant leaf disease identification is critical. Deep learning has made more progress in recent years. The convolutional neural networks are becoming the preferred method [8]. CNN has risen to prominence as the most popular image identification classifier, demonstrating excellent abilities in image recognition and analysis [9]. Based on the leaf vein patterns, the deep learning approach was first introduced in plant recognition [10]. Leguminous plant species are classified as white beans, red beans, or soybean by CNN using three to six layers.Our project also emphasizes the monitoring, reporting, automating, and data processing elements of the greenhouse. So further discussion includes existing technology based on this. There has been researched cited [11, 12] in order to appreciate the importance and urgent necessity for greenhouses in agriculture. It justifies the distant future advantages of the greenhouse, significantly when it comes to global warming. Because there is a restricted amount of land available, it leads to economical solutions that result in better production, fewer pests, and reduced weather variability. For illustration [13], a comprehensive study was published to represent different humidity and temperature ranges for a variety of agricultural crops in a greenhouse.Likewise, the method has been assessed and proved a way to improve agricultural productivity [14]. Reference [15] focuses primarily on the greenhouse’s automation aspect, providing an automatic irrigation structure for the greenhouse which reduces human interaction in its functioning. Similarly, [16] uses Raspberry Pi and Arduino to analyze, manage, and coordinate various factors that control crop productivity, including humidity, CO2 concentration, illumination, moisture content, and temperature.3 MethodologyThis research presents a comprehensive approach to build a smart greenhouse that includes features such as plant disease prediction using deep learning, monitoring, alerting, memory optimization, and irrigation automation. The disease prediction deep learning models were trained and evaluated using Internet picture data gathering. Humidity, temperature, and soil moisture level data are gathered using a combination of sensor data. When the surrounding parameters differ from the norm, the microcontroller notifies the farmer. The data from continuous factor monitoring are saved to a cloud server, which saves memory. The irrigation motor is controlled by the microcontroller depending on the inputs from the sensors. The proposed methodology’s workflow is depicted in Fig. 1.Fig. 1Overview of the systemFull size imageFigure 2 depicts a block diagram of the proposed system that describes the elements and their relationships. The proposed framework is split into two subsystems, each with its own set of capabilities:Fig. 2Block illustrationFull size imageDisease prediction system.Ambient condition monitoring and automated irrigation system.3.1 Disease Prediction SystemThis section outlines how we plan to identify diseases in rice leaves. The entire process is divided into several parts, beginning with the formation of a new trained set of data, followed by the creation of a new CNN framework, deep features are extracted for classifier training, and ultimately the identification of diseases of rice leaf.Dataset: We have collected 2693 original RGB-colored images from the Internet [17]. It contains healthy leaves, disease-affected leaves—Brown Spot, hispa, and Leaf Blast images. Figure 3 depicts an example of each kind of rice leaf disease. Different sizes of images were utilized in all of the trials in this research to examine the performance of recognizing rice leaf diseases. For example, Brown Spot healthy, hispa, and Leaf Blast samples are shown in Fig. 3a, b, c, and d, respectively.Fig. 3Rice leaf diseases: a Brown Spot; b healthy leaf; c hispa; d Leaf BlastFull size imageRice Leaf Disease Recognition Model Based on CNN: For identifying rice leaf diseases, we present a customized CNN-based model. We aimed to design a ten-layer model. As illustrated in Fig. 4, it consists of an input layer, three convolution layers (Conv1, Conv2, Conv3), three pooling layers (Pooling1, Pooling2, Pooling3), two dense layers (Dense1, Dense2), and an output layer.Fig. 4Our rice leaf disease detection model based on CNNFull size imageInput Layer: The input layer of our model is given an RGB image with dimensions of w0×h0 where w0 and h0 are the image’s width and height, respectively.Convolution Layer. A convolution layer’s main purpose is to transfer local conjunctions of features from the previous layers to a feature map. Three convolution layers and various filters are used in our model to create the output feature maps. Consequently, these map record in which part of the image the characteristics occurs and also how it meets the requirements of filtration system. As an outcome, every filter is adequately trained for the number of data it receives, and then, specific properties in the image are being identified by each filter. The following equation is used to compute the output feature maps in this layer:$$ Z_{i}^{l} = b_{i}^{l } + \\\\mathop \\\\sum \\\\limits_{j = 1}^{{n^{l - 1} }} K_{i,j}^{l} * Z_{j}^{l - 1} $$where \\\\(Z_{i}^{l}\\\\) and \\\\( Z_{j}^{l - 1}\\\\) depict the features map of input and output, l depicts the layer \\\\( b_{i}^{l }\\\\) is a bias, \\\\(K_{i,j}^{l}\\\\) signifies the filter, nl−1 signifies the quantity of filters. To easily grasp complex data relationships, we use the ReLU nonlinear activation function. We employ three convolution layers in our model: Conv1, Conv2, and Conv3. For each convolution layer, we used certain filters, i.e., we have used 64, 32, and 16 as filters for Conv1, Conv2, and Conv3, respectively. The parameters of the model of these layers are displayed in Fig. 5 obtained as an output of code.Fig. 5Relevant parameters of leaf disease detection modelFull size imagePooling Layer: Pooling is important in our model since it reduces variance and computation complexity, which means there are fewer parameters to learn. By downsampling, the spatial information, and the feature map’s parameters are reduced. As a result, the remaining procedures are carried out on summarized characteristics, which increases the model’s resistance to alterations at positions where image attributes have been found in the image. The three pooling layers we employ in our model are Pooling1, Pooling2, and Pooling3.Dense Layer: The result of the last pooling layer is compressed into a 1D vector. Then, it is passed into a dense layer that is fully connected. This layer generates a 512-dimensional vector V, then it is transmitted into a second connected dense layer which produces a 4-dimensional vector V′.Output Layer: Using the softmax activation function, this layer gradually normalizes the dense layer output V′ and provides a probability distribution for each of the rice leaf disease categories.Rice Leaf Diseases Model Training and Classification: In our plant leaf disease prediction algorithm based on CNN, deeper aspects of disorders of rice leaf are recovered using our customized CNN-based framework. Every layer’s activation transforms the detailed characteristics of the original leaf disease image into a much more conceptual representation and synthesizes the key aspects as the image advances through the deeper levels of the system. Our model’s softmax layer is then used to classify more and more reliable data as an attribute. In the convolutional, pooling, and dense layers, we transfer pictures in groups to train and improve the system configuration, culminating in a 1×512 vector that perfectly describes the properties. Following that, these features are transmitted to a second dense layer, which generates a 1×4 vector. This vector is then used by the softmax layer to categorize a plant leaf disease image into the appropriate category. Before validating the system and its relevant attributes with a collection of evaluation images, we transfer the images for training across a number of epochs.3.2 Ambient Condition Monitoring and Automated Irrigation System1.As an input, data from sensors like DHT11 and temperature sensor is used.2.DHT11 is easy to use and it is a low-cost, digital humidity, and temperature sensor. It is simple to use; however, gathering information takes a few seconds.3.The atmospheric moisture content of the soil was recorded using a soil moisture sensor. The moisture content of the soil uses capacitance to compute the dielectric permittivity of the extracellular environment.4.It calculates the amount of moisture lost in the soil over time owing to evaporation and plant uptake.5.The LCD display will also show the current temperature, humidity, and soil moisture level.6.The Arduino UNO receives the sensor inputs. It works through a program done in Arduino IDE.7.The sensed data is saved in the ThingSpeak cloud using the ThingSpeak write API, which saves memory. We utilized an ESP8266 WIFI module to link Arduino to ThingSpeak.8.On the basis of moisture level followed by motor working status, the status of the motor on/off is displayed on the LCD in this system. And on the basis of the moisture content, whether it is above or below the threshold value set by us, the water pump activates and switches on or off.9.This relay board unit is in charge of controlling the microcontroller development board’s increased current demands. The bc547 transistor can switch approximately 7 A and shields the input unit from a relay module and is safely operated by it. A freewheeling diode is being used to safeguard the microcontroller against relay kickback.4 Results and Analysis4.1 Model Training ResultsEnvironment: The described model has been deployed using the Keras and TensorFlow packages in a Jupyter notebook.Datasets for Training and Testing: We examined 2693 RGB-colored photos of healthy rice leaves as well as three typical rice leaf diseases: Leaf Blast, Brown Spot, and hispa. We utilize 70% of the data for training the system and 30% of the data for testing the model (Table 1).Table 1 Datasets for training and testingFull size tableImpact of Epochs. Under default parameters, a customizable amount of epochs have been used to train the proposed model. Here, we have applied epochs up to 12, and hence, the accuracy went up to 91.94% while validation accuracy is 48%.4.2 Disease Prediction ResultsIn the complete dataset of 2693 photos, 70% of the photos are being used to train the classifier, with the remaining 30% being used for testing. Because a bigger database was used, a lesser percentage of data was needed for testing datasets, and a significant amount of data could be used for training with this method. The suggested system’s effectiveness is evaluated using four types of rice leaf disease pictures in terms of disease prediction, viz. healthy, Brown Spot, hispa, and Leaf Blast. Figures 6 and 7 show the detected output.Fig. 6Healthy leaf detectedFull size imageFig. 7Hispa (leaf disease) detectedFull size image4.3 Results of Environmental Condition Monitoring1.The tracked and recorded values of temperature (T) and humidity (H) are collected on a cloud server of ThingSpeak, as depicted in Figs. 11 and 12. These variables can be constantly monitored even from a remote location.2.Temperature, humidity, and soil moisture level output are also shown in LCD and keep updating in every 2 s as shown in Figs. 8 and 9.Fig. 8Temperature monitoring resultsFull size imageFig. 9Humidity monitoring resultsFull size image3.The threshold value of moisture content has been preset at 200, and if the dryness reaches 200 or above, the irrigation motor is activated; however, if the dryness falls below 200, the irrigation motor is switched off as shown in Figs. 10 and 11.Fig. 10Display shows the temperature T, humidity H, and soil moisture M, when M<200 pump offFull size imageFig. 11Display shows the temperature T, humidity H, and soil moisture M, when M>200 pump onFull size image5 Conclusion and Future ScopeThe idea of this research study is effectively implemented as leaf disease detection using deep learning and tracking of environmental parameters and irrigation systems within the greenhouse environment using IoT. We designed a CNN-based framework that was customized to our needs which can identify healthy leaves and three common rice leaf diseases. The developed findings are highly accurate and utilize memory efficiency.Despite its increased accuracy, by testing the model on a variety of datasets from different regions, we hope to increase its dependability and adaptability. When there are images of rice leaf disease with complex backdrops, we will work on classifying them. In future, we may be able to place many cameras at different locations, resulting in a considerably larger database and aiding in the refinement of the results. We can also provide the name of the pesticide that is required for the disease that has been discovered. Regarding the future implementation of the monitoring greenhouse system, more sensors might be added in order to improve management. As an example, to detect smoke and gases, we may install an MQ2 smoke sensor, an LDR, and inlet and exhaust fans to monitor light intensity and aeration, respectively.ReferencesMokhtar U, Ali MAS, Hassanien AE, Hefny H (2015) Identifying two of tomatoes leaf viruses using support vector machine.

However, the impact of such measures on rice yield and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, especially nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, needs to be further clarified to ensure that agronomic practices save water, conserve soil, and reduce GHG emissions. Therefore, we explored the effects of mild AWD irrigation combined with on-site rice straw recycling on N2O emissions and rice yield through rice pot experiments. This experiment included 2 irrigation methods (continuous flooding (CF) irrigation and mild AWD irrigation), 2 nitrogen (N) application levels (0 and 225kgNha−1) and 2 rice straw return levels (0 and 9000kgha−1), for a total of 10 treatments, and each treatment had 3 replicates. The 15N-urea and 15N-S were added to the soil. The results showed that N2O emissions were primarily affected by urea application and irrigation methods, with urea application being most important. Compared with CF irrigation, mild AWD irrigation increased cumulative N2O emissions, with an average increase of 28.8%. In addition, adding rice straw to mild AWD irrigation further stimulated N2O emissions by 18.1%. Under the condition of urea application, compared with CF irrigation, mild AWD irrigation increased the yield-scaled N2O emissions by 17.9%, and the addition of rice straw further promoted the yield-scaled N2O emissions under mild AWD irrigation by 17.4% but reduced the global warming potential (GWP) (methane (CH4)+N2O) by 62.9%. Under the condition of urea application, compared with CF irrigation, mild AWD irrigation reduced the uptake of soil-derived N and aboveground biomass of rice but did not reduce rice yield. Therefore, mild AWD irrigation combined with rice straw return may be a promising agronomic method to maintain rice yield, reduce GHGs, and protect or improve soil fertility.Download & linksArticle (2197 KB)Full-text XMLSupplement (329 KB)BibTeXEndNoteShareHow to cite.

More than 135×106ha of rice are cultivated worldwide, and approximately 90% of paddy fields are submerged (J. Wang et al., 2017). Feeding a growing population under water scarcity will be a major challenge to Asia's food security in the coming decades (Lampayan et al., 2015). In China, more than 60% of freshwater resources are consumed by rice cultivation every year, which represents a great waste of freshwater and causes many environmental problems, such as nonpoint source pollution, eutrophication, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Liao et al., 2020). Therefore, it is urgent to explore new methods for managing paddy field fertilization that can ensure high rice yield and reduced water waste and pollution.Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation is an effective water-conserving irrigation method that can save approximately 23% of freshwater resources compared with CF irrigation (Bouman and Tuong, 2001; Chu et al., 2014). There are usually two approaches to AWD irrigation: severe AWD irrigation (soil water potential ≥-30±5kPa) and mild AWD irrigation (soil water potential ≥-15±5kPa) (Zhou et al., 2017). Severe AWD irrigation could reduce rice yield by 22.6% due to water stress, but under mild AWD irrigation, rice yield can be stable or slightly increased (Carrijo et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2017). Therefore, mild AWD irrigation may offer a more promising paddy field management model. Previous studies have shown that AWD irrigation can significantly reduce CH4 emissions but considerably promotes N2O emissions, while global warming potential (GWP) mitigation is dependent on the magnitude of the increase in the release of N2O (Lagomarsino et al., 2016; Liang et al., 2017; Kritee et al., 2018; Tan et al., 2018). Therefore, exploring the impact of mild AWD irrigation on GHG emissions, especially N2O, is conducive to reducing paddy field emissions and maximizing agricultural and environmental benefits.Long-term cultivation without organic matter supplementation leads to serious degradation of cultivated land and reduction in soil organic matter (SOM) content (Zhou et al., 2021), which is not conducive to rice production and sustainable agricultural development (Chen et al., 2016). Straw (S) return to the field is a valuable measure for improving SOM (Huang et al., 2021), and it is beneficial for reducing the environmental pollution caused by burning straw or discarding it randomly (Wang et al., 2018). In addition, rice straw return may cause changes in paddy field GHG emissions (Naser et al., 2007; Ye and Horwath, 2017; Sun et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2021), N-use efficiency (Liu et al., 2021), and rice yield (Chen et al., 2016; Ku et al., 2019). Although there have been many studies on mild paddy AWD irrigation or rice straw return, few studies have focused on the effects of mild AWD irrigation combined with rice straw return on rice cultivation. Under the conventional fertilization mode, whether mild AWD irrigation combined with rice straw return can achieve the optimal goals of water saving, yield increase and reduction in GHG emissions has remained unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of mild AWD irrigation combined with rice straw return on N2O emissions and rice yield in rice cultivation and to explore the supply of N to rice growth from the soil, urea and rice straw using 15N labeling technology. Our initial hypotheses were as follows: (1) mild AWD irrigation would promote N2O emissions in rice cultivation; and (2) mild AWD irrigation would maintain or promote rice yield.2Materials and methods2.1Experimental setupA pot experiment was conducted in an open greenhouse at the Shenyang Experimental Station of the Institute of Applied Ecology, Liaoning Province, China (43∘32′N, 123∘23′E) from 17 June to 27 October 2020. The test soil was an Alfisol with a total C content of 16.01gkg−1 and a total N content of 1.36gkg−1.The pot experiment used a random block design, including 30 pots (30cm diameter×20cm height). This experiment included two irrigation methods, two N application levels and two rice straw return levels, with three replicates of each combination, for a total of 30 rice pots (urea and straw were labeled with 15N, respectively). The two irrigation methods were continuous flooding (CF) irrigation and mild AWD irrigation. The CF irrigation maintained a water level depth of approximately 3–5cm throughout the rice-growing season. Mild AWD irrigation water management in the first 7d was consistent with CF irrigation and was allowed to evaporate under monitoring; when the soil negative pressure gauge reached −15kPa, it was sub-flooded to a depth of 3–5cm again and was then naturally allowed to dry again. This step was repeated until harvest. The CF and mild AWD irrigation were halted 2 weeks before harvest. Nitrogen was applied at 0kgNha−1 (control check (CK) and rice straw (15S)) and 225kgNha−1 (106.13mgkg−1 dry soil) (urea (15U), urea+rice straw (U15S) and urea+rice straw (15US)). The abundance of urea 15N was 10.20%. Urea was applied three times: base fertilizer 40% (17 June), tiller topdressing 30% (4 August) and heading topdressing 30% (25 August). Rice straw return was applied at 0kgha−1 (CK and 15U) and 9000kgha−1 (4.25gkg−1 dry soil) (15S, U15S and 15US). The total N content of unlabeled rice straw was 0.72%, and the isotope abundance of 15N was 0.59%. The total N content of labeled rice straw was 0.73%, and the 15N isotope abundance was 22.94%. The rice straw was ground and applied together with the base fertilizer. Phosphate fertilizer was superphosphate (150kgP2O5ha−1), and potassium fertilizer was potassium chloride (185kgK2Oha−1) as a one-time application of basic fertilizer. Every pot was filled with 10.51kg (9kg dry soil) of sieved (2mm) fresh soil. Two hills of rice were planted in each pot. At maturity, the rice yield and aboveground biomass were recorded after being oven-dried (105∘C for 0.5h and 60∘C for 12h).2.2Soil sample collection and analysisAt the stages of regreening, tillering, jointing, booting, filling and maturity, five points were randomly selected from the 0–10cm soil layer of each pot and mixed. The soil NH+4-N and NO-3-N were extracted with 2molL−1 KCl solution (Wu et al., 2019), filtered and analyzed with a continuous flow analyzer (AA3, Bran+Luebbe, Germany). The extraction of soil 15N-NH+4-N followed Yu et al. (2020). Soil microbial biomass N (MBN) was fumigated with chloroform, extracted with 0.5molL−1 K2SO4 (soil:solution=5g:20mL) (Joergensen and Mueller, 1996), and determined by a total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer (Elementar vario TOC Analyzer, Germany). The soil 15N-NH+4-N content, 15N-MBN and 15N of rice aboveground biomass were determined by a stable isotope ratio mass spectrometer (253 MAT, Thermo Finnigan, Germany).2.3Gas sampling and calculationThe static chamber method was used to determine the N2O flux (J. L. Li et al., 2018). The static chamber with a top seal made of transparent plexiglass consisted of two parts, namely, the base and the gas-collecting chamber. The base had a diameter of 31cm, a groove in the middle, and a height of 10cm. The gas-collecting chamber had a diameter of 30cm with a height of 70cm. A small fan and a thermometer were installed in the gas-collecting chamber. Nitrous oxide (N2O) was collected every 2d in the first week after fertilization or irrigation and every 7d during other periods; N2O was sampled at 08:00–11:00LT each sampling day. Every pot was sealed with water when N2O was collected. Three gas samples were collected at 0, 30 and 60min after the chamber was airtight, and N2O was collected with a 50mL injector and then injected into 200mL gasbags.The N2O concentration was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890B, Gas Chromatograph, Delaware, USA). The calculation of N2O fluxes was as follows (J. L. Li et al., 2018):F=ρ×h×dc/dt×273/(273+T),where F is the N2O flux (µgm−2h−1); ρ is the N2O standard-state density (1.964kgm−3); h is the chamber height above the soil (m); c is the N2O concentration; dc/dtis the slope of the N2O concentration curve, estimated using a linear regression model (Vitale et al., 2017); 273 is the gas constant; and T is the average air temperature inside the chamber during N2O collection (∘C).Cumulative N2O emissions (CE) were calculated using the following formula according to Wang et al. (2011):CE(kgN2Oha-1)=n∑i=1(Fi+Fi+12)(ti+1-ti)×24×10-2,where i is the various sampling times, t is the sampling date, n is the total measurement time and 10−2 is the conversion factor.The contribution of 15N markers to NH+4-N and MBN as well as the calculation of the N source of the aboveground biomass of rice followed Ma et al. (2015). Yield-scaled N2O was calculated as the ratio between N2O and rice yield (J. L. Li et al., 2018).2.4Statistical analysisAll analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics 16.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, USA). One-way ANOVA was conducted to test the treatment effects with Duncan's test. Significance was set at P<0.05. Univariate analysis of variance was used to analyze the response of cumulative N2O emissions to irrigation method, N level and rice straw application (Table 2). Tables and figures were prepared with Excel 2016 (Microsoft Corp., USA) and Origin 8 (Origin Lab Corp., USA), respectively. The data in the figures and tables are the average value ±standard error.3Results3.1N2O fluxThree higher N2O flux peaks appeared after basal fertilizer and two topdressing treatments (Fig. 1), and the N2O flux peak after basal fertilizer application was significantly larger than the last two peaks. After basal fertilizer was applied, the N2O flux peaks of CF irrigation and mild AWD irrigation were similar. After the first topdressing, the N2O flux peak of mild AWD irrigation was significantly greater than that of CF irrigation, approximately 1.4 and 9.1 times under the U and US treatments, respectively. In contrast, the N2O flux peak of CF irrigation after the second topdressing was 3.5 and 1.6 times higher than that of mild AWD irrigation under the U and US treatments, respectively. In addition to the above three peaks, the N2O flux of CF irrigation was close to zero, and mild AWD irrigation had a lower flux peak with alternating wet and dry conditions. The flux of N2O ranged from −103.93 to 2770.50µgm−2h−1. The N2O flux appeared negative in the late stage of rice growth. The N2O fluxes of CF irrigation and mild AWD irrigation were similar in the later stage of rice growth, indicating that drainage had little effect on it. During the entire rice growth cycle, the N2O flux of the CK and S treatments was low. There were significant differences in the peak N2O fluxes between the different treatments. Compared with CK, the application of S alone significantly promoted the N2O flux on the first day after CF irrigation and mild AWD irrigation. Compared with U, the addition of S in CF irrigation reduced the N2O flux, while the addition of S in mild AWD irrigation increased the N2O flux.Figure 1Effects of different treatments on nitrous oxide (N2O) flux. Bars represent standard errors (n=3), the same below.Download3.2Soil NH+4-N, NO-3-N and MBN concentrationsThe soil NH+4-N, NO-3-N, and MBN concentrations varied with the growing stage of rice (Figs. 2a, c and 3a). The soil NH+4-N concentration first increased and then decreased. The NH+4-N concentration under CF irrigation and mild AWD irrigation was low in the late rice growth period (Fig. 2a). The concentration of NO-3-N in CF-irrigated soil showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing and was at a low level in the later growth period of rice, while the concentration of NO-3-N in mild AWD irrigation showed a trend of first decreasing and then increasing, with repeated decreases and increases (Fig. 2c). The concentration of MBN in CF-irrigated soil first decreased and then increased and then decreased to a lower level, while the concentration of MBN in mild AWD-irrigated soil decreased with the growth stage of rice (Fig. 3a).Figure 2Changes in soil ammonium nitrogen (NH+4-N) concentration (a), the contribution of 15N markers to NH+4-N (b), and changes in soil nitrate nitrogen (NO-3-N) concentration (c) during the growth period of rice (n=3).DownloadFigure 3Changes in the concentration of microbial biomass N (MBN) (a) in the soil during the growth period of rice and the contribution of 15N markers to MBN (b) (n=3).DownloadThere were significant differences in the NH+4-N, NO-3-N, and MBN concentrations between the different treatments. In CF irrigation and mild AWD irrigation, the U treatment had a higher NH+4-N concentration in the early stage of rice growth, while the other treatments had no significant difference, but as rice grew, the NH+4-N concentration of the US treatment increased, which was significantly greater than that of the U, S and CK treatments (Fig. 2a). In CF irrigation, the NO-3-N concentration of the U treatment was slightly higher than that of the other treatments, and all treatments had little variance. In mild AWD irrigation, the NO-3-N concentration of the US treatment was significantly higher than that of the U, S and CK treatments. The U treatment had a higher NO-3-N concentration than the S and CK treatments in the later stage of rice growth (Fig. 2c). The US treatment in CF irrigation and mild AWD irrigation had the highest MBN concentration during the growth period of rice (Fig. 3a).Figure 2b shows that the NH+4-N in CF irrigation and mild AWD irrigation mainly came from urea rather than rice straw, and the combined application of urea and rice straw further promoted the release of NH+4-N from urea. Regardless of CF irrigation or mild AWD irrigation, rice straw N was difficult to utilize by microorganisms in the first year under single rice straw application, but the combined application of rice straw and urea significantly promoted the utilization of rice straw N by microorganisms. The application of urea combined with rice straw may be more easily utilized by microorganisms than urea applied alone (Fig. 3b).3.3Sources of aboveground biomass N in riceAs shown in Fig. 4, under CF irrigation and mild AWD irrigation, compared with CK, a single application of rice straw did not increase the aboveground N absorption of rice, while the U and US treatments significantly promoted the aboveground N absorption of rice. Under mild AWD irrigation, the US treatment reduced N uptake in rice shoots compared with the U treatment. The U and US treatments under CF irrigation promoted the N uptake of the aboveground rice more than those under mild AWD irrigation.Figure 4The source of nitrogen in the aboveground biomass of rice at the maturity stage (n=3). CF: continuous flooding irrigation, AWD: mild alternate wetting and drying irrigation, Soil-N: soil-derived nitrogen, U-N: urea-derived nitrogen, S-N: Rice straw-derived nitrogen. Different capital letters indicate significant differences in total nitrogen uptake of rice above ground (P<0.05), and different lowercase letters indicate significant differences in soil-nitrogen supply (P<0.05).DownloadWith different irrigation methods, the effects of urea and rice straw addition on the N absorption of the aboveground rice were varied. Compared with the CK and S treatments, the U and US treatments under CF irrigation significantly promoted the absorption of soil-N by rice, while only the S and U treatments had significant differences under mild AWD irrigation. Compared with mild AWD irrigation, the U and US treatments under CF irrigation significantly promoted the absorption of soil-N by rice. Regardless of the irrigation and fertilization method, the soil was the main source of N in the aboveground parts of rice, followed by urea and finally rice straw (Fig. 4).3.4Cumulative N2O emissions, rice agronomic properties and yield-scaled N2O emissionsIn addition to the CK treatment, compared with CF irrigation, mild AWD irrigation significantly promoted the accumulation of N2O during the growth period of rice, with an average increase of 28.8% (Table 1). Under CF irrigation, there was no significant difference in the accumulation of N2O between S and CK or between US and U. However, the addition of rice straw under mild AWD irrigation significantly increased the accumulation of N2O by 18.1% (Table 1). Compared with the CK and S treatments, the U and US treatments significantly promoted cumulative N2O emissions under the two irrigation modes. As shown in Table 2, irrigation methods, N application level, and rice straw return affected cumulative N2O emissions, of which the N application level had the greatest impact. The interaction between irrigation level and N fertilizer or rice straw significantly affected cumulative N2O emissions.Table 1Effects of different treatments on cumulative nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, rice aboveground biomass, rice yield and yield-scaled N2O emissions. The values denote means±standard errors (n=3). Different lowercase letters indicate significant differences (P<0.05).Download Print Version | Download XLSXAs shown in Table 1, compared with CF irrigation, mild AWD irrigation significantly reduced rice aboveground biomass under US treatment but had no effect on other treatments. Regardless of whether CF irrigation or mild AWD irrigation was applied, there was no significant difference in the rice aboveground biomass between S and CK or between US and U. Compared with the CK and S treatments, the U and US treatments significantly promoted the rice aboveground biomass under the two irrigation modes. Irrigation level had no effect on rice yield under all treatments. Regardless of CF irrigation or mild AWD irrigation, rice yield under the U and US treatments was significantly higher than that under the CK and S treatments, but there was no difference between the former two and the latter two.In addition to the CK treatment, compared with CF irrigation, mild AWD irrigation significantly promoted yield-scaled N2O emissions during the rice growth period. Under urea application conditions, compared with CF irrigation, mild AWD irrigation increased yield-scale N2O emissions by 17.9%, and the addition of rice straw further promoted yield-scale N2O emissions by 17.4% under mild AWD irrigation conditions (Table 1). Regardless of CF irrigation or mild AWD irrigation, yield-scaled N2O emissions under the U and US treatments were significantly higher than those under the CK and S treatments. Rice straw addition had no effect on the yield-scaled N2O emissions under CF irrigation but significantly increased the yield-scaled N2O emissions under mild AWD irrigation.4Discussion4.1Effects of irrigation methods, N levels and rice straw return on N2O emissionsN2O emissions are significantly affected by water-filled pores and mineral N (NH+4-N and NO-3-N) content (Allen et al., 2010). The N2O emission peak in CF irrigation occurred only after N application, while mild AWD irrigation caused other N2O emission peaks, which might have been caused by the change in soil moisture conditions by mild AWD irrigation (Zhou et al., 2020). The peak of N2O after fertilization may be because a large amount of N application increases the soil inorganic-N concentration (Fig. 2a and c), which in turn promotes the generation of N2O, which comes from the denitrification process (L. Wang et al., 2017; Yano et al., 2014). During the denitrification process, it is easier for microorganisms to use NO-3-N as an electron acceptor (Fig. 2c), which affects the reduction process of N2O, resulting in an increase in the ratio of N2O/N2in the denitrification products (Pérez et al., 2000). Our results showed a negative N2O emission flux at the later stage of rice growth, which may be due to the decrease in surface soil N2O concentration due to the strengthening of the N2O reduction process or the weakening of the N2O diffusion process in the soil profile, which allowed atmospheric N2O to diffuse back into the soil (Chapuis-Lydie et al., 2007). Mild AWD irrigation promoted cumulative N2O emissions by 28.8% on average, which was as proposed in our Hypothesis 1. Similar results were found in previous studies, which may be due to the increased N2O produced by nitrification and denitrification due to water-level alternation (Liang et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2020) and temperature change (Wu et al., 2019) of mild AWD irrigation. To reduce N2O emissions from paddy fields, researchers generally regulate N2O production by optimizing N management (Liang et al., 2017), applying inhibitors to control the N supply rate of N fertilizers (Wu et al., 2019). In both CF and mild AWD irrigation, there was no obvious N2O emission peak at the later growth stage of rice, which may have been due to the decrease in soil inorganic-N content (Fig. 2a and c) and microbial biomass (Fig. 3a).Compared with CK and S, N fertilizer application (U and US) significantly increased cumulative N2O emissions and was the most notable factor in N2O generation (Table 2), mainly because N fertilizer application provided sufficient substrates for soil nitrification and denitrification to generate N2O (Fiedler et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2021). The peak of N2O emissions after base fertilizer application was larger than that after two topdressings, which might have been due to a higher N application rate and simultaneous nitrification and denitrification during the initial flooding (Mathieu et al., 2006; L. Wang et al., 2017). The peak of N2O emissions after the two topdressing treatments with CF irrigation was similar, while the peak of N2O emissions after the first topdressing treatment with mild AWD irrigation was significantly larger than that following the second topdressing treatment. This may be because the soil environment (temperature, moisture, etc.) changed little during long-term flooding under CF irrigation (Lagomarsino et al., 2016; Verhoeven et al., 2018; Congreves et al., 2019), while the variations in the soil environment of the two topdressings under mild AWD irrigation changed the utilization of fertilizer N by microorganisms (Fig. 3b). Therefore, reducing the amount of the first topdressing under mild AWD irrigation and maintaining flooding for approximately 1 week after fertilization may benefit N2O reduction (Liao et al., 2020). The negative value of N2O emissions appeared at the later stage of rice growth, indicating that the paddy field could also become a sink for N2O (van Groenigen et al., 2015), which might be caused by the lack of N supply at the later stage. Increasing the second topdressing might be beneficial for alleviating N deficiency (Liao et al., 2020).Table 2Cumulative nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in response to irrigation method, nitrogen level and straw returning. Significant treatment effects within a main category (P<0.05) were indicated by * and *** indicated significant treatment effects within a main category (P<0.001).Download Print Version | Download XLSXUnlike the CF irrigation, the addition of rice straw under mild AWD irrigation conditions promoted N2O emissions (Table 1), probably because the alternation of wet and dry conditions promoted the decomposition of rice straw (Andren et al., 1993; Buchen et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2016), which was beneficial to the growth of microorganisms (Fig. 3a), thus promoting the production of N2O (Said-Pullicino et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2021). In addition, compared with U and S, US promoted microbial absorption of urea and rice straw N (Fig. 3b), which also proved that US treatment was more conducive to the growth of microorganisms.4.2Effects of irrigation methods, N levels and rice straw return on rice production and yield-scaled N2O emissionsThe change in irrigation method did not cause differences in rice yield (Table 1), but under the US treatment, mild AWD irrigation significantly reduced the aboveground biomass of rice and the uptake of soil N by rice (Table 1 and Fig. 4), which was consistent with our Hypothesis 2. Previous studies have also shown that mild AWD irrigation can stabilize or increase rice yield. This may be because mild AWD irrigation can promote the transport of nutrients from stems and leaves to grains during the reproductive growth stage of rice while inhibiting ineffective tillering and increasing the number of effective panicles, thereby reducing excessive vegetative growth of rice (Carrijo et al., 2017; Z. Li et al., 2018; Liao et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2009). This may also be an important reason for the decrease in the uptake of soil N by rice under AWD irrigation. Urea application was a key factor in improving rice yield (J. Wang et al., 2017), but it also aggravated soil N uptake by rice, and soil was the largest source of N for rice in all treatments (Fig. 4). Compared with U, under CF irrigation and mild AWD irrigation, US reduced the uptake of soil-derived N by rice, and the trend was more obvious under mild AWD irrigation. Although the trend was not significant, rice straw return may be an effective way to maintain long-term soil fertility (Fig. 4).In our study, mild AWD irrigation, urea application and rice straw return all increased yield-scaled N2O emissions (Table 1), mainly due to improved soil aeration and increased inorganic N and rice straw decomposition, resulting in more N2O production (Andren et al., 1993; Buchen et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2016; Lagomarsino et al., 2016; Fiedler et al., 2017; Verhoeven et al., 2018; Congreves et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2021). Although mild AWD irrigation had higher yield-scaled N2O emissions than CF irrigation, the GWP (CH4+N2O) under mild AWD irrigation was significantly lower than that under CF irrigation and decreased by 8.1%, 57.9%, 11.8% and 62.9% under CK, S, U and US, respectively (Table S1 in the Supplement). Therefore, mild AWD irrigation combined with rice straw return may be a promising agronomic measure that maintains rice yield, slows greenhouse effects (CO2 emissions are not considered), and also reduces soil fertility consumption.5ConclusionsThe effects of irrigation methods, N levels and rice straw return on N2O emissions were explored through pot experiments using rice. We found that N2O emissions were affected by urea application and irrigation methods, with urea application being the most important. Compared with CF irrigation, mild AWD irrigation increased cumulative N2O emissions, with an average increase of 28.8%. In addition, adding rice straw to mild AWD irrigation further stimulated N2O emissions by 18.1%. Under the condition of urea application, compared with CF irrigation, mild AWD irrigation increased the yield-scaled N2O emissions by 17.9%, and the addition of rice straw further promoted the yield-scaled N2O emissions under mild AWD irrigation by 17.4% but reduced the GWP (CH4+N2O) by 62.9%. Under the condition of urea application, compared with CF irrigation, mild AWD irrigation reduced the uptake of soil-derived N and aboveground biomass of rice but did not reduce rice yield. Therefore, mild AWD irrigation combined with rice straw return may offer a promising agronomic measure to maintain high rice yield, reduce greenhouse effects, and maintain or improve soil fertility.Data availabilityThe data that support the findings of this study are available by request from the corresponding author (Lili Zhang).SupplementThe supplement related to this article is available online at: https://doi.org/10.5194/soil-8-645-2022-supplement.Author contributionsKW, WL, ZW and ZD conceived and designed the experiments; YM and NL performed the experiments; KW analyzed the data; KW and LZ wrote the paper and all authors approved submission of the paper.

The usage of sensors and networking unitsenable the optimal usage of irrigation resources, and is termed as precisionirrigation (PI). Thus, PI leverage an efficient solution to handle the scarcityof essential resources such as food, water, land units, and crop yields. Thus,farmers gets better returns in the market due to high production. However,in PI, the exchange of crop readings from sensor units to actuators are pro-cessed through open channels, that is, Internet. Thus, it open the doors formalicious intruders to deploy network and sensor-based attacks on PI-sensors,to drain the available resources, and battery power of sensor nodes in the net-work. This reduces the optimum and precise utilization of irrigation resources,low-yield crops and damaged crops in supply chain systems. This leads todissatisfaction among agriculture stakeholders such as quality control units,logistics, suppliers, and customers. Motivated from the above discussions, thesurvey presents the advantages of integrating blockchain (BC) with PI to handleissues pertaining to security, trust, and transactional payments among agricul-ture stakeholders. The survey is directed to achieve threefold objective- attackmodels and countermeasures in PI systems, integration of BC in PI to mitigateattack models, and research challenges in deploying BC in PI. To address thefirst objective, the survey proposes an in-depth comparative analysis of tradi-tional irrigation systems with PI, with discussions on attack models. To addressthe second objective, the survey proposes an integration model of BC with PIto secure IoT sensors, and maintain trust and transparency among stakehold-ers. Finally, the survey addresses the open research challenges of deploying BCin PI-based irrigation systems, and presents a case-study of AgriChain as anindustry ready-solution that envisions BC with PI ecosystem. Thus, the proposedsurvey acts as a roadmap for agriculture industry stakeholders, researchers, todeploy BC in IoT-based PI that leverages an efficient, robust, trust-worthy, andsecure ecosystem.Trans Emerging Tel Tech. 2020;e4059.wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/ett© 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.1 of 30https://doi.org/10.1002/ett.40592 of 30BODKHE et al.1INTRODUCTIONAgriculture industry plays a pivotal role in economic prosperity, sustainable growth, and maintaining globalgross-domestic product (GDP) of indicators of national growth.1 To sustain this national growth, the agriculture sectormeets the rising demands of food supply, resources, and land infrastructure, to match the supply curve of increasingpopulation. As per the report of the World Bank on agriculture and rural development,2 65% population of the worlddepends on agriculture sector, and productivity of global agricultural sector is predicted to increase by 1.75% annually tomeet requirements of approximately 10 billion people by 2050.3 The rise in world population is analyzed in Figure 1A.According to the report of the world bank, as shown in Figure 1B, the food demand is expected to rise by 35% globally, soefficient measures are required to increase quality of crop yields to ensure good returns and profits, as well as meet theglobal demand of food. According to the report by the global productivity index, the growth rate in agriculture produc-tivity is currently at 0.96%, which is expected to increase to 1.75% by 2050. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) isexpected to rise to 1.87 million by 2023, as shown in Figure 2.To meet the growing demands of productivity and to manage the existing resources judiciously, new innovations arerequired in agriculture sector, mainly in irrigation systems. The traditional irrigation systems require manual labor, andcontinuous monitoring of crops, so that they are not wasted. To ensure healthy crop yield, the crops requires cultivationwith accurate measurements of soil moisture, temperature, and humidity levels. As traditional methods are manual, soirrigation systems are deeply flawed with inaccurate measurements of above mentioned parameters. This directly effectthe crop health, and thus, reduce the yield. Moreover, lack of precise dosage of pesticides in soil, and inaccurate rate ofwater flow through inlets such as pipes and tube-wells in plantation fields, lead to low yield. In addition, in many areas,(B)(A)F I G U R E 1Year-wise population and crop growth: A, Worldwide growth in population4 and B, crop yield growth5F I G U R E 2Integration of blockchain with PI.6 PI, precisionirrigationBODKHE et al.3 of 30F I G U R E 3Role of ICT in agriculture and PA.10 ICT, information and communication technology; PA, precision agriculturedue to geographical fluctuations, farmers suffer through water scarcity, leading to barren lands that are not cultivable. Asper the report by World Health Organization, around 4% of world’s freshwater resources are required to serve 17% of theworld population. Thus, the scarcity of water resources and lack of fresh water imprints forces the population to consumeimpure water. Dumping of industrial waste and home waste which are nonbiodegradable also leads to water pollution.Thus, the agridomain society needs to automate existing manual irrigation systems to reduce burden on farmers andmanage resources optimally. Currently, the world population is around 7.2 billion and it is expected to rise to more than9 billion by 2050.7 The automated irrigation employ usage of information and communication technology (ICT) tools tomanage irrigation resources optimally.As indicated in aforementioned discussions, ICT tools in agriculture sector leverages high crop yields and opti-mal utilization of resources. With a shift toward smart and sustainable cities, the modern agriculture systems haveemployed Internet of things (IoT)-based sensors to ensure precise utilization of agriculture resources. The preciseusage in agridomain through IoT-based sensors is coined as precision agriculture (PA).8 PA is a collective ecosystemthat combines diverse technologies such as IoT, communication systems such as remote sensing (RS), geographicalinformation system (GIS), global positioning system (GPS), and wireless sensor network (WSN) to collect crop data.The crop data aggregated at servers are analyzed through data-driven analytics, to form real-time informed decisions.Thus, PA has a metamorphic impact of agriculture industry, and thus, mostly all sectors (private, government, pub-lic) are adopting PA-based solutions to resolve agriculture challenges.9-11 In PA, to focus on irrigation-based techniques,precision irrigation (PI) incorporates the usage of IoT-based sensors in farm lands connected via networking infras-tructures that communicate in open channels, that is, Internet. Thus, PI allows precise measurements of resourcesto yield higher crop outputs and improves the overall quality of PA. Figure 3 depicts the role of ICT in agricultureand PI.PI allows the accurate usage of agricultural and livestock management inputs such as pesticides, fertilizer, and seeds,resulting in minimization costs and improved crop yields. However, the crop readings data is exchanged between sensorsunits, IoT gateways, and actuators through open wireless channels. Moreover, the shared data is stored in centralizedservers, which is more vulnerable to security attacks. Any malicious attackers can form an informed attack on servers,sensor units, and actuators to gain access to unauthorized crop data. This can lead to disastrous results, as readings canbe modified by an adversary that results in crop wastage. Thus, although the rapid advancement through ICT has helpedfarmers to automate irrigation tasks, but it has also introduced concerns of security and privacy attacks by maliciousintruders. In addition, due to incorrect measurements, the crops are damaged, and farmers are not able to sell them tothe markets. In addition, such attacks hamper the overall supply chain operations among agriculture stakeholders suchas farmers, logistics, warehouse owners, suppliers, and customers, that leads to dissatisfaction due to substandard cropgoods being exchanged. Therefore, there is a need of decentralized ecosystem in such IoT-based PI irrigation system toallow for optimal utilization of existing resources.Due to wastage of food resources, the report by World Bank states that the count of undernourished people exceededfrom 804 million in 2016 to 821 million in 2017.2 Thus, in smart PA ecosystems, food security is of paramount importance.To ensure high quality of crop yields, optimal usage of irrigation resources, food supply food tracebility, mitigate waterwastage, quality reinforcements are required by quality control teams that follow safety procedures right from plantinga seed to consumption of the finished food product.12,13 To ensure the desired quality of food supplies, a secure, decen-tralized, trust, and reliable ecosystem is required. Blockchain (BC) can leverage a trust based security solution in PA, andcan support secure data exchange among sensor units in IoT-based PI through distributed cryptographical primitivesof key exchange, encryption of exchanged data, and signature-based algorithms. In addition, it facilitates an auditable,chronological, timestamped, and automated transactional payment ecosystem among agriculture industry stakeholders-farmers, logistics, government, and vendors through execution of smart contracts among participating entities. As thesensor readings are recorded in distributed blocks, they are immutable to changes by an adversary. The recorded data4 of 30BODKHE et al.is added by miners in the chain through distribute consensus, and the newly added block is reflected to all stakehold-ers, ensuring fairness and transparency in the chain. The transactional history of all stakeholders can be viewed throughsmart BC-enabled mobile applications that records each block transactions. Thus, the proposed survey focuses on theopportunities and the research challenges of adopting BC as a potential solution to agriculture sector, mainly in smart PIsystems governed via IoT-based sensor units.1.1MotivationAs per the report of CAGR, the market for PI was around USD 2.76 billion in year 2017 and is expected to increase with7.2% by 2023.6 Most of the traditional IoT-based PI ecosystems are inadequate to handle security attacks, and handle trustamong distributed stakeholders. Motivated from the aforementioned discussions, in this survey, we present an exhaustiveanalysis on different security attacks vectors in IoT-based PI ecosystems through a detailed taxonomy and present coun-termeasures to mitigate the same. We also highlights the advantages of integrating BC as a possible solution to ensuresecurity and trust based framework that mitigates the attack vectors through a proposed framework. It allows PI plays tomanage the irrigation resources correctly and manage correct water-levels to maintain a healthy crop yield. In addition,as supply chain systems are automated via smart contracts, the overall profitability of agriculture sector improves, leadingto high return of investment to the prospective stakeholders in the industry.1.2Literature review of existing surveysTzounis et al14 discussed in-depth survey on microprecision models to support smart farming on IoT nodes and stud-ied about optimizing the resource utilization with dual effects of maximizing profits and minimizing loss of food supplychains in agriculture. The survey, however, did not discuss about various technical specifications related to data han-dling and interoperability among nodes in the network. The attacks related to security and control are not discussedas well.15 Kamilaris et al16 discusses the various deep-learning technical spread over 40 articles in agricultural domainfocused on models, the agricultural datasets, and how data-cleaning and preprocessing techniques are employed fortraining datasets.Once the performance metrics are decided, discussion on deep-learning models along with performance indicatorsare discussed. The article fails to draw attention on in-depth analysis and insights of obtained results to solve variousagricultural models in a generic domain. The discussion also lacks on sustainable and automated farming techniquesemployed by deep-learning models. Authors in Reference 17 discussed a survey on integrating IoT protocol stack tocomprehend the data analytics frameworks in agriculture sector. IoT increases the operational efficiency to increaseproductivity of irrigation and data analytics improves the overall logistic handling. The article presents the open chal-lenges in adoption of various protocols in IoT to make it affordable for long scale deployments. However, the surveydid not present the various security attacks possible in IoT infrastructures while data moves through the network dueto lack of open-standards in IoT stack. Zhao et al18 presented a systematic literature network over agrifood chain man-agement over 71 publications and built a citation network using gephi to study the effects of using BC to ensure servicelevel agreements in the supply chain. The article also proposed the critical challenges of adopting BC in such systemsand future research directions. The article lacked a comprehensive discussion of integration of BC and smart contractsexecution to ensure data interoperability, trust and tracebility in the agrichain. Jha et al19 highlighted the importanceof automated agriculture monitoring to minimize human interventions for selection of fertilizers to increase fertilityof crops. Neural network techniques to provide cost-effective solutions are provided for classification and grading ofcrops. The survey also discusses usage of IoT monitoring and its implications on traditional irrigation approaches. Thesurvey, however, fails to address selection of suitable approaches based on pesticides control, irrigation measurements,and pollution control. In addition, a discussion on automated water recycling and waste management is missing fromthe survey.Vasconez et al20 presented the recent state of research on human-robot interactions (HRI) applications to mitigatethe manual labor requirements in agricultural activities and increase productivity in handling crop management andsafety issues to minimize accidents. The demarcation of human and machine interactions are clearly presented in thesurvey. However, the survey fails to address the flexibility and adaptability issues in HRI interactions. Thus, real-lifemodels and application scenarios to build HRI systems are not discussed due to lack of cooperative standards. SarcBODKHE et al.5 of 30et al21 focused on designing effective solutions for recycling agricultural waste with use of robotic technologies. Thesurvey focused on four domains- waste collection, logistics, automated waste treatment, and data tools. Emphasis ofmixed waste is also highlighted in the survey. The survey lacks in discussing about IoT integration and physical mod-els to support waste management in irrigation systems. Authors in Reference 22 talks about PI systems employingIoT nodes to remotely monitor and manage agriculture activities. Discussion on the sensors and communication pro-tocols are presented for control and decision-making in PI. The survey lacks the discussion of security attacks in IoTbased PI infrastructure. Kamble et al23 highlighted recent trends and research over data-driven agrifood supply chaindepends on the comprehensive review of 84 articles and identified gaps in achieving sustainable standards for datacollection and deployment. The survey did not present the possible interactions of various components while dealingwith data.1.3Scope of this surveyThe surveys that are published till date by various researchers highlighted many aspects of smart agriculture systemsand PI, but mainly focused on the study of IoT protocols, communication standards, data analytics to improve logis-tics and decide key attributes of complex interrelated data, or on various application scenarios of irrigation systems. Fewsurveys are focused on usage of BC in agrichains to improve auditability, security, and asset-tracking between variousstakeholders in the supply chain. The proposed survey addresses the gap in earlier surveys as it provides a compre-hensive solution on the integration of BC in IoT-based PI ecosystems along-with research challenges in BC adoptionto the agriculture industry. To identify the pitfalls in earlier published surveys till-date, the authors have included areview method section that forms quality screening questions that investigate the advantages and merits of BC-adoptionin smart PI ecosystems. Based on the research questions, the survey presents a proposed BC-based PI framework thatcan address the issues of security attacks and trust among agriculture ecosystems. The proposed survey also focuses onthe possible security attacks and their countermeasures in the irrigation system with data analytics handled at differ-ent points in the network. In addition, to validate the merits of adopting BC, a case-study PI-Chain is presented thathandles how BC interacts with sensor units in an actual PI-ecosystem, while ensuring data analytics handling at vari-ous points in the network. Table 1 depicts a comparative summary of the existing literature surveys with the proposedsurvey article.1.4ContributionsFollowing are major research contributions of this article.• A detailed and comprehensive taxonomy of security attacks in PI-based irrigation systems based on attackers objectiveis presented.• Based on attack taxonomy, in depth investigation of attack countermeasures and security solutions with BC adoptionin IoT-based PI ecosystems is presented.

Due to limited sources of water, scarcity of water is a major concern. Watermanagement is widely recognized as a critical issue in the agricultural sector.27 Authors in Reference 28 discussed thatabout 70% of the existing fresh water is polluted in course of a decade, which is now being used for the agriculture sector.Panchard et al29 estimated that in developing countries, about 40% to 45% of the fresh-water which is used for agricultureis lost due to various reasons such as spills, evaporation, or absorption by the soil.30 So, water management is one of theprime concern in every crop systems. As water is getting more scarce, many farmers, and government associations arevery conscious about proper utilization of water. In the last four decades, various traditional microirrigation techniquessuch as drip irrigation, sprinkler, and so on were developed worldwide, but are not enough to resolve the aforementionedissues.29It is also observed that farmers suffer huge financial losses (which affects on GDP) due to inconvenient irrigationmethods and wrong prediction of weather and rain by the meteorological department.27,31 To prevent the misuse ofwater, smart irrigation systems are required that can help farmers to optimize water resource (Figure 6). Accurate andprecise irrigation techniques are necessary so that amount of water can be optimally utilized and wastage of water ismitigated.33,34PI is a precision activity which involves the accurate assessment of the crop water requirements and the precise appli-cation of this volume at the required time.35 It has a capability to increase the water use and economic efficiency’s bymatching irrigation inputs to yields in each area of a field. It also reduces cost of inputs results and increases the yield forthe same inputs. Crop yields are improved through proper gathering and maintaining of information of the crop and field.It has benefits such as reduction in water use, improvement in the crop yields, minimizing cost of inputs, and reductionin risk. Authors in References 36-39 applied ICT-based techniques such as RS, GIS, GPS, and WSN in irrigation systems toenhance irrigation system and agricultural water management system efficiency’s.

Introduction\\nWater resources are one of the most important resources on Earth but are uneven in both time and space distribution. Agriculture, as the foundation of human society, is by far the biggest consumer of water. Therefore, the use of water resources with high efficiency is an important research field in agricultural development. Multiple technologies have been developed to improve water utilization, such as soil-less culture [1], sprinkling irrigation [2], [3], and trickle irrigations [4]. Although recent advances in agriculture have dramatically improved water use efficiency, there is still a high demand for saving water to further improve water utilization in some dry areas.\\n\\nIrrigation systems have been effectively used in agriculture for many years. A conventional irrigation system requires many wires to collect sensor signals and transmit commands to control the solenoid valves. The high cost of cables and various accessories makes the entire system expensive and complex, limiting the scale of deployment. Emerging communication technologies, such as general packet radio service (GPRS) cellular networks [5], [6], ZigBee [6], [7], and Bluetooth [8], enable wireless coverage for farmland. However, they also have some limitations. For instance, the devices using GPRS always consume power, which increases the maintenance workload of battery replacement. In addition, they rely on the cellular network provided by telecom operators, which is not reliable in some rural areas. As to the solutions with ZigBee or Bluetooth, the communication distance is not long enough to cover the large area of farmland, although the low power performance of the devices can be guaranteed. Recently, multiple low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies have emerged, such as NB-IoT, SigFox, and long range (LoRa) radio technique. The key features of LPWAN technology include a long-distance communication, low power consumption, high capacity, and low cost. The LPWAN overcomes the limitations of conventional wireless technologies. Combined with energy harvesting, it makes energy-autonomous IoT nodes possible. Consequently, it is a promising technology to be used in wireless irrigation systems.\\n\\nIn recent years, several IoT-enabled water management solutions have been developed for precision agriculture. However, most of them are sensing-based solutions, and the watering schedule is a predefined offline system. Few solutions consider the user’s experience, knowledge, and long-term environmental variables. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI), the long short-term memory network (LSTM), was introduced in the field of precision agriculture [9]. As a special type of neural network, the LSTM is especially helpful for the time series analysis [10]. It inspires us to use LSTM to analyze the relationship between weather changes and irrigation needs set by farmers and gardeners. Further, the acquired models can predict the future irrigation needs for common users. In order to achieve the goal, an intelligent water irrigation system is proposed. The novelty of the work is that an intelligent irrigation system with data fusion is proposed. The data fusion model considers the history of local weather, irrigation logs, weather forecasts, and real-time sensor data; analyzes their internal relationships; and then forms a big data fusion system to improve water-saving efficiency.\\n\\nThis article presents an intelligent irrigation system based on a LoRa network and a data fusion model. The following are the technical contributions of this work.\\n\\n•\\nWe explore the method of data fusion to realize intelligent irrigation. Unlike the conventional predefined offline system, the proposed system combines history logs, weather forecasts, and real-time data to predict the proper water demand for future irrigation. By loading knowledge from different domains, the data fusion model is expected to extend to more IoT application scenarios.\\n\\n•\\nWe implement a self-powered wide-area network using LoRa to facilitate multiple IoT scenarios, owing to its long-range communication and low-power feature. The waterflow-based energy harvesting scheme is designed and implemented by integrating the micro hydro generator. The scheme can achieve maintenance-free of battery replacement in the whole life cycle.\\n\\n\\nThe rest of the article is organized as follows. The related work is introduced in Section 2. Section 3 describes the architecture and implementation of the proposed system. Section 4 provides the details of the experimental results. Finally, the conclusion is presented in Section 5.\\n\\n2. Related works\\n2.1. IoT-enabled intelligent irrigation\\nThe rapid development of the IoT has enabled irrigation systems with more new features that can effectively improve watering efficiency. In recent years, a variety of wireless sensor network (WSN)-based irrigation systems have been proposed. With sensors deployed, multiple types of environment information can be monitored. The irrigation system can determine watering actions based on the sensor data and the preset threshold by users [5], [7], [11], [12]. For example, Roy et al. [6] designed a real-time automated irrigation system for crop fields. The system sets up the WSN to sense the parameters of the environment using ZigBee. More recently, LoRa was introduced for various IoT applications [13], [14]. Zhao et al. [15] designed and implemented a smart irrigation system based on LoRa. The system can cover up to 8 km, while the node is self-powered with a water turbocharge mechanism.\\n\\nAnother widely used water-saving technique is evapotranspiration (ET)-based irrigation. The concept of ET is to calculate the evaporation from the soil surface and the transpiration through plant canopies [16]. The ET-based intelligent watering controller calculates the watering demand based on the value of ET [17], [18]. Klein et al. [19] demonstrated a closed loop irrigation system that calculates the water requirement from satellite images and local daily weather. It achieved a 26% yield increase and a 16% increase in water-use efficiency. Munoz et al. [20] proposed a cloud platform for greenhouse crop production. It provides forecasting based on models for the climate, crop production, and irrigation processes, which makes it more flexible than traditional hard-coded approaches. The ET-certified controller usually costs a few hundred dollars on the market. In addition, the parameter setting is complicated, requiring professional weather and agronomy knowledge.\\n\\nIn recent years, AI has emerged as a new technology introduced in agriculture [21]. Specifically, in the field of water conservation, multiple machine learning algorithms have been proposed to simulate the water-balancing model and predict the water demand [22], [23], [24], [25]. Goap et al. [22] proposed a machine learning algorithm to estimate the difference and changes in soil moisture due to weather conditions. Chang et al. [23] proposed a machine-learning-based smart irrigation system with a LoRa P2P network that can automatically learn the irrigation experiences from expert farmers for greenhouse crops. Moghadas et al. [24] proposed an algorithm for accurate characterization of the soil moisture from electromagnetic induction data using Bayesian inference and a neural network. Nie et al. [25] presented the prediction result of soil moisture by employing different machine learning models.\\n\\n2.2. Data fusion\\nWith the development of the IoT and big data, the explosive growth of various types of data has brought great challenges to data processing and utilization. Data fusion, which can be explained as the process of fusing multiple records representing the same real-world object into a single, consistent, and clean representation, is used to integrate huge amounts of data from heterogeneous information systems [26].\\n\\nData fusion was first applied in the military [27]. It is extremely important to obtain all kinds of useful sensor information on the battlefield, for example, by evaluating battlefield situation and threats and providing tactical and strategic decision-making assistance for the combat forces. With the continuous development of data fusion, it gradually expanded to many other areas, such as cyber–physical–social systems [28], human activity detection and health monitoring [29], sentiment analysis of educational big data [30], and industrial fault detection and identification [31]. Multiple methodologies for cross-domain data fusion have been proposed [32]. Dragos et al. [33] presented a method to combine soft and sensor data to create enhanced situation assessment for a track-and-detect application. Chen et al. [34] proposed a ternary data fusion model based on reinforcement learning in the production process of hot rolling. By merging the ternary data, faster and better decisions can be made. Zhao et al. [35] developed a positioning system using big sensor data preprocessing in multi-source fusion. The fusion technique can reduce the data collection amount significantly.\\n\\nData fusion has also been further extended to the field of precision agriculture. In 2014, Mouazen et al. [36] presented a data fusion approach for the delineation of water-holding capacity zones for site-specific irrigation based on multiple sensors. More recently, Viani et al. [37] proposed a low-cost wireless monitoring and decision support system for water conservation in agriculture. The system contains a fuzzy logic theory that integrates the farmers’ experience, irrigation practices, soil conditions, and crop models, providing improved water conservation compared to the conventional threshold-based technique.\\n\\nIn summary, the existing automatic irrigation systems are mostly sensing-based solutions. The watering demand algorithms are usually threshold-trigged, timer-based, soil–water balancing schemes, and ET-based, which lack the ability to dynamically adjust in time according to weather changes. To the best of our knowledge, few studies have focused on AI-based systems with data fusion. In this article, we propose a knowledge-based data fusion model based on big data, that is, the history of local weather, irrigation logs, weather forecasts, and real-time sensor data. The model can achieve optimization for the future watering schedule to improve water-saving efficiency. In addition, as we load the knowledge from different domains into the proposed model, the system can be extended to more IoT application scenarios.\\n\\n\\nDownload : Download high-res image (563KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 1. Architecture of the intelligent irrigation system.\\n\\n3. System architecture and implementation\\nThe architecture of the system is shown in Fig. 1. It consists of three phases, devices, cloud, and user. Various LoRa nodes are deployed in multiple scenarios, such as landscape watering, dust removal, and agriculture irrigation. The LoRa gateways are deployed as a data hub, in which the data from LoRa nodes are preliminarily processed and transmitted to the cloud platform. The IoT cloud platform hosts the LoRa network and provides services for each function block. The data fusion model deployed in the cloud platform optimizes the watering scheduler. Different domains of knowledge can be selected and input to the data fusion model to fit the corresponding application scenarios. Moreover, users can access the irrigation system either from a mobile application or a web interface to check and control the watering schedule remotely.\\n\\n3.1. Hardware design\\n3.1.1. Gateway\\nThe LoRa gateway is the core of the LoRa network and acts as a relay between the LoRa nodes and the cloud platform. For irrigation in farmland, the gateway is usually deployed on the top of a tower or a building. It can provide signal coverage over the whole farmland, usually dozens of square kilometers. As for landscape watering in a garden, the gateway can be mounted on the wall of a house, depending on the ease of installation and electrical connection. Further, the whole LoRa gateway is packaged in a plastic box with IP-68 standards to provide waterproof capability.\\n\\n\\nDownload : Download high-res image (432KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 2. Design of the LoRa gateway and nodes. (a) LoRa gateway. (b) Valve node. (c) Sensing node. (d) Micro hydro generator integration.\\n\\nThe gateway consists of a microprocessor and multiple modules to realize communication, execution, display, and other functions. An ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller is selected as the core of the gateway. It can provide high performance calculation with low power consumption. It has rich communication interfaces such as USART, I2C, and SPI, which are sufficient to interact with other modules. A 2-Kb electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM) is used as external memory to backup data and configurations in case of power loss. The gateway provides both wired and wireless connections to the valve nodes. For the wired access, the interface of the 12-zone 24-V AC output is designed through optoisolators. The AC output can connect directly to the valve nodes, controlling their working states. A programmable logic controller (PLC) interface is also integrated into the board, providing an alternative method of node connection. For wireless access, a LoRa module is customized based on sx1268 from Semtech. The communication distance can be as far as 8 km. The module supports a LoRa network with up to 72 nodes. To interact with the cloud platform, the gateway supports multiple communication modules for facilitating different scenarios, including Wi-Fi (USR-WIFI232), LTE cat −1 (WH-GM5), and Ethernet. Also, a 480 × 320 LCD touch screen is used to set local configurations and display the basic information of the gateway. The printed circuit board (PCB) of the LoRa gateway is depicted in Fig. 2(a).\\n\\n3.1.2. LoRa node\\nThe LoRa nodes, both the valve node (Fig. 2(b)) and sensing node (Fig. 2(c)) are deployed in the farmland far away from the gateway, controlling the solenoid valves or collecting environment information. An ARM Cortex M0 microcontroller operating at 32 MHz is selected. It has 8 Kb of RAM and 64 Kb of Flash, which are sufficient for the program running on the LoRa node. Compared with the gateway, the peripheral modules are simplified. A LoRa module is integrated for communication with the gateway. The power-management module performs the power conversion from the battery. The LCD is designed for local debugging and configuration and is tiny and power efficient. It can be disabled after deployment. There is a slight difference between the two types of nodes. The valve node supports a two-zone output to switch the valve on and off. The output signal is a 9-V 120 ms pulse, so a power conversion circuit with large capacity is carefully designed to store enough power to drive the valve. As to the sensing node, an RS485 interface is implemented instead of the DC output. The RS485 module provides an interface for multiple sensors.\\n\\nUnlike the gateway, the nodes are usually in a power-constrained environment with limited access to electricity. For both the valve node and sensing node, a 2200-mAh Li-ion battery is selected to provide the power supply. In addition, a micro hydro generator is integrated with the valve node, as shown in Fig. 2(d). The water pipe is divided into two branches: One is for the irrigation and another is for electricity generation. This structure successfully avoids the decrease of water flow velocity caused by the generator. The charging current is between 200 mA and 300 mA at a fixed 5-V output, which is much higher than that consumed by the node every day. Therefore, the valve node can be self-powered, forming an energy-autonomous system.\\n\\nThe PCB of the node and the battery is packaged inside an IP-68 waterproof plastic box, with dimension of 90 mm  × 50 mm × 42 mm. The antenna, made from flexible material is attached to the inner side of the box, which makes the node compact.\\n\\n3.2. Software design\\n3.2.1. Cloud platform\\nA cloud platform is designed and implemented. Considering the high availability and load balancing, an HTTP-MQ architecture is designed and deployed. The core of the cloud platform is the clustered servers, in which RabbitMQ is installed as the middleware of the message queue. The servers provide both the RabbitMQ application program interface (API) and hypertext transport protocol (HTTP) API for different types of connections. The LoRa gateways and mobile applications connect to the servers through the HAProxy server via the message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol. Moreover, the web client connects the servers through the Nginx server, where HTTP requests are distributed. Benefiting from such an architecture, the mobile application can connect to the devices through the shared memory message queue. Therefore, the latency is significantly reduced compared with the HTTP request mechanism. To meet the requirement of storing heterogeneous data, a MySQL database and a backup database are implemented.\\n\\n3.2.2. Mobile application\\nA mobile application is developed to provide an application software and an interface for the users, as shown in Fig. 3. The menu interface (Fig. 3(a)) contains manual watering, irrigation schedule, real-time sensor display, system settings, smart watering, and history records. The watering time of each valve can be set in the manual watering interface (Fig. 3(b)). A timer-based scheduler (Fig. 3(c)) is available for the user to set the watering time and frequency for a whole week. The offset of sensitivity can be set according to the user’s experience. The real-time sensor data, such as soil temperature and moisture, air temperature and humidity, and water flow, provide online monitoring for users, as shown in Fig. 3(d). The data are also uploaded to the cloud platform as feedback for the intelligent irrigation model. The history records depict the daily and monthly water consumption for the user, as illustrated in Fig. 3(e). Fig. 3(f) shows the smart watering interface. Once it is enabled, the data fusion model is activated. It provides the watering adjustment by combining multi-source data. As a result, the watering schedule is optimized automatically.\\n\\n\\nDownload : Download high-res image (419KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 3. Mobile application interface. (a) Menu. (b) Manual watering. (c) Irrigation schedule. (d) Real-time sensor display. (e) History records. (f) Local weather information.\\n\\n3.3. Data fusion model\\nFor conventional irrigation systems, the valve controllers are deployed in each zone of the garden or farmland. The controllers are usually timer-based. The users usually roughly set the daily watering schedule in advance according to their experiences. However, such a setting is inconvenient in daily life and inflexible for dynamic adjustment. Various factors affect the watering schedule. For example, the watering amount can be reduced if there is a thundershower just before watering. Therefore, an intelligent irrigation with watering schedule optimization is needed.\\n\\nTo solve the problem, a data fusion model based on the LSTM network is implemented and deployed on the cloud platform, as shown in Fig. 4. The historical weather data and the irrigation logs are sourced from the last two years. The weather forecast for the next few days is also ported to the model through the API from the website. The real-time environment information is collected from the sensing nodes for feedback. Thus, the data from the past, present, and future are used together as the input parameters to the model. Through the fusion of multi-source data, the model learns the users’ irrigation experiences in the past few years, and then outputs the optimized irrigation schedule.\\n\\n\\nDownload : Download high-res image (198KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 4. Data fusion framework.\\n\\nThe historical weather data and user irrigation logs are exported from the database online. It covers as much climate information as possible in the past 2 years to ensure the generalization ability of the model. The 13 types of weather information in an hourly interval are used, including temperature, daytime, wind speed, wind direction, weather code, precipitation, humidity, visibility, pressure, cloud cover, heat index, dew point, and wind gust speed. The irrigation logs of each zone are also combined as an input of the network. Therefore, the whole dataset is a matrix with 13+2 ×\\n columns. The first 13 columns represent the weather information, the following \\n columns represent the preset watering schedule of \\n zones, and the last \\n columns are the actual watering results which are set by professional gardeners. Each row shows the timestamps in hourly intervals. The data in each column are standardized to have zero mean and unit variance.\\n\\nAn LSTM network composed of six layers is implemented to estimate the proper watering schedule. The sequence input layer receives the data in hourly intervals. Then the LSTM layer with 200 hidden units learns the correlation of time series and the watering schedule. A dropout layer is used with a dropout probability of 0.5 to prevent overfitting. Also, two fully connected layers are added to achieve the conversion of different dimensions. Finally, the regression layer outputs the estimated results for the watering schedule. The action commands are sent to the valves through the watering scheduler. In this scenario, the online monitoring data are further used as feedback for the watering scheduler. Thus the closed loop of the irrigation system is built. It monitors the irrigation process conditions, such as the soil moisture content, to avoid any unexpected over-irrigation.\\n\\n4. System evaluation and analysis\\nThree scenarios of intelligent irrigation are deployed in this work. The first is a signal coverage test in an urban area. The second is the irrigation of apple seeding in a greenhouse located in Shaan Xi Province, China. In this scenario, the mist spray in the greenhouses is frequently switched on/off every few tens of seconds to maintain the optimal air humidity for apple seeding. Thus, the system’s real-time performance is assessed. The final scenario is landscape watering in a private home garden where we pay more attention to intelligent irrigation as well as low power consumption.\\n\\n\\nDownload : Download high-res image (1MB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 5. Signal coverage test. (a) Baud rate: 50.78 bps. (b) Baud rate: 2.4k bps.\\n\\n4.1. Case I: Urban signal coverage\\nThe signal coverage test is conducted in an urban area. The LoRa gateway is placed on top of a building. The detailed parameters are listed in Table 1. During the test, the LoRa node is placed on a moving car and slowly moved far away from the gateway. The position and received signal strength indication (RSSI) are recorded and displayed on the map, as illustrated in Fig. 5. Two types of tests with different transmission speeds are carried out. For the baud rate of 50.78 bps, the communication distance is as far as 8 km, and the receiving sensitivity can be lower than −120 dBm. For the baud rate of 2.4 kbps, the communication distance is a bit lower, around 5.6 km. The results show that the signal coverage decreases with the increase of the transmission rate, which is a tradeoff during deployment.\\n\\n\\nDownload : Download high-res image (335KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 6. System deployment. (a) Gateway. (b) Node.\\n\\n4.2. Case II: Greenhouse mist spray\\n4.2.1. System latency\\nThe LoRa network is deployed on farmland composed of several greenhouses. The gateway is installed in a metal box (Fig. 6(a)). The LoRa nodes are placed in the greenhouses, connected to the valves and sensors (Fig. 6(b)). The distance between the gateway and each node is less than 1.5 km. Also, there is no obvious obstruction for the radio transmission, so, the signal coverage can be well guaranteed.\\n\\n\\nDownload : Download high-res image (242KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 7.

An experiment on the transmission latency between the LoRa gateway and the LoRa nodes is conducted. The gateway broadcasts the packet with 10 bytes periodically. The system latency is recorded as soon as the packet is received by the node. As illustrated in Fig. 7, with the increase of the transmission speed, the receiving latency is significantly reduced. The curve flattens out when the transmission speed exceeds 10 kbps. To ensure a latency meets real-time demands, a transmission speed of at least 2.4 kbps is required, and then, the latency can be less than 300 ms.\\n\\n4.3. Case III: Landscape watering\\nWe also deploy a LoRa network at a private garden, in Mission Viejo, California, USA. The garden is divided into four zones. A valve node is deployed in each zone to control the watering. Unlike the greenhouse, the low-power and smart watering performance is of greater concern in this scenario.\\n\\n\\nDownload : Download high-res image (267KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 8.

Low power performance\\nThe battery-powered nodes are deployed in the garden. The wireless solution can reduce the cost of deployment compared with the wired controllers, in which the power cable accounts for a large proportion. A detailed analysis of energy consumption is carried out. The analysis is assumed in a daily use scenario. The irrigation system works once a day, and the valve is switched on for 1 min. The LoRa module consumes a considerable amount of current; so an experiment is conducted to observe the power consumption under different conditions. The module is configured in sleep state. It wakes up at regular intervals to listen for any packets to receive. The experiment result is shown in Fig. 8. It is obvious that with the increase of the wake-up interval, the average current decreases significantly, especially when the wake-up time is less than 2500 ms. Besides, a lower speed transmission rate consumes more current, as it takes more time for the RF module to transmit the same length of data. Considering the balance between power consumption and response time, as well as the signal coverage, a wake-up period of 2 s is selected with a transmission speed of 2.4 kbps.\\n\\nThe total power consumption of the LoRa node consists of five parts in different working states. For each state the current is carefully measured, as shown in Table 2. Then, the amount of battery power consumed is determined using the following equations:\\n(1)\\n(2)\\n(3)\\n(4)\\n(5)\\nwhere:\\n\\n is the power consumption of the main board in sleeping mode;\\n\\n is the power consumption of the LoRa module in standby mode;\\n\\n is the power consumption of the main board in working mode;\\n\\n is the power consumption of the LoRa module in data transmitting mode; and\\n\\n is the power consumed to switch the valve on and off. hence, the energy consumed everyday can be calculated as follows:\\n(6)\\nThe number of days can be obtained as follows:\\n(7)\\nIn this sense, a battery-powered valve node can work for approximately 18 months at a frequency of switching valve eight times every day. In some real deployment environments, the frequency of valve action is lower than the calculated assumption, so, the battery life cycle can be further extended.\\n\\nIn addition, the microhydro generator is integrated in some application scenarios. In this case, the battery is charged when the valve is on. According to the previous assumption, the valve is switched on four times for 1 min each time. The generated electricity is determined by using the following equation:\\n(8)\\nIt is obvious that \\n can cover the energy consumption, \\n. This indicates that an average of 1 min of charging can fulfill the node’s daily energy consumption. In fact, the irrigation time can be larger in some actual deployments. Therefore, the node can be self-powered, achieving an energy-autonomous system.\\n\\n4.3.2. Intelligent watering performance\\nThere is a dry season and a rainy season in Mission Viejo, California, as shown in Fig. 9. From June to October, there is almost no rain (less than 5 mm). The rainy season is from November to April, in which the rainfall is always larger than 60 mm. Therefore, there is a strong correlation between the local weather and watering amount. For the sake of sightseeing, it is necessary to ensure the normal growth of flowers and grass. Owing to the lack of water, the use of a smart controller is incentivized by law to avoid over-irrigation in California, especially as rainfall is abundant some days.\\n\\n\\nDownload : Download high-res image (357KB)\\nDownload : Download full-size image\\nFig. 9.

The study aims to predict soil moisture and, as such, the need for irrigation, using nonlinear mathematical models, describing the relationship between RGB and HSL colour model components and soil moisture and temperature. Nonlinear mathematical models used in the study are based on piecewise linear regression with breakpoint and soil moisture prediction using colour components and soil temperature with a deviation of +-6%. A system for automated irrigation was created and its control program was made, the basic control law of which is based on non-linear piecewise linear models. The automated irrigation management system includes a remote crop monitoring subsystem and an irrigation management subsystem. The program processes the photo received from the camera and activates the actuators when watering is needed. Compared to manual data collection in the first part of the study, the program calculates the average RGB model values from images in the studied row of tomato plantations with an accuracy of over 99% for the R and G components and over 92% for the B component. The program also predicts soil moisture with 98% accuracy. The practical significance of the water-saving efforts of this study lies in the development of a program-controlled automated irrigation system that utilizes plants as biological sensors, employing nonlinear mathematical models based on leaf colour changes to accurately predict soil moistureKeywords:biosensors; precision irrigation; RGB colourimetry; image processing; digitalization; bioinformaticshttps://doi.org/10.48077/scihor1.2024.127Retrieved from Vol. 27, No. 1, 2024Pages 127-139Share148 Views READ ARTICLEREFERENCESSUGGESTED CITATIONReferences[1] Araújo-Paredes, C., Portela, F., Mendes, S., & Valín, M.I.

However, large-scale VGS are costly and require ongoing maintenance, typically carried out manually through trial and error based on professional experience. Advanced management is essential for the sustainability of VGS due to its limited accessibility and associated costs. To address these challenges, we examined the use of remote sensing methods for outdoor VGS monitoring as a basis for a precision agriculture approach for VGS management and maintenance. This study presents the first ongoing monitoring of real-scale VGS using thermal, hyperspectral, and RGB vegetation indices. These indices were employed for the early detection of vegetation stress, focusing on two case studies exhibiting visible yellowing symptoms. Through the application of unsupervised classification techniques, stressed pixels were successfully detected 14–35 days before visual yellowing, achieving an accuracy of 0.85–0.91. Additionally, the thermal index provided valuable information regarding the spatial distribution of watering along the VGS. Stress maps based on noninvasive methods were demonstrated, forming the basis of a spatial decision support system capable of detecting issues related to plant vitality and VGS irrigation management.Keywords: vertical greenery systems (VGS); green wall; monitoring VGS; VGS maintenance; nature-based solution; VGS health1. IntroductionVertical greenery systems (VGS) have gained popularity in recent decades as a nature-based solution and adaptation method for the adverse effects of urbanization and climate change [1]. In addition to their aesthetic benefits, VGS contribute to both indoor and outdoor environments by improving air quality [2,3,4], creating a milder microclimate [5,6], reducing energy consumption [6,7,8], and noise pollution [9,10]. Furthermore, VGS may enhance the psychological well-being of building residents or users [11,12].However, covering buildings with VGS presents significant challenges. The installation, operation, and maintenance of VGS can be complex and costly [13]. Issues such as irrigation problems or plant damage may necessitate specialists’ expertise and the use of cranes, further escalating expenses [14]. Moreover, poorly maintained VGS can lead to dissatisfaction among residents and passersby and can increase fire risk [15], undermining the potential benefits of using VGS as an adaptive solution. Therefore, the continuous monitoring of VGS is crucial, especially since the plants are often difficult to access, and conditions may vary significantly along the VGS [16]. In situ sensors provide valuable continuous monitoring of VGS, but the spatial distribution of the vegetation status cannot be easily achieved [17].The growing demand for efficient VGS monitoring methods to facilitate proper maintenance has arisen as VGS becomes more prevalent in urban areas, along with other green and blue infrastructures [18]. Currently, irrigation in commercial VGS is often determined through trial and error, and VGS health monitoring is primarily based on expert observations conducted periodically [19]. To address the complexities of large-scale VGS maintenance, information technologies (IT), the Internet of Things (IoT), and advanced monitoring technologies may offer valuable assistance [20].Adopting remote sensing and precision agriculture methods for VGS can greatly improve ongoing plant monitoring and aid in the early detection of plant stress. Early detection of changes in plant health is critical for successful agricultural growth [21]. Hyperspectral (HS) and thermal (TIR) imaging are well-established methods in agriculture and natural areas [22,23,24]. The interaction of objects with light at different wavelengths determines their spectral characteristics. For instance, plant pigments exhibit distinct features, such as chlorophyll absorption bands in the blue and red regions. Healthy plants generally have lower reflectance in the visible bands and higher reflectance in the near-infrared (NIR) bands than plants under stress. HS imaging can identify subtle differences in vegetation that may not be visible to the human eye. This technique has been successfully applied to various crops, including estimating biochemical and biophysical properties; evaluating nutrient and stress status; classifying or detecting crop types, weeds, and diseases; and investigating soil characteristics [25,26]. Nevertheless, HS cameras are expensive, and analyzing tens to hundreds of bands in the visible and near-infrared regions can be computationally intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, vegetation indices (VIs) are commonly used to quantitatively and qualitatively highlight specific vegetation features, such as chlorophyll and water content, based on a combination of reflectance at two or more wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum [27]. TIR imaging is often employed to assess temperature differences indicating stress derived from diseases [28] or water deficits in crops [29]. Furthermore, TIR imaging allows targeted interventions and optimization of irrigation strategies [30,31,32].The increasing focus on vertical farming has spurred the advancement of IoT smart sensing technology. This includes a range of sensors implemented to track variables such as room temperature, light intensity, humidity levels, and soil nutrition [33]. Additionally, cable-driven robot prototypes have been developed to monitor and care for vegetation in hard-to-reach areas [14,34]. Some studies have also demonstrated the application of image processing techniques to identify fruits [34], employ Machine Learning Algorithms for detecting tomato diseases [35], and support decisions on whether the plant can be harvested or not using a simple NDVI threshold [36]. Nonetheless, progress in monitoring outdoor VGS remains limited.Gunawardena and Steemers [20], conducted a study on the main maintenance challenges in outdoor VGS based on 12 European case studies. They found that real-time stress detection, and automated response mechanisms were not operational in any of the installations inspected, despite the evident need for such capabilities. While several studies have estimated the water requirement for VGS irrigation management [19,37,38], the utilization of remote sensing in VGS studies is limited. Pérez-Urrestarazu et al. [37] found that using a thermal camera could be valuable in determining substrate moisture to optimize VGS irrigation. Nevertheless, in VGS studies, thermal imaging was primarily performed to assess the wall and foliage skin temperatures [39,40], which could affect the outdoor and indoor microclimate [6].While some studies have explored the use of hyperspectral imaging in green roofs [41,42], its application in VGS is still at a preliminary stage. Yuan et al. [43] monitored the water stress of an indoor green wall using the “triangle method”, which includes surface temperature and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Helman et al. [17] used HS and TIR cameras for spatially continuous monitoring as part of an integrated system that examines the benefits of an indoor green wall. They utilized HS imaging to separate plant species through supervised classification and established correlations between the HS VIs and plants’ CO2 assimilation rate. They also demonstrated a negative correlation between TIR images and stomatal conductance. To the best of our knowledge, except for a few studies that monitored VGS skin temperature, remote sensing tools in VGS studies have been applied only to indoor environments, which are much more homogenous in terms of illumination and climate.Continual monitoring of VGS holds paramount importance for maintenance, encompassing vegetation health and the fine-tuning of irrigation and fertilization systems [20]. Automated monitoring can enhance performance and facilitate decisions in managing VGS. Detecting issues early in vegetated walls can avert irreversible situations necessitating extensive plant replacement. The primary objective of this study is to deploy ground-based remote sensing methods for the assessment of outdoor VGS health. While hyperspectral and thermal cameras offer advanced capabilities, our focus is on demonstrating the practical potential of these methods for monitoring VGS. This approach involves the establishment of a time series comprising RGB, HS, and TIR indices. Furthermore, we used unsupervised classification to detect stressed vegetation in early stages as a basis for a spatial decision support system for real-scale VGS. This study highlights the potential use of remote sensing in enhancing VGS monitoring.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Study AreaThe study was conducted on real-scale VGS as part of the BIU-VGS project at Bar Ilan University (32.067, 34.842) in Mediterranean climate Ramat Gan, the central region of Israel (Figure 1). The study site comprised three identical buildings in the southern campus, which replicated two east–west oriented street canyons. Each building consisted of five floors, with an overall height of 20 m. The canyons had concrete walls facing north and south. During the period from 3 to 18 November 2019, planters were installed on two parallel vertical walls in one of the canyons, covering approximately 450 m2 of vegetated area for each wall. Two VGS technologies were utilized—a green/living wall (GW) on the eastern shafts and a vertical forest (planter boxes attached to the wall) on the remaining walls and the western shafts. The GW was constructed using plastic modules containing a blended soil substrate for planting (40% peat, 40% coconut, and 20% perlite). The case study focused on the GWs located on two vertical concrete walls—one facing north (building 212) and the other facing south (building 213), as shown in Figure 1b. Each GW had dimensions of 11 m in height and 2.7 m in width, covered with plant species Viola hederacea (Figure 1c) and Hedera helix (Figure 1d).Figure 1. The study site. (a) Location (yellow star) of the BIU-VGS project in the eastern Mediterranean. (b) Close-up of the study site. The location of the north and south-facing GWs, as well as air temperature (Ta) and relative humidity (RH) sensors (in red circles) are indicated. (c) GW species Viola hederacea. (d) GW species Hedera helix. (e) Weekly water accumulation of the six irrigation pipes at the north-facing (212) and south-facing GWs (213) and weekly mean air temperature (Ta) at the center of the canyon (dotted red line).The irrigation and fertilization of the GW were provided through an automated system based on scheduled programs planned by an irrigation expert. Each GW contained six irrigation lines, with drippers placed every 15 cm along the width of each line. Irrigation was applied at midnight either every one day (during summer) or every two days (during winter). Figure 1e presents the weekly average water accumulation during the study period. The quantities were adjusted based on seasonal variations and, in rare instances, an expert made decisions to decrease or increase water amounts based on direct observations made on-site. The average weekly quantities during May–October were 1.18 m3 (north-facing GW) and 1.56 m3 (south-facing GW), while irrigation significantly decreased during November–December to weekly average quantities of 0.16 m3 (north-facing) and 0.23 m3 (south-facing).2.2. Data AcquisitionThis study was conducted over 8 months between May and December 2020. GWs were monitored every 1–3 weeks using HS and TIR cameras. The cameras were mounted on a 1.5 m height tripod and manually operated from a fixed point on the ground, approximately 15 m away from the GW (Figure 2a,b). All images were collected during midday (11:00 A.M.–2:00 P.M. LT) under clear sky conditions.Figure 2. Data acquisition at the study site. (a) Locations (rectangles) of the HS and TIR shooting of the north (blue) and south (orange) facing GWs. (b) The thermal camera on a tripod toward the north-facing GW at the study site. (c) The timing of the data acquisition in this study, including the yellowing events that were studied for early detection of stress (see Section 2.4) and COVID quarantines that affected mainly the collection of TIR data.The HS images were obtained using a Specim IQ® camera (Specim–Spectral Imaging, Oulu, Finland) with a spectral resolution of 7 nm and 204 bands across the wavelength range of 397–1003 nm. Each image from the Specim IQ® camera was a square of 512 × 512 pixels with a field of view (FOV) of 31°, providing a spatial resolution of 3 cm/pixel at the GW. All images were normalized using a 99% barium sulfate white reference (provided with the camera). Due to the vertical alignment, large scale, and limited accessibility of the VGS, the camera operated in “custom” mode, where the white reference was recorded and saved to the camera before the actual VGS recordings. The white reference was placed at the lower area of each GW and recorded every 15 min.A FLIR A655sc (FLIR Systems, Wilsonville, OR, USA) camera was used for collecting TIR images. This camera is an uncooled microbolometer with 640 × 480 pixels, sensitive to radiation in the range of 7.5–14.0 µm. It is equipped with a lens with a FOV of 45° and provides a spatial resolution of 4 cm/pixel at the GW. The camera has a noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD, i.e., thermal sensitivity) of less than 30 mK and a thermal accuracy of ±2 °C or ±2% of the reading. The temperature values acquired by the camera were adjusted using FLIR Research IR software (version 4.40.9.30) by setting the air temperature (Ta), relative humidity (RH), and target distance. An emissivity of 0.95 was used to correct all thermal images. Due to technical issues with the thermal camera during COVID-19 quarantine restrictions, intermittent gaps occurred in the TIR time series data. Ta and RH were measured at 30 min intervals using HMP 155 Vaisala sensors with an accuracy of ±0.2 °C for Ta and ±1% for RH. These measurements were stored in cloud-based storage. Sensors were placed in three locations: 10 m from the GWs in the middle of the street canyon and 1 m near each GW (see red circles in Figure 1b). The timing of the data collection during this study is presented in Figure 2c.2.3. Image ProcessingFigure 3 illustrates the image processing stages. The pre-processing of HS and TIR images involved their projection to each other using ArcGIS Pro software (version 3.0) and the extraction of Regions of Interest (ROIs) of approximately 13.5 m2 using the raster clip tool. The two plant species in the GW were separated (classified) due to their different phenological cycles, canopy closure characteristics, and vegetative properties. We employed the spectral angle mapper (SAM) supervised classification in ENVI software (version 5.6.1) to create a species mask for each GW (Figure 4). An image with a full green cover and without visible stress symptoms was selected for this purpose (north-facing: 14 September; south-facing: 24 August). Later, this mask was utilized to separate species in the HS and TIR time series analysis. After these pre-processing stages, the image processing flow was carried out using Python. The HS images were normalized (as described in Section 2.3.1), and all images (HS and TIR) were resized based on the smallest pixel found in each orientation time series.Figure 3. Illustration of image processing stages.Figure 4. Masks based on SAM classification for plant separation (ROI in red; mask contour in magenta) were used in the HS (NDVI, left) and TIR (∆T, right) time series analysis (see Section 2.3.1 and Section 2.3.2). (a) North-facing GW (14 September) and (b) south-facing GW (24 August).2.3.1. Hyperspectral (HS) Image ProcessingIn the HS images, the white reference was positioned at the lower part of the GW. To eliminate illumination differences along the GW, a pixel-based spectrum normalization (sometimes referred to as Norm-1) was performed as follows:R^ip=Rip/∑j=1204Rjp(1)where p is the pixel, and i and j are the bands. In the normalization process, each spectral band of a pixel is divided by the sum of all the pixel’s spectral bands, ensuring that the sum of all bands for a given pixel is equal to 1. This allows for relative comparisons and analysis of spectral information for the entire image, considering the proportion of each spectral band within a pixel.For each species, 12 vegetation indices (VIs) were calculated, as shown in Table 1. The VIs were organized into categories based on their sensitivity (pigment; leaf structure; water content) and their band’s range (VIS-RGB; VIS-HS; NIR + VIS; NIR). For further analysis, two separate branches were pursued. (a) In the first branch, a kernel technique was employed. For each VI image, the standard deviation (“STD kernel”) was computed within 10 × 10 pixels moving window. This process involved iterating over the entire image, extracting data from each window, and generating a time series of the average STD kernel values for all VIs separated into species. These time series were used for the ongoing monitoring of the GWs. (b) In the second branch, a time series of VIs was built. For noise reduction in each VI image, Gaussian Blurring (size of 5 × 5 pixels) was applied. This is a smoothing method that removes noise generated by Gaussian distribution [44]. These time series presented the average value for each VI, separated into species, and were used for the ongoing monitoring of the GWs and later to examine the potential of early detection of vegetation stress in VGS (see Section 2.4).Table 1. Vegetation indices separated into categories according to the VIs sensitivity.2.3.2. Thermal (TIR) Images ProcessingWater stress is known to be correlated with stomatal closure, resulting in reduced transpiration and elevated leaf temperatures above the ambient temperature [58,59]. The canopy-to-air temperature difference (∆T) is widely used as an indicator of plant health, heat stress tolerance, or drought stress in crops [60], and is calculated based on the TIR images as follows:∆T = Tcanopy − Ta(2)where Tcanopy is the temperature of vegetation at each pixel and Ta is the air temperature measured in situ, 1 m from each GW. Generally, if a plant has sufficient water, ∆T ≤ 0, whereas under water stress, ∆T > 0. Gaussian Blurring (5 × 5 pixels) was applied to the ∆T images to reduce noise, similar to what was done for the VIs images. The time series of ∆T were separated into species and used for the ongoing monitoring of the GWs and later for early detection of vegetation stress in VGS using TIR images.2.4. Stress Detection2.4.1. Yellowing Index and Ground TruthIn mid-October 2020 (south-facing GW—213) and mid-November 2020 (north-facing GW—212), the Viola hederacea plants along the GWs began to turn yellow and eventually died (Figure 5). In contrast, the Hedera helix plants, which are known as less sensitive plants, remained green and survived throughout the study and beyond. This period coincided with COVID-19 quarantine restrictions in Israel, and irrigation and fertilizer were not properly managed, likely contributing to vegetation degradation. The yellowing events caused significant damage to the GW, dissatisfaction among residents and passersby, and required extensive vegetation replacement using cranes. The time series of the Viola hederacea plants’ yellowing in both GWs are referred to as “yellowing events” in the study.Figure 5. Study area and yellowing events in the north (blue) and south-facing (orange) GWs.To investigate the usage of HS and TIR imaging for the early detection of stress events in the GWs, the yellowing areas in the time series were detected and delineated. A “yellowing index” for Viola hederacea was manually created to quantify the percentage of yellowing at each time step. This process involved visual observation of RGB and HS images, histogram investigation of yellow and green pixels, and examination of several RGB chlorophyll detection indices from the Sánchez-Sastre et al. [61] study (see Table A1 in Appendix A). The RGB r index (Table 1) was chosen to represent stressed vegetation. By setting a fixed threshold (based on histogram properties and visual inspection) of 0.3, the r index, hereafter referred to as the “yellowing index”, successfully captured yellow (r index value > 0.3) and green (r index value < 0.3) pixels. The yellowing index was analyzed for 10 time steps (from 24 September to 21 December at the north-facing GW and from 4 September to 1 December at the south-facing GW). One image per GW, close to the end of the yellowing event at each GW (14 December at the north-facing GW and 24 November at the south-facing GW), was selected as the reference image (ground truth) for stressed (yellow) pixels.2.4.2. Stress Detection in VIs and Thermal Index ImagesTo investigate the feasibility of detecting stress events before the visual stage (yellowing) in VGS, we classified the HS VIs and ∆T thermal index images into stressed and green pixels. For each VI (Table 1) and thermal index image in the 10 yellowing index time steps, we used an unsupervised Otsu threshold [62] and Multi-Otsu [63] to divide each image into two or three groups based on the presence of yellow pixels. When minimal or no yellow pixels were detected in the image (yellowing index < 0.5%), the data was split into two groups. Conversely, when yellow pixels were already present in the image (the yellow index was greater than 0.5%), the data was divided into three groups to increase sensitivity and allow for early detection of pre-yellowed stressed pixels. Separating into two groups only allowed the differentiation of yellow pixels from other pixels but could not detect the variance (stressed, non-stressed) in the rest of the image. For each time step, we classified the pixels as green, stressed, and yellow (if present).2.4.3. Stress Detection Performance EstimationTo evaluate the performance of the classifiers for early stress detection, we compared the classified (predicted: under stress or green) pixels from each HS VIs and ∆T index time step to the reference image (ground truth: yellow or green) and created a confusion matrix. The matrix was divided into four classes (Figure 6):True positive (TP): yellow pixels that were correctly predicted as under stress.False positive (FP): green pixels that were falsely predicted as under stress.True negative (TN): green pixels that were correctly predicted as green.False negative (FN): yellow pixels that were falsely predicted as green.Figure 6. Illustrations of the confusion matrix structure as used in this study. (a) Process of the calculated area. (b) Confusion matrix for yellow (under stress) and green (healthy) pixels as recognized by the ground truth (actual) and the VIs and thermal indices (predicted).The metrics that were used to describe the classifiers’ success for early stress detection based on the confusion matrix were: accuracy, precision, false positive rate (false alarm), and F1 score. Recall was also calculated for the F1 score calculation. The metrics were calculated as follows:Accuracy = (TP + TN)/(TP + FP + TN + FN)(3)Precision = TP/(TP + FP)(4)False positive rate (false alarm) = FP/(FP + TN)(5)Recall = TP/(TP + FN)(6)The F1 score, a single-value metric, combines precision and recall using the harmonic mean. It considers both false negatives and false positives, making it a useful metric for imbalanced data [64]. In this study, the F1 score was utilized to assess the classifier’s performance and ensure that the classification results were not merely due to random chance.3. Results3.1. Ongoing Monitoring of VGS Using HS and TIR ImagesThe average value of VIs allowed us to assess the general status of vegetation in VGS using remote and non-destructive methods. Figure 7 shows the time series of average VIs values and STD kernel from May to December 2020 for the two species in each GW. In both GWs, the VIs initially showed stable or minor changes in average values for several months. However, as the yellow visual symptoms appeared on the plants, there were noticeable changes in vegetation dynamics, with some VIs showing a rise while others demonstrated a drop, as well as a rise in standard deviation and STD kernel, all synchronized with the yellowing event.Figure 7. Average VIs and standard deviation (shading) time series of Viola hederacea (purple) and Hedera helix (green). The green (Hedera helix) and purple (Viola hederacea) dotted lines represent the STD kernel with values in the secondary y-axis. (a) North-facing and (b) south-facing GWs. The vertical yellow shading and red triangles indicate the yellowing events on 18 November in (a) and October 14 in (b). The dates (November–December) in (b) where the images were in shadow conditions are marked in black lines. The data in (b) of the Hedera helix on 1 November was dropped due to mixed shadowed and sunny conditions. See details of VIs in Table 1.For the north-facing GW (Figure 7a), the average NDVI and standard deviation were 0.84 and 0.017 (Viola hederacea), and 0.79 and 0.019 (Hedera helix), respectively, from the beginning of the monitoring until the yellowing event. Just before the yellowing event (14 October to 1 November), the averages increased even further, and the standard deviation decreased (0.87, 0.009 for Viola hederacea; 0.83, 0.012 for Hedera helix). At the onset of the yellowing event (18 to 24 November), the averages decreased to 0.84 (−3.4% for Viola hederacea) and 0.81 (−2.4% for Hedera helix), and the standard deviation increased to 0.049 (540% for Viola hederacea) and 0.044 (360% for Hedera helix) compared to the period just before the yellowing event. As the yellowing event progressed (1 to 21 December), the averages further decreased to 0.651 (−22% for Viola hederacea) and 0.759 (−6% for Hedera helix), and the standard deviation increased to 0.154 (314% for Viola hederacea) and 0.077 (175% for Hedera helix), compared to the beginning of the yellowing event. Similarly, the REIP and OSAVI averages decreased, and the standard deviation increased at the beginning of the yellowing event and beyond. The water content indices, WBI and NW-2, exhibited periodic changes throughout the study, with more drastic average decreases and standard deviation increases (WBI: −5.7%, 270%; NW-2: −15.7%, 300%) in Viola hederacea at the beginning of the yellowing. Other VIs were either not stable (e.g., r, G, PRI, NPQI, RVI, and mSR705) or very stable (e.g., SIPI) throughout the seasons, but also showed a decrease in average value and a drastic increase in standard deviation at the beginning of the yellowing event. Both species experienced decreases in average VIs and increases in standard deviation, indicating degradation of the entire GW during the yellowing event. Nevertheless, the changes in average and standard deviation values were more significant for Viola hederacea, and it eventually turned yellow and died. As for the STD kernel, the increase for both species began even before the beginning of the yellowing event (around 21 October) and continued to rise until the end of the time series. Some indices (e.g., NDVI, G, and PRI) exhibited a more synchronized response with the vegetation condition than others (e.g., NPQI, NWI-2, and mSR705).At the south-facing GW (Figure 7b), the NDVI averages and standard deviation were 0.77 and 0.013 (Viola hederacea), and 0.81 and 0.017 (Hedera helix) respectively from the beginning of the monitoring until the yellowing event, and 0.765 and 0.031 (Viola hederacea), and 0.788 and 0.032 (Hedera helix) just before the yellowing event (14 to 30 September). At the onset of the yellowing event (14 October), the average of both species dropped, and the standard deviation drastically increased by −12%, 387% (Viola hederacea), and −3.8%, 125% (Hedera helix) compared to the period just before the yellowing event. In this GW, the Viola hederacea yellowing event was much more intensive and was visually apparent from the beginning. Thus, the difference between the species is even more significant than in the north-facing GW. As the yellowing event progressed (21 October to 1 December), the averages continued to decrease to 0.578 (−14% for Viola hederacea) and 0.738 (−2.6% for Hedera helix). Several VIs (i.e., PRI, RVI, and mSR705) gradually decreased in both species throughout the monitoring period, which may indicate a gradual degradation in the entire GW vitality over the year. However, during the yellowing event, all VIs values sharply changed in average and standard deviation only for the Viola hederacea, which turned yellow, while Hedera helix changes were much more moderate. As for the STD kernel, the increase was more intense for Viola hederacea and started only at the beginning of the yellowing event (14 October) and continued to rise until the end of the time series. Like the north-facing GW, the STD kernels of the indices showed variable synchronization with the vegetation condition. However, unlike the north-facing GW, the STD kernel did not increase before the yellowing event.During the study period, the north-facing GW remained entirely shaded, while the south-facing GW was fully exposed to sunlight during midday. Due to seasonal changes in the sun’s position, the south-facing GW (213) was entirely shaded in the last two images (24 November and 1 December), and partially shaded at the bottom of the GW (mainly at the Hedera helix areas) in the third image from the end (1 November). The shading conditions affected several pigment VIs in the last (2–3) images in the time series (Figure 7b). For example, PRI and NPQI sharply decreased during the yellowing event but started to increase on 1 November, even though the yellowing event continued. Due to the mixed sun-shadow conditions in the 1 November image, noisy values were observed in PRI, NPQI, WBI, and NW-2 in the Hedera helix dataset. Therefore, we excluded this time step from the time series. The complete time series data, including the excluded time step, can be found in Figure A1 in Appendix A.Figure 8 presents the average ∆T of the two species for each GW. Data from the thermal camera is missing from 24 September until 21 October and on 23 June (north-facing GW) due to a technical problem (see Section 2.2). From the ∆T time series, it is evident that the north-facing GW (212) did not exhibit drastic changes in ∆T, except toward the end of the time series when ∆T began to rise as the GW yellowing progressed. This rise was observed in both species, although Hedera helix did not undergo yellowing. Conversely, at the south-facing GW, the ∆T index exhibited a consistent rise and was even slightly higher for the Hedera helix. Following the commencement of the yellowing event, ∆T in Viola hederacea continued to increase and surpassed that of Hedera helix. Data was unavailable before and after the commencement of the yellowing event, introducing uncertainty for this perio', 'unique_identifier': 271}\n",

Jelenleg még nem fejlesztettek ki olyan univerzális módszert, amely a magas vagy alacsony talajnedvesség-zónák szántóföldi léptékű feltérképezésére alkalmas úgy, hogy a talajnak és a talajnedvesség áramlásának teljes zavarásmentességét nagy mélységben is biztosítja.A talajnedvesség-mérés részben (talajkapcsolt), vagy teljesen roncsolásmentes (levegőkapcsolt) lehetőségét biztosítja a földradar (GPR), amely nagy felbontást és jelentős behatolási mélységet biztosít a közepes léptékű talajnedvesség meghatározáshoz, így hiánypótló technikát jelent a kisléptékű pontszerű és a nagyléptékű távérzékelt mérési technikák közötti metodikai hiány kitöltésére. Emellett jobb időhatékonyággal alkalmazható más roncsolásos és roncsolásmentes eljárásokkal összevetve.A talajradart sikeresen alkalmazták a talajnedvesség-meghatározásra, de hidrológiai vizsgálatokban történő alkalmazásának nagy potenciálja ellenére nem minden körülmény között működik optimálisan. Felhasználhatósága többnyire olyan területekre korlátozódik, ahol viszonylag alacsony az elektromos vezetőképesség (az elektromágneses hullám gyenge csillapodására való tekintettel). Ezen túlmenően egyes talajradar módszerek működésének alapfeltétele a jól azonosítható és folyamatos jelvisszaverődés, továbbá a dielektromos állandó tekintetében a földradar-rendszerek térben folyamatos felszín alatti kontrasztot igényelnek.A talajnedvesség és annak áramlása kulcsparaméter a mezőgazdaság különböző területein. A talajnedvesség (és a talajvíz) látja el a növényeket, ami elengedhetetlen feltétele a növények fejlődésének. Ennélfogva a talaj nedvességtartalmának, eloszlásának, áramlásának, valamint a beszivárgás sajátosságainak alapos és lokális ismerete az öntözés hatékony megvalósításának alapköve, különösen a félszáraz és száraz éghajlatú területeken.A talajradar mérési alapjaival, valamint hasznosítási lehetőségeivel összefüggésben az elsősorban nemzetközi szakirodalmat összegezve megállapítható, hogy a GPR előnyös mérőeszköz lehet, amely segíthet a talaj nedvességeloszlásának feltérképezésében, tekintettel a beszivárgásra, a párolgás és a növényi vízfelvétel okozta vízveszteségre is. Következésképpen mezőgazdasági felhasználhatósága lehetséges.A talajradar hasznos része lehet a „Smart farming”-nak (intelligens gazdálkodás), segítséget nyújthat a talajban elhelyezett talajnedvesség-mérő szenzorok kijelölésében. Különösen, ha a közelmúltban megjelent új, szimultán többeltolásos és többcsatornás (SiMoc) GPR rendszerre asszociálunk, amely gyors talajprofil-feltérképezést tesz lehetővé a hét vevőegységével, de a hagyományos egycsatornás GPR sebességével.Ha a teljes roncsolásmentesség a cél, úgy a drónra szerelt levegőkapcsolt GPR-ek nyújthatnak lehetőséget. Megjegyzendő azonban, hogy a talaj-levegő határfelületen jelentkező szignifikáns jelcsillapodás (hullámszóródás) következtében a feltárási mélység jelentősen csökken.A földradar végső soron mérési alapul szolgálhat a hatékony (precíziós) öntözési gazdálkodás kialakításához, és a megfelelő vízfelhasználási hatékonyságot biztosítva járulhat hozzá a precíziós mezőgazdasági programok megvalósításához.BevezetésKorunk egyik legégetőbb globális kérdése az élelmiszertermelés szempontjából, hogy meddig tudjuk élelemmel ellátni az egyre növekvő népességet egyre kevesebb (és gyakran gyengébb minőségű) rendelkezésre álló termőterületről (FAO, 2020). A kulcs a növényi erőforrás-felhasználás hatékonyságának folyamatos fejlődése (MORISON et al., 2008), és a termőtalajok minőségének javítása (LIU et al., 2015).A Föld vízkészletének csak 0,0012%-át képezi a földfelszín közeli talajnedvesség (VANDER & CASEY, 2010), azonban a hidrológiai folyamatok egyik kulcsparamétere, amely befolyásolja a vízcserét és az energiaáramlást a földfelszín/légkör határfelületen (SHUKLA & GARG, 2014). Szántóföldi körülmények között a talajnedvesség a növények fejlődésében kulcsparaméter, a termény minőségét leginkább meghatározó faktorok egyike (KLOTZSCHE et al., 2018). Legnagyobb kihívást a száraz és félszáraz régiók jelentik, ahol a felszín alatti vízforrásokat, különösen a víztartó rétegeket használják öntözésre, mivel a csapadék csak egy részét fedezi a termőnövények párologtatási veszteségének (NEUPANE & WENXUAN, 2019).A talajban tárolt nedvesség mennyisége a talaj szemcseméret-eloszlásától, szerkezetétől, porozitásától, tömörödöttségének fokától, a termőrétegének vastagságától, ásványi összetételétől, sótartalmától, szennyezettségétől, szervesanyag tartalmától, illetve a légkör hőmérsékletétől és a páratartalmától is függ (MUNOTH et al., 2016).A talajnedvesség-tartalom jelen cikk esetében a térfogati talajvíztartalmat jelenti, ami az adott talajban lévő víz térfogatának, a teljes talajtérfogathoz viszonyított aránya egy egységre vonatkoztatva (TOSTI & SLOB, 2015). A talajnedvesség és annak tér- és időbeli változása több tudományterület, így az ökológia, mezőgazdaság, hidrológia és mérnöki tudományok (pl.: talajok, talajfelszín alatti rétegek kutatásai) kulcsparamétere, ezért meghatározza a csapadéknak a beszivárgásra, felszíni lefolyásra jutó részét, ezáltal az erózió, vízfolyás-vízhozam, és a talajvíz-utánpótlódás arányait (KLOTZSCHE et al., 2018).A talajnedvességtartalom-meghatározási eljárásoknál (áttekintés a következő fejezetben) jelenleg is hiányosság van a nagyléptékű, azaz pontszerű (<0,01 m2), és a kis/közepes léptékű, vagyis távérzékelt (>100 m2) mérési lehetőségek között. A két véglet közötti (0,01–100 m2) hiány áthidalását jelentheti a szántóföldi léptékű alkalmazást biztosító földradar (vagy talajradar – ground penetrating radar; GPR) (SHUKLA & GARG, 2014; TOSTI & SLOB, 2015).A GPR mérések sikeres mezőgazdasági alkalmazásának két fő követelménye a felszín alatti első méterig való behatolás képessége és a centiméteres felbontás (LOMBARDI et al., 2022).Jelen cikk célja a talajnedvesség-tartalom földradarral történő mérési, valamint mezőgazdasági alkalmazhatósági lehetőségeinek bemutatása, összefoglalva a legfontosabb, elsősorban nemzetközi szakirodalmat.Talajnedvesség-meghatározási módszerekA talajnedvesség meghatározásának legelterjedtebb, hagyományos, leginkább kutatott, ugyanakkor nagyszámú minta esetén munkaigényes, direkt eljárású lehetősége a magfúrásokra alkalmazott termogravimetrikus eljárás (hőelemzési technika, ahol a vizsgált mintát standard 105 °C-on tömegállandóságig szárítják, és az így mért abszolút száraz tömegre vonatkoztatják a tömeg%-os nedvességtartalmat). A módszerrel a talaj térfogattömegének (vagy térfogatsűrűségének) mérése alapján konvertálhatók a kapott tömegarányos, (vagy tömeg%-os) nedvességtartalom eredmények térfogatarányos, (vagy térfogat%-os) értékekké (STEELMAN & ENDRES, 2012; TOSTI & SLOB, 2015).A kevesebb roncsolással járó, indirekt módszerek közé sorolhatók a nukleáris eljárások, mint a gamma sugárgyengítéses módszerek, vagy a finomabb kalibrációt biztosító neutronszonda (KLOTZSCHE et al., 2018), valamint az elektromágneses szenzorok. Ezen utóbbi csoportba tartoznak a dielektromos és kapacitás alapú technikák: a legismertebbek közül például a magasfrekvenciás impedancia mérést lehetővé tevő kapacitás szonda, az időtartománybeli reflexiómérés (Time Domain Reflectometry; TDR), és a frekvencia-tartománybeli reflexiómérés (Frequency Domain Reflectometry; FDR). Az elektromágneses szenzorok közé tartoznak továbbá az elektromos ellenállás és elektromos vezetőképesség alapú technikák (1. ábra). Az alkalmazott technikák közül érdemes még megemlíteni a hőimpulzusszenzorokat, tenziométereket és a gipszblokkok-nylonelemek elektromos vezetőképességének mérését is (TOSTI & SLOB, 2015).VIEW FULL SIZE1. ábraTalajnedvesség-meghatározási módszerek csoportosításaCitation: Agrokémia és Talajtan 72, 2; 10.1556/0088.2023.00144Download FigureDownload figure as PowerPoint slideTeljesen roncsolásmentes talajnedvesség-vizsgálatot tesz lehetővé a távérzékelési eszközök alkalmazása, ahol a műszerek nem érintkeznek a talajjal. Továbbá a nagyobb területi lefedettségre vonatkozó méréseket is lehetővé teszik (100 m2 – 100 km2) (ROBINSON et al., 2008). A talajnedvesség távérzékelés alapú meghatározása elsősorban mikrohullámú szenzorokkal történik. Mivel mind a passzív, mind az aktív mikrohullámok érzékenyek a víz dielektromos állandójára, ami befolyásolja azok emissziós képességét és visszaverődését, lehetővé téve ezzel a felszíni talajnedvesség mérését. Az aktív érzékelő mikrohullámú impulzust bocsájt ki és fogad, míg a passzív érzékelő a természetes hőkibocsájtást rögzíti a föld felszínéről.A spektrumtartomány alapján optikai (VIS – VISible – látható fény; NIR – Near Infrared közeli hullámhosszú infravörös), termális (LWIR – Long WaveLength Infrared – hosszú hullámhosszú infravörös), valamint mikrohullám típus (passzív és aktív) különíthető el.A spektroszkópiai módszer elve az elektromágneses sugárzási energia és az anyag közötti kölcsönhatáson alapul. A talaj fizikai és kémiai jellemzőinek – például vízmolekuláknak – jelenléte miatt az elektromágneses sugárzás az egyes molekuláris kötések rezgését idézi elő. A rezgések révén a fény elnyelődik egy frekvenciához kötött, meghatározott energiakvantummal, lehetővé téve a talaj tulajdonságainak elemzését (PRADIPTA et al., 2022a; SHUKLA & GARG, 2014).Az aktív mikrohullámú érzékelők nagyobb térbeli feloldóképességgel bírnak, mint a passzív mikrohullámúak, ezért felhasználásuk egy farm gazdaság szintjén célszerű (amelyek átlagos területe 1,8 km2 az USA-ban). A passzív mikrohullámú szenzorok a helyi vagy regionális szintű mezőgazdasági döntéshozatalban hasznosak (PRADIPTA et al., 2022b).A növénytakaró és a talaj jellemzői jelentősen befolyásolhatják a talajnedvesség-meghatározás pontosságát, úgy, hogy a szenzor érzékenysége a növényzet sűrűségének növekedésével csökken. Általában ez a probléma minimálisra csökkenthető hosszabb hullámhossz használatával. A műhold alapú távérzékelés fő korlátja, hogy nem képes megragadni a talajnedvesség dinamikáját a mélyebb talajzónában (gyökérzóna talajnedvesség), ami a gyökérvízfelvétel és a talaj hidraulikus paraméterei szempontjából lényeges információ (PRADIPTA et al., 2022b).Az optikai és termikus szenzorok kombinációja (optikai-termikus), az úgynevezett hőmérséklet-növényzet háromszög megközelítés. Alapelve, hogy a talajnedvesség szorosan összefügg a földfelszín hőmérsékletével és a vegetációs indexszel (PRADIPTA et al., 2022b).A felszíni talajnedvesség mérés konkrét, távérzékelési alapú termékei, mikrohullám szenzor esetén a SMAP_SM (Soil Moisture Active Passive) (9 km-es térbeli felbontás); az AMSR2 SM (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2) (25 km-es térbeli felbontás). A MODIS_LST (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer_Land Surface Temperature), mint termikus (1 km-es térbeli felbontással) és a MODIS_ Surface Reflectance, mint optikai (250 m-es térbeli felbontás), továbbá a Sentinel-1 és -2 Landsat-8 OLI & TIRS (ahol a Sentinel-1: 15 m, míg a Sentinel-2: 10–60 m térbeli felbontásúak), az előbbi esetén mikrohullám, optikai és termális, utóbbi esetén pedig optikai és termális szenzorokról beszélhetünk. A gyökérzóna talajnedvesség-feltérképezésének, távérzékelés alapú termékei mikrohullám-optikai szenzor esetén a SMAP SM, SMOS SSM (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity Surface Soil Moisture) (35 km-es térbeli felbontás), SMOS_RZSM (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity Root Zone Soil Moisture), MODIS LST, MODIS Surface Reflectance (PRADIPTA et al., 2022b). Itt jegyezzük meg, hogy a terepi módszerek mindig pontosabbak, mint a távérzékelés alapú, közvetett adatgyűjtési eljárások.Kiemelendők a geofizikai módszerek, amelyek kifejezetten érzékenyek a talaj elektromos tulajdonságainak változásaira, a dielektromos permittivitásra vagyis „áteresztőképességre” és/vagy az elektromos vezetőképességre. Fő előnyük, hogy minimális roncsolással vagy teljesen roncsolásmentesen kivitelezhetők, és jelentős területet (1–80 km2) képesek lefedni. A mezőgazdasági alkalmazás tekintetében, a geofizikai módszereken belül az elektromos ellenállás (ERT), az elektromágneses indukció (EMI), illetve a jelen cikk tárgyát képező földradar (GPR) a legszélesebb körben alkalmazott technikák. A GPR esetén az elektromágneses hullámoknak – rádióspektrum, mikrohullám tartomány – a talajba történő kibocsájtása, majd detektálása történik (TOSTI & SLOB, 2015). A precíziós gazdálkodás területén legelterjedtebben a GPR-t alkalmazzák, mivel a módszer érzékeny a vizsgált közeg (talaj) permittivitási és vezetőképességi tulajdonságaira is (LOMBARDI et al., 2022).GPR alkalmazhatósága talajnedvesség-tartalom méréséreA földradar egy részben, vagy teljesen roncsolásmentes eljárás, amely nagy horizontális és vertikális felbontást tesz lehetővé. Alacsony veszteségű anyagok, például a homok maximális elérhető függőleges felbontása nagyfrekvenciás (900 MHz-es) antennával 2–8 cm (NEAL, 2004). Másik előnye, hogy jelentős, akár 50 méteres behatolási mélység is elérhető vele (XINBO et al., 2019). A GPR-t számos tudományterületen sikeresen alkalmazzák, így például a régészetben és a kultúrmérnöki tudományokban felszín alatti objektumok, például védőgátak állapotának feltérképezésére (SHEISHAH et al., 2022), vagy útpályaszerkezetelemzéshez (TOSTI & SLOB, 2015; PRIMUSZ & TÓTH, 2021). Ez utóbbi kapcsán HERCEG (2022) mutatja be az útpályaszerkezetek földműveinek vizsgálatára alkalmazható GPR alapú talajnedvesség-tartalom meghatározásának szakirodalmát.A talajvizsgálatok során, a GPR leggyakoribb alkalmazása a talajnedvesség meghatározása, a nedvességtartalom elektromágneses jelterjedést befolyásoló tulajdonsága miatt (ZAJÍCOVÁ & CHUMAN, 2019; PATHIRANA et al., 2023).A GPR nagyfrekvenciás (többnyire 10–1200 MHz-es) elektromágneses hullámokat használ a vizsgálandó közegben lévő célobjektumok detektálására (DANIELS, 2004). A GPR adó egysége elektromágneses hullámimpulzusokat bocsájt a vizsgálandó közegbe, a vevő egysége a visszavert jeleket fogadja, amit bisztatikus kialakításnak neveznek. A földradar elsődlegesen időt mér, az úgynevezett kétirányú futás idejét (HUISMAN et al., 2003). Ezt bővebben a GPR alapú talajnedvességmérési módszerek c. fejezet tárgyalja.A földradar kifejezetten érzékeny a talajtextúrára, és a talaj elektromos vezetőképességére (HUISMAN et al., 2003), ezért felhasználhatósága többnyire olyan területekre korlátozódik, ahol viszonylag alacsony a talaj elektromos vezetőképessége, gyenge az elektromágneses hullám csillapodása (KLOTZSCHE et al., 2018).A földradar két főparamétere a felbontás, és a behatolási mélység. Felbontása, annak központi frekvenciájával együtt nő (XINBO et al., 2019). A GPR mérések esetén a sávszélesség értéke alapvetően 10 és 1200 MHz közé esik. A feltárható mélység a vizsgálandó talaj elektromos konduktivitásának, és a GPR központi frekvenciájának függvénye. Alacsony vezetőképességű közeg (száraz homok, kavics) esetén az alacsony frekvenciás GPR rendszerek (pl. 50 vagy 100 Mhz-es) néhány 10 méteres, de akár 50 méteres behatolási mélységet is képesek elérni (DOOLITTLE et al., 2007). A magas frekvenciás típusok (pl.: 450 vagy 900 MHz) pár méteres behatolási mélységet valósíthatnak meg. A GPR azonban nem megfelelő eszköz szikes talajokon, ahol a behatolási mélység jellemzően 25 cm-nél kisebb. Kőzetlisztes homok vagy agyag esetén is jelentősen csökken a behatolási mélység. A nedves agyagokban kifejezetten kedvezőtlenek a lehetőségek a talajnedvesség-tartalom meghatározására, mert ezeknél a behatolási mélység jellemzően kevesebb, mint 1 m (DOOLITTLE et al., 2007).SCHROTT és SASS (2008) rámutat, hogy a meredek és sziklás terepfelszín a GPR antennák nagy méretei miatt gyakorlatilag lehetetlenné teszi azok alkalmazását. Emellett az erdőállományok földradar alapú vizsgálata is korlátozott, hiszen a fák gyökérzete, mint visszaverődést okozó felületek, hibás mérési adatokat generálnak. Míg a fák gyökérzetének talajradarral történő feltérképezéséről az elmúlt 20 évben számos tanulmány született, addig a mezőgazdasági termőnövények gyökérzetének vizsgálatával csak korlátozott számú közlemény foglalkozott (SHUKLA & GARG, 2014).A DOOLITTLE és munkatársai (2007) által bemutatott talajalkalmassági térképek információt adnak azokról a talajtulajdonságokról, amelyek befolyásolják a földradar alkalmazhatóságát. Ezeket a térképeket az Egyesült Államokban fejlesztették ki a talaj elektromos vezetőképességének adatai alapján, amelyet a talaj agyagtartalma, nátrium-abszorpciós aránya és kalcium-karbonát-tartalma befolyásol (LIU et al., 2016).Hazai kutatásként ki kell emeljük NÁDASI és munkatársai (2020) munkásságát, akik Magyarország földradar-alkalmazhatósági térképét készítették el. Öt osztályt különítettek el úgy, hogy az első jelenti a legalkalmasabbat, míg az ötödik jelenti a legkevésbé alkalmasat. Az alkalmassági osztályok meghatározásánál a radarhullámok terjedését gátló tényezők, mint jelző faktorok, jelentették az alapot, ami elsősorban a víz felszínközeli jelenléte (vagy hiánya), az agyagtartalom, az oldott ionok potenciális mennyisége, a szikesedés és a kémhatás. A NÁDASI et al. (2020) által közölt alkalmassági térkép rámutat, hogy Magyarországon a GPR mérésekre kimondottan, illetve közepesen alkalmas területek aránya a teljes területhez viszonyítva megközelítőleg 15–15%. Körülbelül 50%-ra tehető a kevésbé alkalmas, míg 20%-ra az alkalmatlan területek aránya. Jó területeknek számítanak a Duna-Tisza köze, valamint a Nyírség homok szövetű talajai.A GPR mérési elveA dielektromos állandó (valós része) (𝜀𝑟) egy anyag vákuumhoz viszonyított elektromos térerősség-tárolási kapacitását adja meg. Értéke a háromfázisú polidiszperz rendszerben széles skálán mozoghat, így a cseppfolyós halmazállapotú (szabad, vagy másnéven gravitációs) víz értéke a hőmérséklet függvényében 78–88 közötti (a magasabb hőmérséklet a polarizáció erősödésével csökkenti a permittivitást), a talajlevegő értéke kb. 1, míg a szilárd fázisok kb. 3–10 közöttiek (CASSIDY, 2009; HUISMAN et al., 2003; STEELMAN & ENDRES, 2012). A három talajalkotó fázis közti szignifikáns különbség főként a vízmolekulák jelentős polarizálhatóságának köszönhető (TOSTI & SLOB, 2015). A higroszkópos (adszorpciós) víz esetében a permittivitás 4 alá is csökkenhet (SAARENKETO, 1998), a kapilláris víz permittivitása pedig a szabad víz és a higroszkópos értékei között található. Ezt a hatást a nagy fajlagos felülettel rendelkező részecskék (agyag vagy humusz) okozzák, melyeknek nagyobb a vízmolekulákat megkötő potenciáljuk; ezért a vízmolekulák nem képesek válaszreakcióba lépni az elektromágneses mezővel, és így csökken a talaj dielektromos permittivitása (LAUER et al., 2010).A talajra jellemző jelentős dielektromos állandó különbség teszi lehetővé a GPR-ek mérőeszközként való használatát a talajnedvesség-tartalom meghatározásában (XINBO et al., 2019). A telítetlen talajok dielektromos permittivitása elsősorban a talaj víztartalmától függ, azonban más tényezők, mint a litológia, a hőmérséklet, az ionkoncentráció és a pórusfolyadék összetétele szintén befolyásolják azt (LOMBARDI & MAURIZIO, 2019).Itt jegyezzük meg, hogy a talaj dielektromos permittivitása a talaj szervesanyagtartalmának emelkedésével csökken, ami a talaj, adott térfogategységnyi súlyának csökkenéséből következik. A száraz biomassza dielektromos permittivitása 1-hez közeli értékű, ami a lebomlással növekszik (ZAJÍCOVÁ & CHUMAN, 2019).GPR alapú talajnedvesség-mérési módszerekSzámos, a nedvességérzékelést megcélzó GPR-alapú módszert fejlesztettek ki különböző alkalmazási területekre és anyagokra, így a természetes (módon kialakuló) talajokra is (LAMBOT & ANDRÉ, 2014).Az elmúlt évtizedekben a földradar egy lehetséges, nagy hatékonysággal alkalmazható műszere volt a telítetlen zónák hidrológiai feltárásának, a vízkészlet kutatásoknak (TOSTI & SLOB, 2015), a talajrétegek azonosításának (DAVIS & ANNAN, 1989), a felszín alatti hidraulikai paraméterek feltérképezésének (HUBBARD, et al. 1997), a talajvízszint lokalizálásának (NAKASHIMA et al., 2001), és természetesen a jelen cikk tárgyát képező talajnedvesség-tartalom mérésnek is (HUISMAN et al., 2003; KLOTZSCHE et al., 2018).A GPR-alapú talajnedvesség-mérési módszerek területén, a közelmúltban elért kutatási eredményeket XINBO és munkatársai (2019) mutatják be az alapelvek, előnyök, korlátok, valamint alkalmazási lehetőségek tekintetében. A szerzők hét elterjedt mérési technikát demonstrálnak, név szerint a visszavert hullám, a talajhullám, a felszíni visszaverődés, a fúrólyuk GPR technika, teljes hullámforma inverzió, átlagos burkológörbe amplitúdó és frekvencia eltolás.Hardver tekintetében talajkapcsolt GPR-t és levegőkapcsolt földradar antenna kialakítást különíthetünk el. Előbbi esetén az eszköz a talajjal közvetlenül érintkezik, ezért ez a megvalósítás csak a felszín alatt roncsolásmentes. Az adatminőséget a talaj felületérdessége, a vegetáció, az antenna pozícionálásakor esetlegesen fellépő akadályok befolyásolják (HUISMAN et al., 2003).A felszínvisszaverődés módszer levegőkapcsolt antennával működik, ezért teljes roncsolásmentességet biztosít. A technika alkalmas a talajnedvesség nagy térbeli felbontással kivitelezett feltárására, emiatt azonban néhány cm-re szűkül a feltárási mélység, továbbá érzékennyé válik a felszínborítottságra, felületérdességre, (XINBO et al., 2019), ami az érdesség-modell integrálásával javítható (KLOTZSCHE et al., 2018).Az elterjedt földradar-technikák adatgyűjtési és adatfeldolgozási metódusát tekintve a visszavert hullám, a talajhullám és a fúrólyuk GPR módszerek esetén először a rendelkezésre álló radarhullámok átlagos sebességének meghatározása szükséges (a GPR által kibocsájtott elektromágneses hullám jel kétirányú futási idejéből meghatározva), amelyet a dielektromos állandó, majd a talajnedvesség számításához használnak. A felszín-visszaverődés módszerrel a reflexiós együttható (a levegő és a talaj felszíne közötti határfelületről történő visszaverődés amplitúdóból meghatározva) és a talaj dielektromos állandója között határoznak meg összefüggést; a teljes hullámforma inverzió és az átlagos burkológörbe amplitúdó módszerekkel viszont a radarjelekből közvetlenül is meghatározható a talaj dielektromos állandója. A dielektromos állandó alapú módszerek átszámítási képletet igényelnek (bővebben a „Petrofizikai összefüggések” fejezetben) a talaj dielektromos állandójának talajnedvességgé alakításához, továbbá terepi kalibrációt (STEELMAN & ENDRES, 2012). A szokványos megközelítéstől eltér a frekvenciaeltoláson alapuló módszer, amely a talajnedvességet a FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation) révén kapja meg.A talaj, GPR alapú nedvességtartalom meghatározásának pontossága – a talajviszonyoktól és a talajradar antenna konfigurációjától függően – 0,0026 cm3 cm–3 (STOFFREGEN et al., 2002) és 0,115 cm3 cm–3 (WEIHERMÜLLER et al., 2007) között változhat.A GPR módszerek mérési pontossága mellett a precíz, térbeli pozicionálása is kiemelt szerepet kap, amit a legtöbb GPR-rendszer ma már lehetővé tesz a GPS-rendszerekkel való plug-and-play kapcsolat segítségével.A közelmúltban kereskedelmi forgalomba került műholdas kommunikációs jelvétel alapú GPS rendszer az „European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service” (EGNOS) és a „Wide Area Augmentation System” (WAAS), melyekkel akár 0,04 m abszolút pozíciópontosság érhető el (KLOTZSCHE et al., 2018).Petrofizikai összefüggésekA dielektromos állandón alapuló módszereknél a talaj dielektromos állandóját határozzák meg első körben, majd abból helyszíni kalibrációval, vagy empirikus módon a talajnedvességet petrofizikai összefüggés segítségével.A petrofizikai összefüggéseknek 3 csoportja ismeretes: empirikus összefüggések, térfogati keveréses formulák, effektív közeg megközelítések.TOPP et al. (1980), ROTH et al. (1990), NADLER et al. (1991), JACOBSEN és SCHJONNING (1993) rámutattak, hogy a terepi és laboratóriumi mérés alapú, kevésbé összetett empirikus megközelítések, a talaj szerkezeti tulajdonságairól (pl. térfogatsűrűség, porozitás, pórusszerkezet stb.) csak korlátozott információt igényelnek.A térfogati keverés formulák, a háromfázisú talaj-levegő-víz rendszer térfogati összetevőit és dielektromos állandóját veszik alapul a kapcsolat felállítására. Ilyen például a CRIM (Complex Refractive Index Model) modell (DOBSON et al., 1985; JONES & FRIEDMAN, 2000).Az effektív közeg megközelítések figyelembe veszik egy kompozit anyag textúrális és szerkezeti hozzájárulását annak dielektromos állandójához (TYČ et al., 1988; FRIEDMAN, 1998; ENDRES & BERTRAND, 2006).Jelen cikkben a két legelterjedtebb, a nemzetközi szakirodalomban leggyakrabban előforduló empirikus petrofizikai összefüggést, vagyis a Topp és Roth egyenleteket vázoljuk (ROTH et al., 1992; TOPP et al., 1980; STEELMAN & ENDRES, 2012).θsoil=−5,3*10−2+2,92*10−2εsoil−5,5*10−4ε2soil+4,3*10−6ε3soil (1a)ahol 𝜃𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙: térfogati talajnedvesség, 𝜀𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙: talaj dielektromos állandójaA Topp-egyenletet empirikus módon határozták meg a különböző fizikai talajféleségekre (különböző textúrával rendelkező ásványi talajokra), de elsősorban homokos talajok esetén alkalmazható (TOPP et al., 1980; STOFFREGEN et al., 2002). Pontossága JACOBSEN és SCHIJONNING (1994) validációja alapján: 0,022 m3 m–3ROTH et al. (1992) TDR segítségével ásványi, szerves és mágneses tulajdonsággal rendelkező talajokra alkalmazható empirikus összefüggést alkotott, 0,015 m3 m–3 előrejelzési hibával:θ=−7,28⋅10−2+4,48⋅10−2εr−19,5⋅10−4ε2r+36,1⋅10−6ε3r (1b)STEELMAN és ENDRES (2012) a talajnedvesség és a dielektromos állandó közötti kőzetfizikai összefüggések hatékonyságát vizsgálták. A GPR terepi mérések homokra, homokos vályogra és iszapos vályogra irányultak. A teljes adatsort nézve ROTH et al. (1990) összefüggése mellett TOPP és munkatársai (1980) adták a legpontosabb előrejelzést a talajnedvesség-tartalomról 0,052 m3 m–3 négyzetes hibával (RMSE: root mean square error).DEIANA és munkatársai (2008) a beszivárgás hatására létrejövő lefelé irányuló vízáramlást vizsgálták kiterjedt vadózus zónákban, GPR segítségével. A szerzők rámutattak, hogy legtöbb tanulmány a természetes infiltrációhoz kapcsolódóan kis (max. 0,03 cm3 cm–3) talajnedvesség változásokat jelzett. Meg kell jegyezni azonban, hogy a GPR-vizsgálatokat túlnyomórészt alacsony elektromos vezetőképességű talajokon végezték, amelyek jellemzően alacsony vízmegtartó képességgel is rendelkeznek (KLOTZSCHE et al., 2018).GPR mérési technika számítási menete (visszavert hullám módszerrel)A GPR adóegysége által kibocsájtott elektromágneses hullámok visszaverődnek, illetve megtörnek a levegő/talajfelszín határfelületen és/vagy két eltérő dielektromos tulajdonságú talajrétegen, majd levegő-, talaj-, visszavert vagy megtört hullámként érik el a vevőegységet. HUISMAN et al. (2003) rámutatnak, hogy a visszavert hullám sebessége a talaj elektromos értelemben vett áteresztőképességétől, dielektromos állandójától függ, ha kis vezetőképességű és nemmágneses talajt vizsgálunk:vsoil=c√εsoil (2)ahol, 𝑣𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙: a visszavert hullám talajban történő átlagos terjedési sebessége, 𝜀𝑠𝑜𝑖𝑙: talaj dielektromos állandója, c: elektromágneses hullám vákuumban való terjedési sebessége (2,9979 108 m s–1)Amennyiben a mélység ismert, akkor a vevőegységbe érkező hullámok kétirányú futásidejéből meghatározható a vizsgált zóna (itt talaj) átlagos talajnedvesség-tartalma a következő egyenlettel:vsoil=2dtrw (3)ahol, 𝑡𝑟𝑤: a visszavert hullám kétirányú futásideje, d: vizsgált réteg mélységeHa az adó és a vevőegység között jelentős a távolság, akkor a (3) egyenlet módosul (HUISMAN et al., 2003; TOSTI & SLOB, 2015):vsoil=2√d2+(0.5a)2trw (4)ahol, 𝑎: antennatávolságA bemutatott számítás a talajfelszín és a visszaverő felület közti réteg (talajszelvény) talajnedvességét reprezentálja, amin a hullám áthalad.A visszavert- és a talajhullám értelmezésekor idealizált esetben homogén talajnedvességeloszlást feltételezünk, azonban a valós terepi viszonyok nem mindig egyszerűsíthetők le ennyire. Kifejezetten igaz ez az olyan dinamikus hidrológiai folyamatok esetén, mint a beszivárgás, a kapillaritás vagy az olvadás, ahol a vékony rétegek közötti erős kontraszt és a permittivitás gradiense lényegesen befolyásolhatják a földradar válaszjelét (KLOTZSCHE et al., 2018).A földradar mezőgazdasági alkalmazhatósága a talaj nedvességtartalmának meghatározásáraAz éghajlatváltozás főként a globális felmelegedéssel, szárazodással tipizálható. (IPCC, 2022). A világszintű, ugyanakkor régiónként eltérő hőmérsékletemelkedés következményeként az evapotranszspiráció (ET), a csapadék és a légköri vízgőztartalom tér és időbeli változékonysága is fokozódik. Ez a talaj nedvességtartalmának ingadozását és a teljes hidrológiai ciklus felerősödését okozza. Globális szinten a 21. század eleje óta az evapotranszspiráció meghaladja a csapadék mennyiségét (DENG et al., 2020).Hazánkra, a minimum- és maximumhőmérsékletek 21. század végi emelkedése mellett, a csapadék szabálytalan eloszlása jellemző. Elviekben a heves csapadékesemények és a súlyos szárazság előfordulása egyaránt valószínű, a gyakorlatban azonban az 1980-as évek óta egyre gyakrabban fordul elő aszály, amely elsősorban a vegetációs időszakot sújtja (GÁLOS et al., 2015; MÁTYÁS et al., 2018).A fokozódó aszály miatt a vízgazdálkodási feladatok aránya nő. A 2021 végére országosan 112 állomással rendelkező Operatív Aszály- és Vízhiánykezelő Monitoringrendszer magában foglalja és ingyenesen elérhetővé teszi a talajnedvesség-mérő monitoringhálózat adatait, a védekezési fokozatok elrendeléséhez szükséges (napi) meteorológiai és talajnedvesség adatokat is tartalmazó kombinált aszályindexet, az ezekre épülő elemzéseket, kármentesítési terveket, és védekezési fokozatokat. A rendelkezésre álló adatok révén így napi szintű tájékoztatás kapható a vízhiány (aszály) aktuális helyzetéről és várható tendenciáiról (FIALA et al., 2018).A mezőgazdaság fenntarthatóságának – ahol a növényi erőforrás-felhasználás hatékonysága folyamatosan fejlődik – meghatározó tényezője a rendelkezésre álló víz mellett (MORISON et al., 2008) a termőtalaj minősége (LIU et al., 2015). A növények gyökérzete a vizet és a szükséges tápanyagokat a talajból veszi fel, aminek állapota befolyásolja a növények gyökérzetének eloszlását és működését (ZHANG et al., 2009; SHARMA et al., 2014; LIU et al., 2015; 2016). Megjegyzendő azonban, hogy egy mezőgazdasági terület esetén a talajfelszín alatti kölcsönhatások komplexek, így a talajnedvesség mellett, a talaj szerkezete és tömörödése is befolyásolhatja a gyökéreloszlást.Agrotechnológia szempontjából a talajdegradáció egyik formája, a talajtömörödés a mezőgazdasági talajok sajátossága. AKINSUNMADE et al. (2019) kutatása a talajtömörödés vizsgálatát célozta meg. A talajtömörödés az intenzív gazdálkodással, a nehézgépek súlya révén alakul ki. A tömörödés a talajban a nagy hézagok redukálódását (makroporozitás-csökkenését), vagy eltűnését okozhatja, így a talaj hidraulikus vezetőképessége és ezáltal a nedvessége és az oldottanyag-tartalma is csökken. A folyamat gátolja az öntözővíz beszivárgását és a tápanyagfelvételt. A lefolyást és a talajeróziót fokozza, illetve korlátozza a gyökér fejlődését is (LOMBARDI et al., 2022).A GPR mérések sikeres mezőgazdasági alkalmazásának két fő követelménye a felszín alatti első méterig való behatolás képessége és a centiméteres felbontás. Ezért a mezőgazdasági vizsgálatokhoz használt GPR berendezések többsége 200–900 MHz közötti központi frekvenciatartományra kiélezett, ami száraz talajok esetén 3–14 cm, nedves talajok esetében pedig 8–18 cm vertikális felbontásnak felel meg (LOMBARDI et al., 2022).A növénytermesztés hozamának a talajtömörödés okozta veszteségei gyorsan kivizsgálhatók GPR segítségével. Ennek oka, hogy a talaj agrotechnikai tulajdonságainak változása szorosan összefügg a talajszerkezetben lévő víz térfogati hányadával. A talajtömörödöttség fokával változik a porozitás, a pórusméreteloszlás, ezáltal a víz térfogatarán', 'unique_identifier': 272}\n",

Microwave remote sensing with its unique characteristics of high penetration and sensitivity towards dielectric constant, has enabled the researchers to explore various techniques for soil moisture estimation. With the launch of Sentinel-1 (A&B) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites, the hindrance in accessing high spatial and temporal resolution data is eliminated. The current study focuses on surface soil moisture estimation for bare agricultural fields in the semi-arid region. Field soil moisture up to 5 cm depth using HydraGo Probe sensor and surface roughness synchronizing with satellite pass dates were collected from total 102 locations spanning four dates. Volumetric and sensor-based soil moisture are well correlated with R2 = 0.85. The Modified Dubois Model (MDM) was applied to obtain the relative permittivity of the soil for the backscattering coefficient (σ◦) for VV polarization, which is used as one of the inputs in universal Topp’s model for soil moisture calculation. Model derived soil moisture is well correlated with ground-based soil moisture for the entire range of the soil moisture (0.02-0.18 m3m-3) with R2 = 0.85 and RMSE=0.005. The entire soil moisture was categorized in three soil moisture ranges to evaluate the sensitivity. The highest correlation was observed for 0.06-0.1 m3m-3 with R2 = 0.73 and RMSE=0.003 followed by 0.015-0.6 m3m-3 with R2 = 0.81 and RMSE=0.001 and 0.11-0.18 m3m-3 with R2 = 0.48 and RMSE=0.019 which is significantly low. Performance accuracy of MDM is encouraging for bare soil moisture estimation for even the lower range of surface soil moisture.ReferencesBaghdadi, N., Choker, M., Zribi, M., El Hajj, M., Paloscia, S., Verhoest, N.

Key issues in this regard include how to deal with spatial variability and the adoption of deficit irrigation strategies at the field scale. A software application originally designed for water balance-based automated irrigation scheduling locally fine-tuned through the use of sensors has been further developed with the emerging paradigm of both digital twins and the Internet of Things (IoT). The aim of this research is to demonstrate the feasibility of automatically scheduling the irrigation of a commercial vineyard when adopting regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) strategies and assimilating in near real time the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) obtained from Sentinel-2 imagery. In addition, simulations of crop evapotranspiration obtained by the digital twin were compared with remote sensing estimates using surface energy balance models and Copernicus-based inputs. Results showed that regression between instantaneous fAPAR and in situ measurements of the fraction of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (fIPAR) had a coefficient of determination (R2) ranging from 0.61 to 0.91, and a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.10. The conversion of fAPAR to a daily time step was dependent on row orientation. A site-specific automated irrigation scheduling was successfully adopted and an adaptive response allowed spontaneous adjustments in order to stress vines to a certain level at specific growing stages. Simulations of the soil water balance components performed well. The regression between digital twin simulations and remote sensing-estimated actual (two-source energy balance Priestley–Taylor modeling approach, TSEB-PTS2+S3) and potential (Penman–Monteith approach) evapotranspiration showed RMSD values of 0.98 mm/day and 1.14 mm/day, respectively.Keywords: precision irrigation; digital twin; fAPAR; Sentinel; evapotranspiration1. IntroductionPresently, water is becoming scarce not only in arid and drought areas, but also in regions where rainfall used to be abundant. Although approximately 70% of freshwater resources is used for food production, less than 60% of all water used for irrigation is effectively used by crops [1]. One way to address this issue is to reduce inefficiencies in irrigation management. This requires modernization of irrigation, from river catchment to precise delivery and scheduling at the field level. Although it is true that there is a lot of scientific and technical knowledge about the best irrigation strategies to be adopted for each crop and time at the field level, putting them into practice is not a simple task. The main limitations are the availability of the tools and skills required that allow the quantification and monitoring of crop water requirements and water status in order to provide the right amount of water at the right time and place. In this context, precision irrigation, which is the application of the concept of precision agriculture to the field of irrigation, can contribute to the technological approach. Precision agriculture has been recently defined as “a management strategy that gathers, processes and analyses temporal, spatial and individual data and combines it with other information to support management decisions according to estimated variability for improved resource use efficiency, productivity, quality, profitability and sustainability of agricultural production” [2]. The latest technological developments in precision irrigation offer important opportunities to close the existing gap between water productivity and the profitability of an agricultural plot.Crop water requirements are usually calculated following the FAO-56 soil water balance (SWB) approach [3]. This approach is based on estimating maximum crop evapotranspiration (ETc), obtained by multiplying a reference evapotranspiration (ET0), calculated through the Penman–Monteith method, by a crop coefficient (Kc) that is characteristic for each crop and growth stage. However, particularly in woody crops, this approach can be quite uncertain as Kc may vary depending on factors such as row spacing and orientation, variety, crop load and canopy training system [4,5]. With respect to the latter of these factors, some studies have refined Kc in discontinuous canopies with indirect measurements of light interception [6,7,8]. Additionally, supplying the full water requirements is not always possible or desirable. For instance, regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) strategies have been successfully adopted to achieve higher water productivities [9,10,11] and/or fruit quality [12,13,14]. Crop water status can be monitored with sensors and used for irrigation scheduling [15,16,17]. Among the different sensors that are available, soil moisture capacitance sensors are probably the most widely used to trigger irrigation [18,19]. Although the simplest methodology is based on the switching on or off of valves when the signal of a soil moisture probe crosses some predefined threshold, commonly soil water content at field capacity and wilting point [20], particular consideration needs to be given to the high sensitivity of these sensors to differences in soil hydraulic properties and the heterogeneous distribution of soil water content, especially in drip irrigation systems. A combination of SWB and soil water content monitoring methods seems the best way to efficiently schedule irrigation [21]. This type of dual approaches are based on determining irrigation doses from a SWB model and feedback from sensors for the site-specific empirical adjustment of Kc [22,23]. The methodology proposed by Casadesús et al. [22] uses the trend of minimum soil moisture values between consecutive days to fine tune the water balance. IRRIX was a decision support system (DSS) designed for SWB-based automated irrigation scheduling locally tuned by sensors. Its feasibility was demonstrated in various crops such as Japanese plum [24], apple [23] or olive trees [21]. This manuscript introduces further improvements of IRRIX, described in Section 2.3, in which the assimilation of sensor data by a SWB model has been further developed with the emerging paradigms of digital twins and the Internet of Things (IoT). A digital twin is a virtual representation that serves as the real-time digital counterpart of a physical object or process [25]. The new automated irrigation system introduced in this study computes crop water requirements and closes the irrigation control loop autonomously, on a daily basis, importing data from soil/plant sensors, meteorology and remote sensing. Irrigation prescriptions are automatically sent to the irrigation controller installed in the field compliant with site-specific strategies. The digital twin behind the automated irrigation system also allows to simulate the different SWB components separately, so the end user can see in real time the amount of water used or the crop water status.One of the main limitations of only using soil and/or plant sensors to trigger irrigation is that this will be based on point measurements which sometimes are not representative of the heterogeneity of the entire irrigation sector. Satellite-based remote sensing technologies open up the possibility of providing spatio-temporal information of fields in near real time. In particular, the recent launch of the open access Sentinel-2 satellites (S2) makes it possible to monitor vegetative growth on a five-day turnaround, as long as there are no clouds [26]. Typically, remote sensing spectral vegetation indices, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), have been used to derive Kc values [27,28,29]. However, saturation issues of some of these indices at moderate-to-dense canopy levels and limitations of crops with clumped canopy structures have been widely reported [30,31]. Instead, estimations of biophysical parameters of the vegetation could be more effective for the monitoring of vegetative growth and therefore the estimation of potential evapotranspiration. In this regard, the remote sensing-derived fraction of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (fIPAR) or the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) have been estimated in different crops, mostly using empirical relationships with spectral vegetation indices [32,33,34,35]. However, this approach is site specific and sensitive to the canopy architecture, the row orientation, the optical properties of the canopy elements and the background [36]. Very few studies have aimed to derive fIPAR in heterogeneous canopies, such as row-structured canopies, using radiative transfer models [18,37,38]. The fAPAR can also be derived from the biophysical processor available in the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP), which built a neuronal network with the PROSAIL model and applied it to all S2 reflective bands [39]. fAPAR is often approximated by fIPAR because the vegetation pigments present a strong absorption in this spectral domain and the background reflectivities are usually small for well-developed canopies [40,41]. Therefore, S2 fAPAR time series could be a good alternative for assimilation into digital twins and to estimate potential evapotranspiration in all types of canopy structures.It is well known that other approaches have also been developed to directly retrieve crop water requirements based on remotely sensed surface energy balance (SEB) models [42,43,44]. Land surface temperature (LST) plays a critical role in the SEB. However, a trade-off exists between the spatial and temporal resolution of current thermal infrared sensors onboard satellites. While waiting for the launch of new satellites with sensors with a high spatial-temporal resolution in the thermal infrared domain, several approaches have been tested to downscale the coarse resolution of thermal infrared satellite imagery [45,46,47,48]. For instance, some studies have successfully downscaled LST to 20 m using a data mining sharpening (DMS) approach [48] with S2 and Sentinel-3 (S3) images [49]. The obtained LST, together with other Copernicus-based inputs, was used to estimate daily actual evapotranspiration (ETa) through the Priestley–Taylor version of the two-source energy balance (TSEB-PT) model [50,51,52,53]. These studies reported accuracies of instantaneous latent heat flux in woody crops ranging from 76 to 87 W/m2. It is probable that in the near future SEB modelling approaches with high-resolution LST will be operationally used to map crop water status in near real time and assimilated into digital twins such as the one proposed in this study. Therefore, studies that validate these approaches in different types of crops and water status are necessary to advance the state of the art and evaluate their pros and cons.One of the main challenges of automated irrigation DSS is to implement them in commercial fields. From our knowledge, no study has used a DSS to automatically schedule irrigation of a commercial vineyard through assimilating in near real time remote sensing estimates of fAPAR. Nor has it been used in commercial fields with the adoption of RDI strategies. Nor have digital twin-obtained SWB simulations been validated or compared against other methodologies. Therefore, the aim of this research is to demonstrate the feasibility of automatically scheduling the irrigation of a commercial vineyard by assimilating S2 fAPAR and adopting an RDI strategy. In particular, this study focuses on: (i) regressing S2 fAPAR with instantaneous fIPAR and upscaling it on a daily time scale using Oyarzun’s modelling approach [54] in rows with different orientations, (ii) the suitability of adopting an RDI strategy through an automated irrigation DSS, and (iii) a comparison of the evapotranspiration simulations obtained from a digital twin with those estimated with the TSEB-PTS2+S3 and Penman–Monteith (PM) models using Copernicus-based inputs.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Study SiteThis study was carried out during the growing seasons 2020 and 2021 in a 6.9 ha commercial vineyard (cv. Grenache) located in Aranyó (41°30′18″ N–0°50′09″ E, 316 m, Lleida, Spain) (Figure 1). The vineyard comprised three different irrigation sectors of 2.0, 2.3 and 2.6 ha (Figure 1b). Vines were planted in 2018 with a 110 Rister rootstock and at 1.0 × 2.0 m spacing distance. Two irrigation sectors (A and B) were oriented at 140 ° (NW-SE), while irrigation sector C was oriented at 100 ° (close to E-W). The canopy system was trained using vertical shoot positioning (VSP), with a bilateral, spur-pruner cordon located 0.7 m above the ground. Soil was left bare throughout the growing season. Irrigation was provided by means of a single pipe with drippers every 1 m, whose nominal flow was 2 L/h. Disease control and nutrition vine management were conducted by Family Torres winery following the organic wine grape production protocol of the ‘Costers del Segre’ Denomination of Origin (Catalonia, Spain). The area has a typical Mediterranean climate, with dry and hot summers and mild winters. Total annual rainfall in 2020 and 2021 was 475 and 288 mm, respectively. The annual reference evapotranspiration (ET0) for each year was 1071 and 1065 mm, respectively.Figure 1. Study site of the vineyard, showing in (a) a general overview of the location, in (b) the vineyard with the three irrigation sectors (A, B and C), in (c) averaged seasonal Sentinel-2 fAPAR of 2019 and in (d) a zonification map based on averaged 2019 fAPAR and location of representative points for sensor installation. WSC corresponds to the zone within irrigation sector C subjected to water stress cycles.In addition, an area of 0.2 ha within irrigation sector C was used to evaluate the soil water balance simulations obtained by the digital twin and to compare the simulated evapotranspiration and stem water potential with, respectively, the remote sensing estimations of evapotranspiration and stem water potential measurements (Figure 1b). In this area, water stress cycles (WSC) were conducted throughout both studied growing seasons. This area contained two pure pixels of 20 m. The WSC consisted of cutting irrigation for short periods of time, twice per campaign, until measured stem water potential (Ψstem) reached values below −1.2 MPa and then recovering vine water status again.During 2020, irrigation scheduling was conducted by the winegrower without using the cloud-based irrigation decision support system described in Section 2.3. In that year, data were only gathered and used for simulations and validations. During 2021, irrigation scheduling was carried out through the automated irrigation DSS. The DSS assimilated in near real time information of remotely sensed estimates of daily fiPAR and data from soil moisture sensors and weather stations in order to calculate vine water requirements.2.2. Selection of the Location for Installing SensorsSentinel-2 fAPAR time series were analyzed during the 2019 growing season [39]. A more detailed explanation of the approach used to estimate fAPAR with Sentinel-2 is explained later in the manuscript (Section 2.5). The averaged seasonal fAPAR of 2019 was used to classify different management zones within the vineyard based on vegetative growth (Figure 1c). Three different zones corresponding to different canopy vigor levels (Low, Medium and High) were identified using the k-means clustering tool (QGIS software, version Hannover 3.16) (Figure 1d). In each irrigation sector, a representative measuring point was selected taking into account the fAPAR classification map. The point was placed in the zone with the highest percentage within each irrigation sector. This representative point within each irrigation sector was visually selected to install the soil moisture sensors at different positions. For each point, soil properties were also analyzed and soil moisture release curves obtained by Hyprop 2 (METER Group, Pullman, WA, USA) (Table 1).Table 1. Soil properties sampled in the vineyard.Three soil moisture sensors (TEROS-10, METER Group, Pullman, WA, USA) were installed in each representative point at 0.3 m depth at three different positions: below the emitter, and at 0.25 m and 0.5 m from the emitter. An MTKD water meter (LabFerrer S.L., Cervera, Lleida, Spain) was also installed in each point to measure the amount of water applied and to monitor irrigation events. All sensors were connected to a ZL6 datalogger (METER Group, Pullman, WA, USA) via cables, and the data stored at a 15-min frequency at the ZENTRA cloud platform in near real time. Meteorological data were automatically gathered from the website of the Meteorological Service of Catalonia (SMC, www.ruralcat.net/web/guest/agrometeo.estacions) corresponding to a weather station (Les Borges Blanques) located 1.5 km from the vineyard.2.3. IrriDesk® and Definition of the Irrigation Seasonal PlanThe automated irrigation decision support system (DSS) used in this study, so called IrriDesk®, is open-access accessible for research purposes through a non-commercial version and also commercially available to any grower through an external company. IrriDesk® (www.irridesk.com) is a cloud-hosted platform developed under the paradigm of digital twin, which on a daily basis, sends updated prescriptions to irrigation controllers, following the integration of different data sources such as local sensors, meteorological and remote sensing data. IrriDesk® is an evolution of IRRIX, which has previously been used in several trials of sensor-based irrigation control [21,23,24]. In both cases, the underlying approach for irrigation scheduling is a site-specific soil water balance (SWB) fine-tuned by sensors [22]. In this approach, irrigation prescriptions for each management zone are calculated once a day, based on an SWB model, in mm/day, and are sent machine-to-machine to the irrigation controller after conversion to minutes of irrigation per irrigation event, considering the properties of the irrigation system and the programmed irrigation frequency.A relevant feature of IrriDesk® is that irrigation scheduling is guided by a seasonal plan, which allows the application of more elaborate strategies, such as supplemental irrigation and RDI for managing irrigation with limiting water allocations. The seasonal plan specifies, for each day, a range of acceptable accumulated irrigation since the start of the season until that day. Then, if the measured irrigation approaches the borders of that range (maximum and minimum), the irrigation prescriptions do not respond to sensors but are calculated to keep the accumulated irrigation within the range. The target soil moisture is also specified in the seasonal plan and can be set at different values along the season. Additionally, intended water unbalances can be specified at precise periods of the season in terms of the ratio between the irrigation to prescribe and the irrigation resulting from the SWB model.In the trials reported in this study, the seasonal plan was elaborated through SWB simulations, using as inputs the agronomical description of the crop, soil and irrigation setup, the historical weather at the site in the previous 10 years, the range of annual irrigation applied in previous years and the curve of intended water unbalance agreed between researchers and farmer. In the studied vineyard, the upper and lower applied water thresholds were, respectively, set at 150 and 230 mm (Figure 2c). Since the aim was to adopt an RDI strategy, water status levels were defined as a multiplier of irrigation needs or intended water deviations from the SWB (Figure 2a). For instance, in this study the multiplier was set to 0.6 during pre-veraison because the winegrower wanted to stress vines at this phenological stage. Immediately before veraison, the multiplier was set to 1.5 in order to recover vine water status. During post-veraison, it progressively decreased from 1.0 to 0.7. During post-harvest, water status was recovered again by defining a threshold of 1.0. Based on these values, the relative soil water content upper and lower limits were also adjusted throughout the growing season (Figure 2b). All these curves were predefined to determine admissible bounds for the irrigation scheduling and to ensure that irrigation inputs above those available for the campaign were not used.Figure 2. Definition of the seasonal plan parameters configured in the irrigation decision support system (DSS). The plan specifies: (a) intentional soil water balance deviation, multiplier of water needs; (b) thresholds defining the range of crop water comfort in terms of relative soil water content recorded by sensors (wilting point = 0, field capacity = 1); (c) range of cumulative irrigation thresholds, mm.At the beginning of the growing season, the DSS considered an expected seasonal curve of daily fIPARd based on the values measured the previous year. As the season progressed, new observed values were obtained from remote sensing. The new values of estimated fIPARd at the observation day were assimilated as the weighted average between observed and expected values, where the weights were set at 0.9 and 0.1, respectively. The expected values for the remaining part of the season were also modified. In general, the expected fIPARd values were re-scaled to fit the new value with the expected value. However, in early and late stages of the growing season, when fIPARd was expected to undergo rapid variations with either shooting or leaf fall, the time axis was modified to fit the new with the expected value.With the configuration set in these trials, the daily irrigation dose (did) (mm/day) were calculated as:did=  iwu∗ET0∗  fKx∗fIPARd+Ke  −effRain+SPcorrection(1)where iwu is the intended water unbalance specified in the seasonal plan, ET0 is the reference evapotranspiration measured the previous day at a nearby weather station (mm/day), fKx is an empirically adjusted coefficient from feedback by soil moisture sensors [22], fIPARd is the expected fIPARd for that day (%), obtained from S2 fAPAR and upscaled on a daily time step with Oyarzun’s model, Ke is the coefficient for soil evaporation [3] calculated by the model, effRain is the effective rain of the previous day (mm), obtained from pluviometer measurements and recalculated by the model, and SPcorrection is the required addition or subtraction of irrigation to keep the measurements within the range specified in the seasonal plan.In addition to scheduling irrigation, the digital twin behind IrriDesk® models the different variables of the soil water balance. The SWB model is based on the rationale of AquaCrop [55] plus specific adaptations to deal with discontinuous canopies and drip irrigation. For instance, it deals with daily fIPAR and soil water content is obtained by individually simulating nine compartments spatially distributed throughout the tree spacing (three blocks with three soil profile layers in depth). The simulated SWB variables were used to calculate the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) as one minus the ratio between actual and potential transpiration rate (1 − Ta/Tp) [56].2.4. Field MeasurementsΨstem was measured in each representative point throughout the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons every two weeks at noon with a pressure chamber (model 3005; Soil Moisture Equipment Corp. Santa Barbara, CA, USA) following the protocol described by McCutchan and Shackel [57]. Shaded leaves were wrapped in plastic bags covered with aluminum foil at least one hour before Ψstem measurements. All measurements were taken in less than one hour with three leaves at each point, one in each single vine.On the other hand, fIPAR was measured from 11:00 to 13:00 h (GMT+2) using a portable ceptometer (AccuPAR Linear PAR, Decagon Devices, Inc., Pullman, WA, USA) on the same dates as Ψstem. Incident PAR above and below vines was measured in five vines in a row per point. Measurements were conducted in horizontal position at ground level and perpendicular to vine row. In order to cover vine spacing, five equally spaced measurements were determined in an open space adjacent to each vine. Vine structural parameters such as height and canopy width perpendicular to the row were also measured on each occasion. These data were used to calculate fIPARd through the hourly Oyarzun model [54] and further used to validate remote sensing fAPAR. The canopy porosity parameter of Oyarzun’s model was adjusted so that the instantaneous measured value of fIPAR agreed with the simulated value.2.5. Satellite Imagery and Biophysical VariablesMultispectral instruments on Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B satellites provide high resolution multispectral shortwave observations of Earth’s surface with a geometric revisit time at the equator of 5 days [58]. S2 overpass through the study site was between 10:36 and 10:50 GTM. S2 images at level-2A were downloaded for the study site from Copernicus Open Access hub (https://scihub.copernicus.eu/ (last accessed on 15 November 2022)) using the Sentinelsat library (https://sentinelsat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ (last accessed on 15 November 2022)). Biophysical variables of the vegetation were estimated from the S2 biophysical processor [39] available in the SNAP software v8.0 (https://step.esa.int/main/download/snap-download/, last accessed on 11 December 2021). This processor relies on building a randomized dataset of vegetation biophysical variables from which reflectance simulations by the radiative transfer models (RTM) PROSPECT and SAIL are produced [59]. Therefore, instantaneous values of biophysical variables were obtained at the time of the satellite overpass for those days under clear sky conditions. In total, 23 and 22 S2 images were processed from April to October for 2020 and 2021, respectively. fAPAR was empirically regressed with both instantaneous and daily modeled fiPAR (fIPARd). Then, each time a S2 image was available, fAPAR of each irrigation sector was converted to fIPARd and assimilated into the digital twin to calculate grapevine water requirements (Equation (1)). In addition, the leaf area index (LAI) and the fractional vegetation cover (FVC) were used to derive actual evapotranspiration with the TSEB-PT model.2.6. Actual and Potential Evapotranspiration Using Copernicus-Based InputsSentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B images from the sea and land surface radiometer (SLSTR) were downloaded to obtain LST at 1 km resolution. In total, 99 and 111 cloud-free S3 images were processed in 2020 and 2021 for the same period mentioned for S2. The DMS approach [49] was used, combining S2 and S3 images to sharpen 1 km coarse spatial resolution LST from S3 to 20 m. The methodology used is described by Guzinski et al. [50]. Meteorological inputs were obtained from the European Center of Medium Weather Forecast (ECMWF) ERA5 reanalysis dataset [60]. This dataset has a 30 km grid and was used to run the TSEB-PT model. For the current study, the variables used were air temperature at 2 m, dew point temperature at 2 m, wind speed at 100 m, surface pressure and total column water vapor (TCWV). In addition, aerosol optical thickness (AOT) at 550 m was obtained from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) since it is not included in ERA5. Two ancillary sources of data were also used: land cover maps from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) (https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-land-cover?tab=overview, last accessed on 10 October 2021) and the digital elevation model (DEM) of the shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM). In the study site, the C3S landcover map, produced at 300 m resolution, did not vary from one year to another, and so the one from 2017 was used for both years. A look-up table of different parameters associated to each crop class was set up in accordance with Guzinski et al. [50].The TSEB-PT modeling approach [61] estimates the energy fluxes of both soil and canopy, separately based on a single bulk LST measurement that initially assumes a maximum potential rate of transpiration. This first guess, which usually starts with an alpha coefficient of 1.26, is sequentially reduced until realistic fluxes are obtained [62]. This model has been used to derive land-surface energy fluxes using Copernicus-based inputs (TSEB-PTS2+S3) [50,51,52,53]. Further details on the TSEB model scheme can be found at the source code (https://github.com/hectornieto/pyTSEB., last accessed on 22 April 2022) and the original formulation of the model [42].On the other hand, potential evapotranspiration (ETp), defined as the water usage (or evapotranspiration rate) of a well-watered crop was computed from the Penman–Monteith model, assuming a maximum stomatal conductance [63,64]. ETp was therefore computed using S2 LAI estimations and the same meteorological inputs as in the TSEB-PTS2+S3. For both cases, instantaneous energy fluxes at the satellite overpass were upscaled to daily water fluxes, expressed in units of mm/day, by multiplying the instantaneous ratio of latent heat fluxes over solar irradiance by the average daily solar irradiance [65]. Gap filling was applied following the protocol described by Jofre-Cekalović et al. [53]. Both TSEB-PTS2+S3 and the Penman–Monteith estimated ET were intercompared with that modelled through the digital twin by computing their correlation as well as their root mean square deviation (RMSD=∑(xi−yi)2N). The RMSD is analogous to the root mean square error (RMSE), but denotes deviations between two independent estimates (x and y) rather than the error from one estimate to a reference measurement.3. Results and Discussion3.1. Sentinel-2 fAPARS2 fAPAR was compared with fIPAR under the hypothesis that for green canopies the latter is a good proxy of fAPAR. This assumption is valid mostly during the non-senescence periods of the growing season due to the strong absorption capacity in this spectral domain of the photosynthetic pigments [66] and the usually small background reflectivities for well-developed canopies [40,41,67]. A comparison of instantaneous S2 fAPAR with in situ measurements of fIPAR at the same time as the satellite overpassed showed an R2 of 0.61 and 0.91 for irrigation sectors with 140° and 100° row orientation, respectively (Figure 3a). These coefficients of determination are quite promising and suggest the suitability of using S2 fAPAR in discontinuous canopies, particularly in conditions without cover crop in the interrow. On the other hand, the existence of cover crop in the interrow could be a problem when estimating the biophysical parameters of the canopy, especially with the spatial resolutions provided by the current open-source satellites. The RMSD, which ranged from 0.09 to 0.10 indicated that this relationship did not significantly vary between row orientations. This deviation, however, may be explained by soil background reflectance and diffuse illumination variations due to multiscattering or also due to the poor representativeness of five vines within a 20 m pixel.

More accurate water status recovery in crops is required for precise irrigation through remote sensing technologies. These technologies have a lot of potential in intelligent irrigation because they allow for real-time environmental data collection. Nowadays, digital practices have been used, such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which plays an essential role in various applications related to crop management. Drones offer an exciting opportunity to track crop fields with high spatial and temporal resolution remote sensing to enhance water stress management in irrigation. Farmers have historically depended on soil moisture measurements and weather conditions to detect crop water status for irrigation scheduling. This review paper summarizes the use of UAV remote sensing data in crops for estimating the water status and gives a detailed summary of the potential capacity of UAV remote sensing for water stress application. The remote sensing techniques help modify agricultural practices to meet this significant challenge by providing repeated information on crop status at different scales and various performances during the season. UAVs successful implementation in water stress estimations depends on UAV features, such as flexibility of use in flight planning, low cost, reliability, autonomy, and capability of timely provision of high-resolution data. UAV with a thermal sensor is considered the most effective technique for detecting water stress using specific indices. Thermal imaging can identify water status variations and crop water stress index (CWSI). This CWSI acquired through UAV thermal sensors imagery can be acceptable for managing real-time irrigation to achieve optimum crop water efficiency.\\n\\nSimilar content being viewed by others\\nPrecision Agriculture and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)\\nChapter © 2020\\nImproving the precision of irrigation in a pistachio farm using an unmanned airborne thermal system\\nArticle 24 September 2014\\nV.

Water scarcity is a critical factor that limits agricultural production. In general terms, much of the world water supplies are used by agriculture (Karakoçak et al. 2013). Over the last few decades, land and water management for agriculture has met rapidly rising demands. However, a lack of available water for sustainable crop production is a growing concern in the semi-arid region (Loka et al. 2011). Due to climate change and water shortage, water application in sustainable farming has become a significant problem in all developed countries, so effective water management strategies are the perfect solution. Precision agriculture (PA) generally seeks to improve the quantity and quality of agricultural production with different resources (e.g., fertilizer, energy, water, herbicides, and pesticides). Throughout the world, civilization is formulating a growing population that will hit 10 billion in 2050 (United Nations, 2017). China agricultural water use is still in a state of low efficiency and severe waste, which seriously restricts China economic development. China is a vast country with a severe shortage of water. Mainly, agriculture (e.g., the arable land in the north part of China) takes 62.06% of fresh water (Becker 2015).\\n\\nDrought is widely recognized as the world most expensive and imminent natural disaster, resulting in substantial economic, ecological, and environmental losses (Nicholson et al. 1998; Mishra and Singh 2010). Since the late 1990s, central and eastern region of china has several severe droughts (Fig. 1). Unfortunately, the current irrigation efficiency in China is only about 52%, which is well below advanced countries, achieving an efficiency of about 70–80% of water usage. It is therefore essential to control irrigation with optimum water use. Worldwide, farmers face various difficulties, especially in semi-arid areas of agricultural water supplies (Gonzalez-Dugo et al. 2010; Jin et al. 2018). Global food production has projected to increase by 70% over the upcoming years to keep up with this development (Thornton et al. 2018; Sonnino et al. 2019; Amorim 2019).\\n\\nFig. 1\\nfigure 1\\nDrought condition in China eastern and central regions; a wheat, b rice (He et al. 2011)\\n\\nFull size image\\nAgriculture is under water stress\\nAgricultural water use is the primary variable for increased water scarcity, and irrigation accounts for about 70% of the world’s freshwater extractions (Tshwene and Oladele 2016). Crop water productivity (CWP) correlates with the water and crop production used for agricultural production. Monitoring crops at different development stages is essential for several applications, such as water stress, decisions on crop inputs (fertilizers, water, and pesticides), and modeling of crop yields (Sakamoto et al. 2005). With China rapid development, agricultural water resources are becoming more and more critical. Intelligent irrigation is characterized to increased yield, water scarcity, and low agricultural practice results. Climate change on plant transpiration and soil water balance substantially impact crops quality and productivity under limited water resources (Sakamoto et al. 2005). The latest earth observation technologies (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles) make it possible to monitor plant health (e.g., canopy temperature) in real time.\\n\\nWith the growth of the Internet of Things, a wide variety of data and knowledge about the world is becoming readily available (Awais et al. 2021). In addition, there is also substantial improvement in the production of irrigation machines that conserve water (Li et al. 2020). Timely and effective irrigation decision making and the application of irrigation will increase the quality of water use. Imageries from satellites were previously occupied, processed, and analyzed for getting water status. This review reflects the modern remote sensing experience acquired from UAV-based technology to achieve sustainable development and the potential ability to evaluate crop water stress induces and plant physiological parameters.\\n\\nPrecision farming and remote sensing\\nPrecision agriculture (PA) aims to optimize and expand agricultural processes to certify final production and involves fast, consistent, and circulated measurements to farmers aware and gives a supplementary overview of their current situation in the cultivated land (Kacira et al. 2005; Körner and Straten 2008). The technology frequently used includes integrated electronic communication, wireless sensor network, precision positioning systems, machine learning methodology, variable rate technology, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAVs), and geographic information systems for well-timed crop management (Liaghat and Balasundram 2010). The PA cycle is shown in (Fig. 2). The different specific remote sensing applications are (e.g., yield prediction, irrigation, weed detection, and precision farming) on the primary platform of remote sensing (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles—UAV, satellite, and sensors). These techniques working process requires a vast knowledge of the fertilizer map, quality of soil, nutrients, and weeds (Moran et al. 1997). Many farmers used nutrient requirement data and compared them with spatial variations of the playing area (Robertson et al. 2007). These alterations must be pushed the farmers to move from conservative farming (Vellidis et al. 2008) to precision agriculture farming.\\n\\nFig. 2\\nfigure 2\\nThe precision agriculture cycle (Berni et al. 2009a)\\n\\nFull size image\\nThe primary importance of precision agriculture is management collection and data utilization to make an automatic decision (Pham and Stack 2018). PA is expanding this change and is the primarily driven force for big data analytics (Wolfert et al. 2017; Poppe et al. 2015). Precision farming includes special features of remote sensing that are not present in traditional platforms, such as satellites and airborne platforms. The different specific applications of precision agriculture are (e.g., yield prediction, irrigation, weed detection, and precision farming) on the primary platform of remote sensing (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles—UAV, satellite, and sensors). The working process of these techniques requires a vast knowledge of the map of fertilizer, quality of soil, nutrients, and weeds (Moran et al. 1997). Many farmers used nutrient requirement data and compared them with spatial variations of the playing area (Robertson et al. 2007). These alterations must be pushed the farmers to move from conservative farming to precision agriculture farming (Vellidis et al. 2008). The primary importance of precision agriculture is the management collection and data utilization to make an automatic decision (Pham and Stack 2018). PA is expanding this change and is the primarily driven force for big data analytics (Wolfert et al. 2017; Poppe et al. 2015). UAVs capture aerial photographs of agricultural fields in precision agriculture applications to track crop health, estimate nutrient status, estimate yield, and calculate crop water demand. Five essential points that need to be addressed by the research community depend on increasing the adoption of precision farming among farmers.\\n\\nIdentify the management problems that producers regularly face, including agricultural, environmental, or economic challenges.\\n\\nImprove the processing of data from automated photogrammetric applications to calibration of instruments and image enhancement.\\n\\nDevelop algorithms in the processed data that can extract and interpret the information.\\n\\nAdopt high spatial resolution and cost-effective platforms that can collect data to resolve the problems found.\\n\\nCommunicate these results by developing decision-making mechanisms that can support the best management practices for operations into a better informed management decision.\\n\\nFundamental principle of thermal remote sensing\\nIn precision agriculture and smart farming, remote sensing is widely regarded as one of the most significant technologies. In the last 35 years, it has been widely used for tracking cultivated fields and providing successful precision agriculture solutions (Mulla 2013). Many crops and vegetation parameters can be monitored using remote sensing images at different wavelengths. RS techniques used to track vegetation status at various growth stages using satellite imagery or images captured by manned aircraft (Mora et al. 2017). There are two significant characteristics to define electromagnetic radiation, frequency, and wavelength. These data are transformed into temperatures (Khanal et al. 2017). Inside the IR zone (0.7–100 μm), two classes are distinguished, which are reflected—IRR (0.7–3.0 μm) and TIR (3.0–100 μm). Typically, the surface objects, such as trees, water, soil, and humans, emit TIR radiation within the range of (3.0–14.3 μm) of the EM spectrum (Jensen 2009). Part of the IR energy is transmitted to the earth’s surface within the range of the EM spectrum, ranging from 3 to 5 μm and 8 to 14 μm (Vinet and Zhedanov 2011). Atmospheric gases (i.e., ozone, carbon dioxide, and water) absorb almost all radiations between 5 and 8 μm, as shown in (Fig. 3) (Jensen 2009).\\n\\nFig. 3\\nfigure 3\\nThermal region of atmospheric transmittance with standard gaseous and water-induced absorption bands (Richter and Schläpfer 2019)\\n\\nFull size image\\nStefan–Boltzmann, Kirchhoff’s, Wien, and Planck’s physical law better understand EM behavior. According to the physical law of Plank’s, frequency (f) is proportional to its energy factor (Q), while h is the constant that can be used to alter this equation.\\n\\n(1)\\nEquation (2.1) can be rewritten as follows after assuming that the wave frequency (f) is inversely proportional to its length (λ) and proportional to the speed of light (c).\\n\\n(2)\\nOn the other hand, the wavelength is inversely proportional to its quantum energy. Therefore, less energy has a greater wavelength. The laws of Wien and Boltzmann define the relationship of black body radiations. Wien’s displacement law describes the relationship between a black body’s actual temperature in Kelvin degrees and its maximum spectral wavelength. The overall output changes into shorter wavelengths as the temperature increases (Kuenzer and Dech 2013).\\n\\n(3)\\nRemote sensing in agriculture\\nRemote sensing is the technique of material and object inferences from measurements made at a distance to the objects under analysis without physical contact. Remote sensing systems for PA and agriculture, in general, can be divided into two categories: (i) sensor platform and (ii) sensor type. Satellites, aerial platforms, and ground-based platforms are popular places for installing sensors (Fig. 4). Although the conventional techniques for acquiring weather and crop growth status are effective, they involve manual scouting, intensive, and time-consuming labor (Latif et al. 2018). It is also impossible to follow traditional approaches under adverse climate-changing conditions. Geospatial technology is, i.e., under certain conditions. Remote sensing and GIS are helpful for broad spatial and temporal data collection and tracking (Shanmugapriya et al. 2019). RS technology can potentially revitalize the study of contributing factors to agricultural productivity based on crops and soils (Liaghat and Balasundram 2010; Hussain 2019). Remotely sensed satellite data are used to identify stress crops’ early-stage identification and any disruptions for crop-specific yield estimation (Bernardes, et al. 2011; Gu, et al. 2007). With the advent of technologies generally referred to as drones, such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), agricultural problems such as plant disease or pest control can now be solved by sprinkling pesticides, fertilizer, and water on them.\\n\\nFig. 4\\nfigure 4\\nA typical layout for the remote, UAV, and ground sensing systems deployed for precision agriculture\\n\\nFull size image\\nSatellite systems remote sensing\\nRemote sensing techniques are used to collect data through different satellites. The satellite RS systems started with the Landsat-1 launch in 1972 (Belward and Skøien 2015; Markham and Helder 2012). The eventual launching of SPOT-1 in 1986 and Ikonos in 1999 introduced the era of commercial satellite systems, resulting in rapidly increasing image efficiency, including high spatial resolution (Toth and Jóźków 2016). Different airborne sensors and satellite used for digital application are given in (Table 1).\\n\\nTable 1 Satellite and airborne thermal sensors attached to platforms\\nFull size table\\nNumerous studies (Hatfield and Prueger 2010; Jordan 1969) (Huete et al. 2002) on agriculture sector monitored the condition of crops. Some vegetation indices (VIs) were established, depending on the grouping of waveband, to measure the various plant parameters, e.g., biomass, residue cover, leaf area, leaf chlorophyll, and ground cover, while these VIs provide symptoms of vegetable conditions. The earth observation satellite system, such as sentinel-1, Landsat, GeoEye, and Spot, has been used to study crops water status (Table 2). Most images of satellite-based remote sensing are used for biomass estimation (Yang et al. 2000) and prediction of crop output (Doraiswamy et al. 2003) with the help of (NDVI).\\n\\nTable 2 Types of satellite systems used to estimate the water status\\nFull size table\\nUAV-based remote sensing\\nA series of studies have been performed using UAV technology. The most examined crops were olive (Berni et al. 2009b; Agam et al. 2013; Poblete-Echeverría, et al. 1112), citrus (Gonzalez-Dugo et al. 2014; Stagakis et al. 2012), almond (García-Tejero, et al. 2018; Zhao et al. 2017; Zhao et al. 2017), vineyards (Bellvert et al. 2016a; Baluja et al. 2012; Matese et al. 2018), and peach (Bellvert et al. 2016b; Park et al. 2017). The most commonly used UAV in agricultural water status studies is shown in (Fig. 5). Agricultural application of agro-chemicals is required for particular circumstances, such as location, site-specific management, and a particular time. These applications are completed with ground sprayers, which is not an accurate application of agro-chemicals. An indigenous UAV for the spraying of pesticides for standardized and site-specific applications of pesticides is therefore necessary. Also, the picture obtained from UAV will help the present state of crop, irrigation management and be a potential application for detecting diseases and pest attacks. Therefore, UAV secured prime importance to obtain a picture at the right time.\\n\\nFig. 5\\nfigure 5\\nTypes of (UAVs) used for evaluating water stress in the agricultural field. Note: a quadcopter attached with RGB thermal sensors (Santesteban et al. 2017), b fixed-wing eBee agriculture drone equipped with the multi-spectral and thermal camera, c DJI (S900) multi-rotor UAV drone, fitted with RGB, and thermal cameras (Zenmuse XT, FLIR System, Inc., USA), d hexacopter fitted out with RGB, thermal, and multi-spectral sensors\\n\\nFull size image\\nTypes of remote sensor used in UAV\\nImages from the drone platform were used for vegetation mapping in the visible and IR spectrum. These sensors can be utilized to calculate water stress, LAI, growth stages, biomass, and crop healthiness. Different other parameters, such as the farm survey, insect identification, and mapping, are also accomplished using various sensors. The list of sensors attached to the UAVs drone for sensing cameras is shown below.\\n\\nRGB camera\\nAn RGB camera usually contains a digital and conventional uniform sensor. RBG cameras use spectral bandwidth of red, green, and blue spectral circles to collect energy from the visible EMS. The RGB camera lens depends on image sharpness, while the camera’s spatial resolution regulates its decision within an image (Fig. 6a). The pictures extract the dimensional properties of the crop, such as height, size, and parameter (Johansen et al. 2018; Mu et al. 2018; Tu et al. 2019). In general, water resources for the more abundant crop are expected to be available quickly, resulting in a shortage of agricultural crop water. The production structure, such as width, height, spacing, missing plant, and ground cover fraction, is remotely identified (Castro et al. 2018; Weiss and Baret 2017).\\n\\nFig. 6\\nfigure 6\\nModels of sensors used on UAV platforms for thermography in crops. Note: a a multi-sensors setup with an RGB, multi-spectral, and a thermal camera (Santesteban et al. 2017). b Multi-spectral sensor (Tetracam.Mini-MCA-6, Inc., Chatsworth, USA) (Turner et al. 2011). c Hyperspectral camera (Headwall. Photonics, MA, USA). d Thermal sensors (FLIR System, Inc., USA) (Zarco-Tejada et al. 2012)\\n\\nFull size image\\nMulti-spectral camera\\nThe multi-spectral sensor has various bands in the electromagnetic spectrum. The multi-spectral camera contains 4–6 groups with about 10–15 nm bandwidth in the electromagnetic spectrum region blue, green, red, red edge, and NIR. The multi-spectral sensor Parrot Sequoia revolutionizes the agricultural sector and provides a reliable, adaptable solution compatible with all types of drones. Their geographic resolution is acceptable for RS applications, allowing the spectral response to be observed at the canopy level. For this purpose, multi-spectral sensors are frequently used in RS agricultural applications with reasonably low costs (Fig. 6b). The multi-spectral sensor detects the plants' light and absorbs in four different parts: green and red lights and two bands of infrared invisible to the human eye (Berni et al. 2009a). Some necessary specifications of the multi-spectral sensor are given (Table 3).\\n\\nTable 3 Some important specifications of sensor parrot sequoia\\nFull size table\\nThe spatial resolution of multi-spectral sensors is adequate in agricultural RS applications, enabling the spectral response at the canopy level. When the vegetation starts in stress condition, its refractive is decreased at the NIR band, while the reflectance of the plant is increased at the red band. Due to this intention, NDVI has shown a strong relationship with chlorophyll content, crop water stress index (CWSI), leaf area index (LAI), yield, and vigor (Matese et al. 2018; Espinoza et al. 2017; Poblete et al. 2017; Jorge et al. 2019).\\n\\nHyperspectral\\nAirborne hyperspectral imagery delivered detailed information of the spectral reflection of the earth’s surface and can be used for RS applications. e.g., mineral mapping, land cover assets, and the coastal environment (Im and Jensen 2008; Ghiyamat and Shafri 2010; Govender et al. 2007). Such sensors can acquire images from a visible to IR region of EMs in many narrow bands (Fig. 6c). A hyperspectral sensor formed three-dimensional data called a cube of hyperspectral information. These hyperspectral cube images contain pixels of spatial information entire spectral reflectance curve (Aasen et al. 2018). In precision farming applications, specific biotic and abiotic stresses are monitored due to the high resolution of hyperspectral data (Rodríguez-Pérez et al. 2007). Another research suggested that hyperspectral data were used to identify the water stress in the citrus orchard using the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and fluorescence measurements (Zarco-Tejada et al. 2012). However, high-resolution images from the hyperspectral sensor were further used to establish the canopy map between CWSI and (gs) in olive orchards with different irrigation managements (Berni et al. 2009b; Gerhards et al. 2019). The specification of images taken from hyperspectral sensors is shown in Table 4.\\n\\nTable 4 Specification of hyperspectral imaging through UAVs\\nFull size table\\nThermal\\nIn the 1960s, the use of thermal data to detect water stress at field scale with thermal remote sensing became prominent (Tanner 1963). The thermal sensor uses thermal radiation to read passive thermal rendition with a wavelength range of 7–12 µm (Fig. 6d). An array of microbolometers inside the sensors is being used to store and received the thermal rendition signal and stored these signals as raw data number (DN) values on the image pixel. On the other hand, a thermal sensor monitored the surface temperature (Anderson et al. 2013; Stark et al. 2014). Thermal RS is a mechanism by which the heat released from an object is measured and transformed into temperature readings without contact with a body (Khanal et al. 2017). A comprehensive list of commercial thermal cameras on UAV platforms for RS application in precision agriculture was found in the literature (Khanal et al. 2017; Alvino and Marino 2017; Sepulcre-Cantó et al. 2006).\\n\\nApplication of thermal imaging\\nThermal imaging as a plant stress monitoring tool\\nApplying thermal input to classify plant water stress with thermal sensors became common in the 1960s (Tanner 1963). The thermal sensor uses thermal radiation to read passive thermal rendition with a spectral range of 7–12 µm. An array of microbolometers inside the thermal sensors was used to identify and receive the thermal rendition signal and store these signals as raw data number (DN) values on the image pixel. Padhi et al. (2012) stated that various irrigation treatments could use thermal imaging to differentiate soil water deficits in cotton fields. The proposed thermal imaging can be used in cotton fields to assess the soil water deficit (Padhi et al. 2012). Pou et al. (2014) conducted a study on grape vines to examine the potential of using thermal imaging to evaluate the plant water stress (Pou et al. 2014). Grant et al. (2007) have used thermal imaging to diagnose the stress responses in grapevine under various irrigation regimes. They noticed that thermal imaging should differentiate between irrigated and non-irrigated plant canopies and noticed a disparity between plants and treatments for deficit irrigation (Grant et al. 2007). Jones et al. (2002) investigate thermal imaginations to evaluate the stomatal closure at the field level. They stated that by using infrared thermography, the water relationship of grapevine canopies could be studied. The inclusion of non-leaf material in the analysis of the images must be avoided to make this methodology more precise. It is possible to avoid non-leaf material by selecting suitable areas in the canopy plots or using dry and wet temperature thresholds to define the range outside which temperature values are rejected. They further stressed the potential benefits of thermal imaging. Thermography enables the semi-automated analysis of large canopy areas to study plant stomatal behavior with much more efficient replication than those achieved by porometry (Table 5).\\n\\nTable 5 Commonly used sensors on UAV platform\\nFull size table\\nDevelopment of data processing system\\nThermal imaging and image processing often allow automatic image correction, such as removing pixels representing the sky or soil. In addition, because of the potentially high accuracy in image comparisons, they concluded that thermal imaging has the potential to obtain measurements that are best suited for comparative studies (Jones et al. 2002). It should be noticed that remote sensing can observe plants’ reactions to water stress rather than the stress itself. Unfortunately, related plant responses can give rise to several different environmental stresses. For example, water stress, mineral deficiency, disease, and insect damage contribute to stomatal closing, and many stresses appear to decrease the leaf area. Therefore, the effect of water tension from just one recorded reaction is difficult to track. Fortunately, remote sensing techniques from previous literature are offered to identify distinct stress responses (Jones and Vaughan 2010). Therefore, it is easier to combine multiple ways of prejudice against water tension attributable to other factors. Over the past few years, research on the estimation of water stress in various crops has been investigated, and RS imagery has increased. First of all, the research adopting both VIS and TIR imagery has been attempted to estimate crop water stress (Möller et al. 2006; Leinonen and Jones 2004). The co-registration method of VIS and TIR images has been widely accepted to calculate pure crop temperature, excluding soil temperature. This makes it possible to differentiate the canopy cover area and the soil surface in the VIs image and then compute the canopy cover in the TIR image co-registered with the VIS image. Despite the versatility of two kinds of image data combined, co-registration instead involves time-consuming work. A histogram-based approach has been implemented to eliminate the CT from soil background temperature using TIR imagery (Park et al. 2017). The method combines the TIR image pixel histogram and uses a constant threshold to obtain canopy-related temperatures (e.g., the coldest 33% of the histogram).\\n\\nThe threshold in the histogram describes the border between vegetation and soil distribution, and mathematical and analytical methods calculate the value. The study shows that the CWSI estimation process has been facilitated and optimized, removing the need for VIs image processing. However, based on site-specific crop types, proper determination of threshold values to discard non-canopy pixels in histogram analysis is needed. The mixed pixels of thermal imagery will cause significant bias in canopy temperature at midday, as they are included in the canopy pixel clusters. As an indicator of crop water stress, the determination of Twet and Tdry for CWSI has a significant effect on the accuracy of CWSI values. The thermal sensor uses thermal radiation to read passive thermal rendition with a spectral range of 7–12 µm. An array of microbolometers inside the thermal sensors was used to identify and receive the thermal rendition signal and store these signals as raw data number (DN) values on the image pixel. The thermal camera and UAVs allow data collection to be more versatile and lower cost than conventional remote sensing methods. Figure 7 shows the example of picture processing for irrigation management. In UAV-based CWSI analysis, an attempt was made to find an optimal UAV flight time, showing that midday UAV sensing promises optimal data collection, minimizing shadow effects on the earth (Quebrajo et al. 2018; Bellvert et al. 2014). These UAV-based techniques would be a promising method with optimized technologies to detect plant water status, integrating sophisticated image analytic algorithms and upgraded camera systems (Gago et al. 2015; García-Tejero et al. 2018).\\n\\nFig. 7\\nfigure 7\\nData processing flowchart\\n\\nFull size image\\nTime for taking thermal images\\nVarious guidelines can be used for genotype selection and stress monitoring processes on how and when to measure canopy temperature (Pinter et al. 1990). The first model hypothesizes that temperature readings should be done, while there is less water content in the soil. The explanation is that if the plants can transpire at a higher rate under low soil moisture levels, they will sustain comparatively higher growth and yield (Gardner et al. 1981). The second hypothesis is that, in well-watered settings, temperature readings should be done. The explanation for this is that since plants under this situation have higher temperatures, they transpire less and conserve water in the soil profile that can be used later during the reproductive process and have greater yields. It is essential to determine the optimum time of taking thermal images considering the stage of the crop, time of day, and weather conditions. In most of the studies, canopy temperature was measured around midday. Zia et al. (2012) took hourly thermal images to study the impact of the time of day on image acquisition and found that midday can be the most suitable time to take thermal measurements due to the highest canopy temperature and lowest stomatal conductance during solar noon and said that this would help to find the most significant difference between the treatments (Zia et al. 2012). Zia et al. (2012) analyzed the canopy temperature measurements taken during the day and found that the optimal time for calculating canopy temperature is 11:00–13:00 and 16:00 h (Zia et al. 2012). About growth point, time of day, and atmosphere, attempted to establish optimum measurement times for canopy temperature. They find that about 09:00 in the morning and 13:00 was the perfect time to measure the canopy’s temperature (Balota et al. 2007). A weak relationship between the depression of canopy temperature (CTD) and other parameters was also noted when the measurements were taken during low solar radiance with high wind speed and rain events.\\n\\nAerial images acquisition and software solutions\\nThe soil properties and vegetation indices can be measured using various airborne sensors through remote sensing techniques. Such as LAI and NDVI are the two most common indices to identify crop health. Also, the thermal sensor is used to calculate water stress from horticulture crops (Berni et al. 2009a). The canopy reflectance is used to classify the biochemical and biophysical properties with different methods, such as machine learning methodology, which shows superior outcomes in many studies.

To tackle this challenge, modern agricultural systems are relying on new technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT) to improve agricultural productivity and resource use efficiency. Although IoT has gained considerable attention in the last few years, the key concepts of IoT and their applicability across different domains of agriculture are still new to many researchers, practitioners, managers, and policymakers. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the use of different IoT platforms, wireless sensor networks, and other associated technologies like remote sensing, cloud computing, and big data analytics in digital agriculture. The review also explores the use of communication technologies, microcontrollers, and machine learning in smart irrigation and decision support systems. The necessity of interoperability (data transfer and communication without human interference) among devices is discussed in detail with regard to facilitating and exchanging agricultural data more effectively. The discussion also includes opportunities and challenges in standardizing IoT; developing energy-efficient and affordable technologies; and improving data collection, transfer, storage, processing, security, anonymity, and privacy.

For example, global food production needs to be increased by about 70% to ensure food security for an estimated world population of more than 9.7 billion people in 2050 (Cole et al., 2018; FAO, 2017). Further, climate change is projected to affect global food production and efforts to increase food productivity. Notably, crop production across the globe has already experienced negative effects from warming temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, and increased extreme weather events (IPCC, 2022; Paudel et al., 2014). This will likely be exacerbated by climate change in the future (Hasegawa et al., 2021; Lobell et al., 2008; Rosenzweig & Parry, 1994). As such, researchers, scientists, policymakers, and organizations like the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) call for a radical transformation in global agricultural and food systems. Therefore, improved technologies that aim at enhancing production and supply-chain efficiencies under a resource-constrained environment are crucial to ensuring food security in the face of climate change (FAO, 2017). One such technology is the Internet of Things (IoT), which has recently shown the potential to provide solutions to several challenges associated with increased agricultural productivity under climatic changes and variability (Figure 1).\\n\\nDetails are in the caption following the image\\nFIGURE 1\\nOpen in figure viewer\\nUses of the Internet of Things (IoT) in agriculture (Source: Salam, 2022, used with permission).\\nAlthough there is no single definition of IoT, it could be broadly described as a system of devices, software programs, sensors, and other technologies that are either connected or are able to become connected via the Internet to exchange information and data (Borgia, 2014). The first application of IoT is believed to be an information-sharing network used by US defense sectors in 1969, then called the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network. The chronological timeline detailing the evolution process of various technologies within IoT since 1969 is summarized in Table 1 (Balas et al., 2019). In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in the number of common devices that might be considered to be a part of the IoT framework, including cell phones, televisions, thermostats, vehicles, refrigerators, home lighting systems, and smart watches among many others. Such IoT infrastructure is projected to substantially impact the global economy, with more than 100 billion connections (Huawei Technologies Co., 2015) and a financial impact of more than $11 trillion by 2025 (Manyika et al., 2015). Their impact is largely apparent in the agricultural sector, which currently contributes up to 60% of the national gross domestic product in many countries (The World Bank, 2019).\\n\\nTABLE 1.

Specifically, IoT use in precision and smart agriculture is notable with applications in data-informed, site-specific, and real-time management and decision-making. International Society of Precision Agriculture defines precision agriculture as “a management strategy that gathers, processes and analyzes temporal, spatial and individual data and combines it with other information to support management decisions according to estimated variability for improved resource use efficiency, productivity, quality, profitability and sustainability of agricultural production.” Smart agriculture refers to farming using softwares, sensors, automation, and data technologies. Digital agriculture seeks to utilize data from precision farming and the power of Artificial Intelligence. Digital agricultural technologies and the use of IoT are illustrated in Figure 1. Development of pilot research farms is already underway in several countries to determine the feasibility of IoT-informed decision-making for improving the efficiency and sustainability of agricultural production. Some examples include the Accelerating Precision Agriculture to Decision Agriculture (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang et al., 2017) and SmartAgriHubs (Chatzikostas et al., 2019) and SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos et al., 2012) in Europe. Yet, the adaptation of IoT technology in the agricultural sector is still in its infancy (Villa-Henriksen et al., 2020).\\n\\nIoT enables us to gather information from enclosed proximity to the physical location using fog computing, edge computing, communication protocols, and sensor technologies. They show potential in improving decision-making and productivity in various stages of agricultural production. Examples include the use of wireless in-field sensors in improving the measurement of soil moisture and permittivity (Salam, 2020; Bogena et al., 2010), autonomous precision irrigation systems (Dong et al., 2013), and identification and tracking of livestock animals (Trotter et al., 2010). Satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and new remote sensing approaches (e.g., PlanetLab) are increasingly used in IoT. For example, UAVs have been used for plant height estimation (Anthony et al., 2014; Herwitz et al., 2004), biomass estimation (Sinha et al., 2015), crop yield prediction (Ashapure et al., 2020; Panday et al., 2020), detection of weeds (De Castro et al., 2017), soil nitrogen management (Ballester et al., 2017), crop disease detection (Sugiura et al., 2016), and estimation of the leaf area index (LAI) (Hunt et al., 2008). Despite the growing interest of the agricultural research community in integrating IoT-enabled devices into production, to date, such technologies are not widely adopted by producers due to concerns associated with cost and return on investment (Narwane et al., 2022; Pillai & Sivathanu, 2020). More specifically, there is a need to understand the benefits and utilities of IoT from different perspectives (users, developers, and researchers) to fully utilize its potential to improve crop production under limited resources and climate change. Therefore, in this paper, we review existing literature and discuss the concepts, applications, potential challenges, and opportunities associated with IoT with a specific focus on its application in digital agriculture. First, we provide the concepts and technical details of different components of IoT, followed by its applications in digital agriculture, and associated challenges and opportunities. Overall, this review is expected to provide useful insights into how IoT could be integrated into the smart agriculture framework for improving crop productivity and food security in the face of climatic change and variability.\\n\\nCore Ideas\\nDifferent platforms, sensors, and structures of IoT in digital agriculture were reviewed.\\nThe application of IoT in data management, interoperability, and precision farming was reviewed.\\nPotential of IoT to improve agricultural quality and productivity was highlighted.\\nChallenges and opportunities of IoT in digital agriculture were discussed.\\n2 COMPONENTS OF THE IOT\\nThe key components of the IoT include IoT platforms, wireless sensor networks (WSNs), and the IoT structure. An IoT platform can be defined as an on-premises software suite or a cloud service (IoT platform as a service [PaaS]) that monitors and may manage and control different kinds of endpoints, generally through apps installed on the platform. Similarly, WSN refers to an infrastructure-less wireless network that is installed ad hoc in a large number of wireless sensors to monitor system, physical, or environmental factors. The structure of IoT largely consists of devices, network structure, and cloud technology that allow IoT devices to communicate with each other. These components are discussed separately below.\\n\\n2.1 IoT platforms\\nIoT platforms provide proprietary or open-source suite for controlling devices and data in IoT system. Various IoT platforms, both proprietary and open source, are currently available to handle data from diverse sources using different devices. They serve functions like ingestion, filtering, aggregation, storing, and computation of data (Jayaraman et al., 2016). These platforms support specific microcontrollers, transceivers, data and extension memory, and programming. Some select platforms in agriculture are available from Tzounis et al. (2017) and are discussed in detail as follows.\\n\\n2.1.1 FarmBot\\nFarmBot is an open-source precision agricultural project platform that consists of a farming machine, software, and a repository for farming data. The three main components of FarmBot include mechanisms for seed planting, a nutrient delivery system, and a universal tool mounting system. FarmBot is generally used in urban farming for monitoring plant growth parameters and predicting a suitable harvest date at a future point in time (Nugraha et al., 2020). FarmBot can plant seeds with a regular watering schedule and can be remotely accessed with ease from Internet-connected devices (Murdyantoro et al., 2019). It takes the location of each plant into account to facilitate essential nutrients and water application for optimal plant growth based on feedback from the online database of records from various agricultural fields. The main purpose of FarmBot technology is to optimize the quality and quantity of agricultural produce and to enhance resource efficiency. Arduino, an open-source hardware and software company, which manufactures microcontrollers, is used to control the FarmBot and is connected to the Internet using a Raspberry Pi 3 board. A decision support system (DSS) has been implemented to help in data-driven design, access to the open repository, and real-time control of the parameters. An Android application can be designed to monitor the stepper motor location to carry out different farm operations, plant seeds using the vacuum pump in the field, and capture images.\\n\\n2.1.2 Raspberry Pi\\nRaspberry Pi is a small, low-cost computer chip capable of being used with a computer monitor, mouse, and keyboard. The basic structure of a Raspberry Pi includes random access memory (RAM), a processor, USB ports, general purpose input/output pins, an Ethernet port, a full HDMI port, a camera interface, a display interface, and a micro SD card slot (Balamurugan et al., 2017). The Raspberry Pi has been used in a wide variety of applications in agricultural systems. The growing availability of Raspberry Pi with high processing capacity has enabled many remote sensing tasks in agriculture, including crop imaging, determination of soil fertility, crop yield estimation, and spraying of fertilizers (Mathe et al., 2022). Flores et al. (2016) utilized a Raspberry Pi as a local server to display the relative humidity, air temperature, soil moisture, soil electrical conductivity, and soil pH through the use of a graphical user interface. Kamath et al. (2019) used a Raspberry Pi to monitor weeds in paddy crops and Bluetooth 4.0 to send data to remote base station using visual sensor nodes. These sensor readings were then processed using machine learning models (e.g., support vector machines and random forests) to distinguish weeds from paddy crops using shape features.\\n\\n2.1.3 IRIS Mote\\nAn IRIS Mote (Crossbow) is a computing system consisting of a microcomputer plus one or more sensors that are connected wirelessly via a radio link. The IRIS Mote has one of the highest communication ranges (close to 500 m) using a 2.4 GHz IEEE 802.15.4 wireless module. It also includes an Intel XScale processor, 8 KB of RAM, 512 KB of flash memory, and a transmission rate of 250 kbps. The expansion connector has eight channel analog inputs. The IRIS Mote handles task scheduling and input/output processing (Liu et al., 2015) using an open-source TinyOS operating system based on an ATMega1281 low-power microcontroller (Sivagami et al., 2010). The transmission current of IRIS Mote is 10–17 mA, whereas the receiver current is 16 mA. The indoor communication range of the device is greater than 300 m, and the outdoor communication range is greater than 50 m (Narayanan et al., 2016). The underground communication range is reduced to less than 30 m due to interference in radio frequency communication. The IRIS Mote is used in small agricultural fields to monitor climatic and hydrologic parameters like rain, sunlight, humidity, and temperature of a system.\\n\\n2.1.4 Zolertia\\nThe Zolertia Z1 Mote (Zolertia S.L., Barcelona, Spain) is a platform designed for WSNs. It is compatible with TinyOS, OpenWSN, and RIOT OS. It supports analog and digital sensors and includes an MSP432 microcontroller, 8 KB of RAM, and 92 KB of flash memory. It can operate in the temperature range of −25 to −85°C. It is designed to work in the range of 0.3–3.6 V, powered by two 1.5 V AA standard batteries (Zolertia, 2010). Agricultural use of Zolertia has previously been reported in greenhouse-based tomato farming, where the attenuation of radio waves in the 2.4 GHz freeband was measured using a received signal strength indicator (Cama-Pinto et al., 2021). Zolertia Z1 Mote has also been used in determining agro-climatic variables like temperature and soil moisture in cassava (Manihot spp.) production (Caicedo-Ortiz et al., 2018).\\n\\n2.1.5 Node MicroController Unit\\nNode MicroController Unit (NodeMCU) is an open-source IoT platform with an ESP8266 microcontroller and Wi-Fi system on chip (SoC) from Expressif Systems, and hardware, which runs on an ESP-12 module. This firmware runs on Lua scripting language (Vanaja et al., 2018). It functions the same way as a Raspberry Pi in the case of agricultural applications and may be connected to various sensors for real-time monitoring of soil moisture, relative humidity, and air temperature. In one study, NodeMCU was used to monitor the environmental conditions of indoor greenhouses (Wan et al., 2019). A cloud-based platform has been used to store the environmental sensor readings and has been used for automatic irrigation systems for controlling agriculture pumps and remote monitoring systems resulting in increased economic benefits (Bentabet, 2020).\\n\\n2.1.6 Intel Galileo/Edison\\nThe Intel Galileo (Intel) board is based on Intel architecture (Intel Quark SoC X1000, 400 MHz processor) and is designed to have powerful functionalities with minimum power consumption. This allows users to apply shields compatible with Intel Galileo and extend the functionality of the board. It comprises two levels—legacy controlled blocks and microbuses. The legacy-controlled blocks are used for specific functions using dedicated channels. It has a dedicated point-to-point connection to connect to standard modules like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and SIM card modules for cell phones. The issues of these boards within agriculture are similar to that of the Raspberry Pi (Silpa et al., 2018). These boards are used in a house environment monitoring system, which helps in producing high-quality crops with minimal labor costs (Ajith et al., 2020). Some other applications are observed in the monitoring of soil pH and nutrients of cultivated crops (Sakthisudhan et al., 2019).\\n\\n2.2 Wireless sensor network\\nWSN is an important component of IoT, and its use in the agricultural sector has been widely discussed (Mahbub, 2020; Sanjeevi et al., 2020). A WSN is a wireless network consisting of spatially distributed sensors and sensor nodes to monitor physical or environmental conditions and transfer data to a base station. These systems are often inexpensive, scalable, and consist of mobile nodes (Kiani & Seyyedabbasi, 2018). Briefly, the WSN system consists of two major components, sensor nodes and sink nodes (base station) (Kocakulak & Butun, 2017). The sensor node consists of a power unit, a sensing unit, and a computing unit. These nodes may be placed inside or outside an agricultural field to continuously feed data to the base station. Depending on the ad hoc system configuration or network type, the sensor node could behave as a data originator or router. Sensor nodes can collect real-time physical or environmental conditions such as temperature, vibration, or motion time and produce sensory data (Pottie, 1998; Senouci & Mellouk, 2016). At the same time, the sink node collects sensor data and communicates with the end user via a direct connection. This connection between the sensor and sink nodes is established via the Internet, satellite, or any wireless link, and the data is accessed through an app or end-user interface.\\n\\n2.3 IoT structure\\nIoT structure is a system that helps in connecting objects to the Internet through information-sensing equipment to establish data exchange and communication and to monitor and manage digital systems (Ye et al., 2014). To achieve such functions, IoT uses the perception, network, and application layers, as well as the security strategy for each layer, as a part of its framework (Gou et al., 2013). The IoT structural hierarchy is shown in Figure 2 (Zhong et al., 2015), but more generalized structural components are discussed in sub-sections below. Different layers within the hierarchy are crucial to address issues like computational loss, poor access control, data leaks, malware risks, and cyberattacks (apriorit.com/dev-blog).\\n\\nDetails are in the caption following the image\\nFIGURE 2\\nOpen in figure viewer\\nHierarchy of the Internet of Things (IoT) structure.\\n2.3.1 The perception layer\\nThe perception layer is the foundation of IoT and is the interface between the physical world and the digital world. This layer functions as “nerve endings” collecting measured signals and transporting those signals to the rest of the system (Yang et al., 2012). It uses radio frequency identification technology, barcode technology, sensor, and positioning technology to complete information collection and helps in controlling the perception by the actuators. The main security issues in a perception layer are related to information collection and transmission as most sensors have a simple structure and processor and do not have complex security protection capabilities (Zhao & Ge, 2013).\\n\\n2.3.2 The network layer\\nThe network layer is generally composed of two layers—the network access layer and the network transmission layer. The access layer consists of a base station node and a gateway. Current methods of network access are Wi-Fi, Ad Hoc, Mesh, and Zigbee. The network transmission layer is responsible for the transmission and exchange of information, including satellite, mobile, and optical fiber communication networks. It is analogous to a person's nervous system and brain, which are used to transmit and cope with the information from the perception layer. The most common security issues in a network layer occur when a number of malicious nodes send data at the same time, which may lead to a denial of service attack (Bello et al., 2017).\\n\\n2.3.3 The application layer\\nThe application layer is generally composed of two layers—the application support layer and the application presentation layer. The support layer is responsible for data storage, information processing, and the exchange of information. The presentation layer is used for processing data from the application support layer. It uses technology with multimedia, virtual reality, and human–computer interfaces to connect the IoT and the user. The main security issues concerning the application layer may include data access permission, identity authentication, data protection and recovery, big data handling, and software vulnerabilities, among others (Karagiannis et al., 2015).\\n\\n3 APPLICATIONS OF IOT IN DIGITAL AGRICULTURE\\nDigital agriculture is directly linked with IoT. Indeed, IoT offers multiple applications in the production, circulation, and modernization of farming businesses (Chen & Jin, 2012; Ozdogan et al., 2017). The term “digital agriculture” refers to the on-farm and off-farm uses and applications of data based on location, weather, energy use, or other factor using sensors, machines, or satellites to monitor animals, plants, or soil (Klerkx et al., 2019). It integrates concepts from precision and smart farming. The basic framework (Tang et al., 2002) of digital agriculture includes:\\nAgricultural databases that include information about farmlands, climatic conditions, and socioeconomic background that relates agricultural activities to the human society.\\n\\nReal-time monitoring and updating of information in the database about meteorology, vegetation, and soil information on and under the ground using in situ and satellite-based sensors.\\n\\nA network transmission and processing system to analyze collected information, make decisions, and transfer signals in controlling the functions of agricultural machinery.\\n\\nThe actuation framework that includes digitized sowing and harvesting devices enabled with Geographic Information System and Global Position Satellite systems.\\n\\nDifferent crop, soil, and weather sensors are increasingly used in monitoring plant growth, diseases, pests, yield, weather variables (temperature, humidity, rain, air, etc.), and soil physical–chemical and hydraulic properties (Acharya et al., 2017; Sehgal et al., 2005). Sensors are used in real-time monitoring and reporting of agricultural parameters in the value chain, cloud computing, and integration of these processes with advanced technologies like UAVs and satellites to enable highly efficient, qualitative, profitable, and environmentally sound agricultural decision-making. Sensor-based data is also utilized in formulating predictive models to forecast crop yield (Supit et al., 2012). Some applications of IoT systems in digital agriculture are discussed as follows.\\n\\n3.1 UAVs in digital agriculture\\nTraditionally, satellites have been used to detect spectral responses from plants and soil (Dematte et al., 2018). However, satellite data is often of coarse resolution that is not applicable for canopy and plot scale applications and is not available regularly due to cloud cover and sensor property. UAVs provide a noninvasive and cost-effective approach to collect data at a much finer scale at the desired time scale. UAVs are defined as “a set of configurable elements consisting of a remotely piloted aircraft, its associated remote pilot station(s), the required command and control links, and any other system elements as may be required, at any point during flight operation” (International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO). UAV-derived images can be processed to monitor and predict plant growth parameters, disease and pest incidence, yield, and different soil physical and hydraulic properties.\\n\\nNowadays, smart technologies have been built into UAVs by integrating open-source technology, autonomous programs, smart sensors, and payloads (Puri et al., 2017). Different hyperspectral, multispectral, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors can be mounted to the UAVs for near real-time monitoring of vegetation conditions, extraction of soil and vegetation indices (Ni et al., 2018), and predicting LAI. For example, multispectral sensors are increasingly used to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference red-edge index, leaf water content index, soil-adjusted vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, tile drainage, and plant water status by capturing the reflectance including those in visible, near-infrared, and shortwave regions of the electromagnetic radiation (Tables 2 and 3).\\n\\nTABLE 2.

Two widely used UAVs include fixed-wing and rotary-wing UAVs (Dileep et al., 2020). Fixed-wing UAVs use airplane-like wings to generate lift and to move forward. Some of their properties include lower cost, higher endurance, and greater flight speed as compared to rotary-wing UAVs. Contrastingly, rotary-wing UAVs use rotor blades and are characterized by vertical takeoff and landing capacity, lower flight altitude, and lower flight speed. UAVs may be used for mid-season crop health monitoring of vegetative indices using near-infrared and other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum that cannot be sensed by the human eye (Table 3; Cancela et al., 2019; Ren et al., 2020; Veroustraete, 2015). Pathak et al. (2020) reported the use of UAVs in spraying herbicides on up to 20–40 ha per day and to further eradicate farmers’ direct contact with poisonous chemicals and hazardous operational conditions. UAVs can be used to generate variable-rate application maps from the images to determine the strength of nutrient uptake in a single field. This has the potential to further minimize fertilizer costs and optimize crop yield (Kulbacki et al., 2018). UAV-based LiDAR systems and software have shown potential in stitching together thousands of high-quality aerial photographs to develop 3D maps for monitoring soil erosion and developing conservation strategies (Acharya et al., 2021). More recently, new types of aerial imagery and satellite (e.g., PlanetLab) have shown tremendous potential in monitoring crops, making informed decisions, and increasing yield (Cai et al., 2019).\\n\\nTABLE 4.

The objective of this work was to present the newly developed Android smartphone application to calculate crop evapotranspiration in real-time to support field-scale irrigation management. As part of the answer to water shortage, we embraced technology by developing AgSAT, a Google Earth Engine-based application that optimizes water use for food production. AgSAT uses meteorological data to calculate daily water requirements using the ASCE-Penman–Monteith method (ETref) and vegetation indices from satellite imagery to derive the basal crop growth coefficient, Kcb. The performance of AgSAT to estimate ETref was assessed using climatic data from 18 meteorological stations distributed over several climatic zones worldwide. ETref estimation through the app showed acceptable results with values of 1.27, 0.9, 0.79, 0.95, and 0.5 for root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (r), modeling efficiency (NSE), concordance index (d), and percentage bias (Pbias), respectively. AgSAT guides gross irrigation requirements for crops and rationalizes water quantities used in agricultural production. AgSAT has been released, is currently in use by research scientists, agricultural producers, and irrigation managers, and is freely accessible from the Google Play and IOS Store and also at agsat.app. Our work is geared towards the development of remote sensing-based technologies that transfer significant benefits to farmers and water-saving efforts.Keywords: precision farming; smart irrigation; food production; remote sensing; smart-phone application; Sentinel-2; AgSAT1. IntroductionAbout 85% of the total water resources available worldwide are exclusively used for irrigation purposes [1]. Smartly managing these freshwater resources for precision irrigation in agriculture is essential for enhancing crop yield and water productivity, improving irrigation scheduling, and decreasing farming costs while sustaining the environment [2,3,4,5,6,7]. Smart irrigation scheduling has evolved from computer-based tools and programs such as CROPWAT [8], consumptive use program (CUP) [9], and Washington Irrigation Scheduling Expert (WISE) [10], to recently incorporate the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT emerged as the means for smart water management applications by offering easy-to-use methods and real-time scheduling regarding water availability, crop water requirements, soil and weather conditions, and crop response to stress. In this context, a shift from traditional irrigation methods to real-time smart irrigation automation using low-cost sensors, weather data, and water balance or evapotranspiration modeling approaches is now gaining attention [11].Many researchers reported using internet and communication tools (ICT) in irrigation applications [12,13]. ICT include cloud-based technologies for data acquisition transmission and management, soil–plant–atmosphere and irrigation performance monitoring, and remote control of the irrigation process [14]. The literature shows a plethora of applications of ICT in irrigation systems at the irrigation district-scale including using remote sensing, crop modeling, linear regressions, and neural approaches for water demand forecast, and remote control of irrigation processes (see, for example, Bartlett et al. [15]; Sesma et al. [16], Pulido-Calvo et al. [17]). Perea et al. [18] established an ICT-based system for scheduling and managing irrigation at the micro-scale level (i.e., a strawberry farm), using the principles of precision irrigation. However, many of these tools remain within the realm of research institutions, and few reach out to farmers for direct field applications, leaving them with limited on-farm technology access and with reliance on traditional irrigation scheduling methods that often reduce yield and water productivity.There is also growing attention towards the development of web and software-based irrigation scheduling tools for estimating site-specific water requirements at various scales, which has better chances of farmer’s accessibility. One of the most significant advantages of using smartphone applications is that they represent instances of portable and simple-to-use technology, allowing for real-time decision-making. Some of these tools integrate real-time weather data with crop-specific ET or water budgeting methods [19,20,21]. Some web-based applications have also been developed, such as Wateright [22], and Crop Manage [23]. Moreover, several public agencies have developed online irrigation scheduling services, including IRRINET in Italy [24], IrriSatSMS [25] in Australia, IRRISA in France [26], and ISS-ITAP in Spain [27].Although the earlier mentioned irrigation scheduling systems’ (e.g., ICs, sensors, web platforms, apps, and online irrigation services) costs are generally falling, for growers of moderate- to low-profit crops, this technology may still be cost-unaffordable if it does not significantly increase farmer income [28]. In addition, the computerized irrigation technologies have limited on-field applicability due to the need for desktop computers, which represents one other significant barrier that hampers their adoption by farmers. Such web-based tools may have limited user interaction and rely heavily on frequent user-follow up using a laptop or desktop computer. Farmers readily adopt simple technologies that require limited knowledge and skills, such as auto-steer machinery, irrigation pivots, sprinklers, and others. However, the implementation of information-intensive technologies is often limited. These innovations may require further investments in hiring external services to train farmers [29,30,31]. While the available literature has tended to focus on major advancements in smart irrigation applications, many agricultural regions in the world lack the availability of the above technologies. Less-skilled farmers in countries where agriculture is viewed as a chief economic sector are often held back from the potential adoption of such technologies.The increased use of smartphones, combined with weather data availability, has created an excellent environment for developing and deploying smartphone applications for calculating crop water requirements in near real-time. Several smart irrigation mobile apps were designed using this approach. In contrast to web-based tools, smartphone applications provide increased operational flexibility, simplicity in control, and continuous user–tool interaction. Smart Irrigation apps (for example, those developed by the Universities of Florida and Georgia) may offer real-time irrigation schedules for commercially valuable seasonal and perennial selected crops, including strawberry, avocado, citrus, peanut, cotton, and vegetables. The irrigation schedule is based on the integration of weather and short-term forecasted data with crop evapotranspiration (ETc) or water balance approach. Such apps are customized according to the users’ practices in terms of the used irrigation systems, splitting irrigation events, water conservation options, and other management methods. While the limitation of these apps is the spatial variability of rainfall, their validation over multiple seasons at field level in water savings for lawn, tomato, and citrus are 57, 33, and 24%, respectively [18,32,33]. Blueleaf is another example of a smartphone application developed in partnership with IAM (Institut Agronomique Méditerannéen) of Bari (Italy), the CNR of Italy, and a consortium of Italian enterprises [12]. Daily soil-water balance is modeled based on station weather data, and farmers need to add a range of required information into the application and install a soil moisture probe, making the app laborious to use. Another example of smartphone apps with similar capabilities is the Colorado State University WISE Irrigation Scheduler [15]. Recently, the EVAPO app was developed that provides reference point ET data based on the NASA-POWER system. However, the grid size of the weather data has a spatial resolution of 1 × 1°, or 12347 km2 (111.12 × 111.12 km) at the equator [34].Evapotranspiration is a key parameter for hydrological and climatological studies, as well as for agricultural water resources management, such as irrigation management and planning. Several empirical methods to estimate reference evapotranspiration have been developed in the past 50 years, with the ASCE-Penman–Monteith method being the most accurate one under different climatic conditions [35]. The availability of high spatial resolutions of satellite imagery that is publicly available nowadays (such as the Sentinel-2 imagery from the Copernicus mission of the European Space Agency) and the long period of records of Landsat imagery provides opportunities to develop operational and global evapotranspiration (ET) datasets at field scales [36]. Our innovation avoids scalability limitations and diverts from the availability of on-farm weather stations and soil sensors.We developed the first global smart irrigation application (AgSAT), that relies on remote sensing and gridded global weather data forecasts and, as such, has near real-time operational capability. The application was released to the Google Play store in English and Arabic. The app performs on-demand satellite and climate data processing through Google’s Earth Engine-enabling environment. It provides crop water requirements based on crop growth coefficients derived from remotely sensed vegetation indices at a resolution of 10m and based on reference evapotranspiration calculated every six hours and populated to the daily interval from the coupled rorecast system model version 2 (CFSV2). The objectives of this study were to (1) provide a general overview of the AgSAT app, (2) evaluate the remote-sensing-based approach for calculating ETref through comparison against meteorological data collected from 18 weather stations at various locations in different climatic regions and temporal scales (daily and monthly), and (3) asses the remotely sensed estimates of ETref and Kc at plot scale over an irrigated potato field, located in Lebanon at the Agriculture Research and Education Center (AREC) during the growing season of 12 March–15 July 2020. Therefore, we aimed to demonstrate the operational application of AgSAT to monitor irrigation water use at the field level and global scales.2. AgSAT App Conceptual Framework2.1. Model Overview: Crop Water Requirement Based on FAO 56 ApproachSeveral studies have reported that the FAO-56 Penman–Monteith (FAO-PM) model, which has been tested in many regions of the world, is renowned for being the most accurate under different climatic conditions [35]. The model for crop water requirements used in the AgSAT app is based on the FAO-56 approach. We provided, herein, a brief description of the main calculations. The FAO-56 is based on the concept of reference evapotranspiration for standard, well-watered crops by crop coefficients to account for the influences of ET during the growing season. Therefore, the actual crop evapotranspiration is estimated as follows:𝐸𝑇=𝐾𝑐𝑏×𝐸𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓(1)where ET is the actual evapotranspiration, Kcb is the basal crop coefficient, and ETref is the reference evapotranspiration.AgSAT calculates the ASCE Standardized Penman–Monteith evapotranspiration product (ETref) using the 6 h CFSV2 gridded (0.2 arc degrees) weather dataset available in Google Earth Engine data generated by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [36]. The CFSV2 version 2 was developed at the Environmental Modeling Center at NCEP. CFSV2 is a fully coupled model representing the interaction between the Earth’s atmosphere, oceans, land, and sea ice. Currently, CFSV2 is the global weather reanalysis and forecast with the highest temporal and spatial resolution to allow for real-time reference evapotranspiration calculations and forecasts on Google Earth Engine. Other available datasets or systems (e.g., GLDAS, NASA-POWER, ECMWF) are either unavailable in near real-time unless paid for or have a lower resolution. Each grid of the CFSV2 file covers an approximate area of 490 km2. We used the weather variables in Table 1 for deriving ETref after adjusting the wind-speed to 2 m height. In the ASCE-Penman–Monteith equation, the surface resistance rs is computed from the leaf area index (LAI), which is a function of the height specified for the reference type, usually either grass or alfalfa. Algorithms for LAI depend on the reference type. Therefore, the value of rs (and the aerodynamic resistance ra) will change with the height specified for the reference. Based on the ASCE LAI algorithms, the values for rs for 24-hour time steps are rs = 70 s m−1 for 0.12 m tall grass and rs = 45 s m−1 for 0.5 m tall alfalfa. Because the Penman–Monteith equation is well-documented in the scientific literature, we did not repeat its presentation in this paper.Table 1. Agrometeorological data from CFSV2, used for estimating the potential evapotranspiration (PET) (a product of the reference evapotranspiration (ETref) and the basal crop coefficient (Kcb)) computed using the standardized ASCE-Penman–Monteith equation.The basal crop coefficient (Kcb) is a major variable determining crop transpiration, and its estimation is necessary to determine crop water use. Crop coefficients have been shown to correlate well with satellite-based vegetation indices, making their remote estimation from operational platforms practical [37,38,39]. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and other vegetation indices such as the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) have been used as the main operational parameters to monitor vegetation status using Earth Observation. These indices rely on the difference in reflectance of vegetation (between the near-infrared band heavily reflected by healthy vegetation and the red-band absorbed for photosynthesis). In 2015, the Copernicus ESA mission made available the highest resolution (10 m) remotely sensed satellite imagery from the Sentinel-2 satellite. Sentinel-2 is now available at 5-day revisit time, making its utilization in vegetation monitoring helpful. We utilized the red (Band 4) and the near-infrared band (Band 8A) of Sentinel-2 to derive the normalized difference vegetation index and the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI). Several researchers have provided empirical equations to derive the crop coefficients from the NDVI and SAVI [38,40,41,42,43]. Kamble, Kilic, and Hubbard [38] developed a simple linear regression model between Kcb calculated from the flux data measured for different crops and cropping practices using AmeriFlux towers and MODIS NDVI. We adopted equations from the literature to derive Kcb according to crop type (Table A1). We used a generic equation to calculate the crop coefficient surrogate for crops that do not have a corresponding NDVI–Kcb relationship. First, NDVI is transformed into a fractional vegetative cover (Fc) via empirical relationships developed by USDA and NASA [37] as follows:𝐹𝑐=1.26×𝑁𝐷𝑉𝐼−0.18(2)Kcb is determined using the generic equation as established by Melton et al. [44] following methods described by Allen and Pereira [45]:𝐾𝑐𝑏=−0.4766×𝐹2𝑐+1.4048×𝐹𝑐+0.15(3)For the derived NDVI/SAVI at 10 m, we masked out pixels of cloud shadow, adjacent cloud, cloud, and cirrus. We interpolated the NDVI/SAVI from the latest available image for masked pixels to a daily time step. The interpolated NDVI/SAVI were then used to calculate the crop growth coefficient. Finally, the crop coefficient is multiplied by the daily reference evapotranspiration for the field location as calculated from the gridded weather data and forecasts for that location.To calculate irrigation requirements, we prompt the user to input the on-farm irrigation system, from which an irrigation efficiency can be assumed (Table 2), based on [46].Table 2. Suggested irrigation efficiencies based on pressurized irrigation system types.Irrigation efficiencies are used to calculate the gross irrigation requirement only if the user delineates the field area (gross irrigation requirement= (net irrigation requirement/irrigation efficiency) * Area, where net irrigation requirement is the actual crop water requirements calculated with an assumption of zero rainfall). Hence, gross water irrigation requirements are provided under dry weather conditions. Once the user selects the valve size irrigating the field, run-times (run time = total irrigation requirement/ discharge of the water pump) are calculated from flow rates assuming design water flow velocity in closed pipes of 1.5 m/s (which is recommended for flow in pressurized closed conduits). Run-times are not calculated for surface irrigation systems and only refer to the total duration of irrigation needed for the field given the system type, the field area, and the valve size (main or submain pipe size irrigating the field). No leaching requirement is included in adjusting the run-time values, and it is assumed that the irrigation efficiencies will handle necessary leaching, except for saline soils or irrigation water. AgSAT also provides a five-day irrigation volume requirement should the user decide to lump irrigations every five days in case the maximum available water in the root zone permits (applicable in almost all soils expect sandy soils and shallow root-zone crops or crops at the initial stages of development which may require more frequent irrigations with small amounts). The system components and workflow of the app are shown in Figure 1.Figure 1. The workflow of the AgSAT application.2.2. General Overview of AgSAT AppAgSAT is a smartphone app developed to support irrigation management. This application estimates crop water-use and irrigation demand for several crops at a daily time step. Through a user-friendly interface, farmers can input information specific to their farms. Figure 2 provides a snapshot of the application interface. As the application launches, the user is prompted to grant the app permission to read the location of the device. After that, the user can either pinpoint the field of interest or can simply delineate the field and save it after being prompted to select crop type, irrigation system type (used to estimate irrigation efficiencies), and irrigation pipe size (for delineated fields only, and it ranges from 1′′ to 6′′) from a drop-down list. In conjunction with the data provided by the user, AgSAT provides crop water requirements based on crop growth coefficients derived from remotely sensed vegetation indices (NDVI, SAVI, and Kcb) at a resolution of 10 m and based on reference evapotranspiration calculated every six hours and populated to the daily interval from the coupled forecast system model version 2 (CFSV2). In the ‘history’ tab of the application, five days forecast of irrigation requirements based on ET and Kcb forecasts from preceding satellite imagery is provided. The results are displayed for the user in a popup window with a description for each variable, including crop evapotranspiration (mm/day), the total volume of water requirements (m3/day), and irrigation run-time (based on a system velocity of 1.5 m/s).Figure 2. The mobile user interface of the AgSAT Android smartphone application.2.3. AgSAT Technical SpecificationsThe app was developed using Java Programming Language for devices with android operational systems. It is available on the Play store for download in two languages (English and Arabic). AgSAT is supported on Android phones with operational system versions 5.1 and above. We used several external libraries to support different functionalities within the app (OKHTTP for support HTTP requests, Firebase AUTH, Firebase Database, Play Core, and MP Android Chart). We used the Firebase Real-Time Database to store and fetch data and Firestore to store assets. Google maps, supported by Maps SDK (Software Development Kit) for Android Utility Library, is the main activity where users can delineate their field(s). AgSAT would require minimum user input to provide precise irrigation values based on advanced back-end computations. Upon clicking the ‘delineate field’ button, the user is prompted to select different field attributes: pipe size (ranging from 1′′ to 6′′), pump strength, and crop type. Once the user selects these details and assigns the corners of the field, the ‘Calculate ET’ button must be clicked to trigger an API request necessary for fetching irrigation usage data for the selected location, considering its latitude and longitude as per Google maps. The returned API results are displayed for the user in a popup window with a description for each value. Additionally, the irrigation forecast along with the irrigation history for already existing fields are displayed in a graph to monitor variations. Another feature of AgSAT is the ability for a user to specify a point location, save it, name a field from the selected point, and get the irrigation value of this point. A field of 50 by 50 m is mimicked for ET calculations by default for a point selection.The app allows the user to save the selected field information. Once the current field is saved, a screenshot of the delineated field with Google Earth Imagery as the background is captured and stored in the Firebase Database by the users’ device ID. The app allows to list all the selected fields, fetched by device ID as an index. To ensure privacy, users are authenticated anonymously on Firebase with a unique ID. The user is then taken back to the main map page where a new field is selected, and field information is specified. The area of the field and the recommended irrigation duration are calculated in the background.3. AgSAT ETref Performance Analyses3.1. Direct Validation of AgSAT ETref against ETref from Various Weather Stations WorldwideTo evaluate the performance of AgSAT, we compared ETref estimated by the AgSAT with the ETref calculated from meteorological data collected from 18 weather stations at various locations in different climatic regions worldwide (USA, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia) (Figure 3). The daily station ETref equation was calculated using the REF-ET software of the University of Idaho. The agrometeorological data used from weather stations were temperature (°C), solar radiation (W m−2), and wind speed (m s−1). Some weather networks included hourly minimum and maximum temperatures. At this step, the daily min/max values were taken as the minimum of the hourly minimum temperatures and a maximum of the hourly maximum temperatures. Clear sky solar radiation was used when solar radiation data was missing. Solar radiation was calculated as recommended in Allen, Walter, Elliott, Howell, Itenfisu, Jensen, and Snyder [36]. Both AgSAT and station ETref evaluations were performed on a daily time step since a day is a typical time period over which ETref is calculated and is generally the shortest period in which irrigation practices are scheduled. The station location, longitude, latitude, elevation, climate zones, and period of record for the available data needed for comparison are shown in Table 3.Figure 3. Location of the 18 weather stations used in the study.Table 3. Coordinates, altitude, elevation, wind speed height, climate, and source of studied sites.Goodness-of-fit parameters, primarily the root mean square error (RMSE), percentage bias (Pbias), correlation coefficient (r), the concordance index (d), and the Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE), were applied to evaluate modeled ETref against the observed ETref.The average difference between the ETref from AgSAT and the ETref from the weather stations was described by root mean square error (RMSE) as:𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸=∑𝑛𝑖=1(𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑖−𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑖)2𝑛−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−√(4)The percentage bias (Pbias) was used to indicate under/over estimations by the ETref derived from AgSAT as:𝑃𝑏𝑖𝑎𝑠=∑𝑛𝑖=1𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑖−𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑖∑𝑛𝑖=1𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑖×100(5)We also used Pearson’s r, which is the most used parametric correlation coefficient to quantify the strength of the linear relationship between ETref estimated and measured, given by:𝑟= ∑𝑛𝑖(𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑖−𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑖)(𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑖−𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑖)∑𝑛𝑖(𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑖−𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑖)2−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−√×∑𝑛𝑖(𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑇𝑟𝑓−𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓)2−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−−√(6)Then, concordance index (d) which represents the ratio between the mean square error and the potential error. d is a descriptive parameter which varies between 0 and 1, with a value of 1 indicating excellent agreement. d is calculated as:𝑑=1−∑𝑛𝑖=1(𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑖−𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑖)2∑𝑛𝑖=1(|𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑖−𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑖|+|𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑖−𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑖|)2(7)Additionally, the modeling efficiency (NSE) is a normalized statistical parameter which determined the relative magnitude of residual variance with respect to the measured data variance. The model validity is considered very good for NSE ranges: 0.9–1, good for NSE ranges: 0.8–0.8999, acceptable for NSE: 0.65–0.799, and unsatisfactory for NSE: <0.65.𝑁𝑆𝐸=1−∑𝑛𝑖=1(𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑖−𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑖)2∑𝑛𝑖=1(|𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑖−𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝐸𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑖|)2(8)3.2. Field ValidationThe app’s performance was tested by experimenting in the Bekaa Valley, the food basket of Lebanon. This valley is one of the country’s most important agricultural production areas where water-use estimates are critical for water management and resilience [47]. The primary driver threatening farmers to use less irrigation water for food production is the valley’s growing water constraint. The experimental field (1-ha) is located at the Agriculture Research and Education Center at AREC and planted with a potato crop during 12 March–15 July 2020: the growing season. The field was irrigated with a micro-sprinkler system (5 × 5 spacing at 200 L/h for a sprinkler) using the AgSAT-app irrigation recommendations. Irrigations were set at 4–5 day intervals with timings populated from the AgSAT app. The irrigation scheduling experiment consisted of four plots of equal size. Each plot had its own flow meter installed on the laterals to monitor the amount of water irrigated. The main weather parameters were taken from a Delta-T Devices weather station located upwind within the field and used to calculate ETref by the FAO Penman–Monteith standard approach. Water lost due to wind drift and evaporation was estimated using a catch-can test at the beginning of the irrigation season. In addition, soil moisture and crop yield measurements were held. A deep soil-water sensor at 60 cm was installed to monitor deep percolation.4. Results and Discussion4.1. Global ValidationAgSAT daily ETref aligned with the in situ measurements of reference evapotranspiration from 18 weather stations (n = 46385) worldwide. Daily ETref was reasonably predicted by the AgSAT model, as suggested by the relatively low spread of most points in the scatter plots, close to the 1:1 line (Figure 4). Generally, RMSE was relatively low (1.27 mm/d), with a very small percentage of error (Pbias) (0.5%) driven by a slight positive bias (0.02 mm/d). The NSE value of 0.79 shows that the AgSAT model can be classified as acceptable. The concordance index (d) approaches 1, indicating very good agreement between AgSAT ETref and station ETref. The comparative analysis of the AgSAT and the weather stations’ daily reference evapotranspiration at a site level is shown in Figure A1, colored by climate type. Additional accuracy statistics are shown in Table A2 at a site level, including MAE, MBE, RE, and MAPE. Accuracy statistics of AgSAT ETref comparison with station ETref at the 18 studied sites by climate are shown in Figure A2.Figure 4. AgSAT reference evapotranspiration comparison with in situ measurements of reference evapotranspiration from 18 weather stations.The plot shows that AgSAT ETref agrees very well with the station ETref, with an index of agreement ranging from 0.8 to 0.98. The highest index of agreement was apparent in California and Lebanon, indicating the suitability of AgSAT for use in semi-arid and arid regions where agriculture relies on irrigation water and where water is scarce. The lowest error was obtained at the Ireland station (RMSE of 0.62 mm/d, driven by a slight positive bias of −0.4 mm/d). The most significant error was observed at the Adrar station in Algeria, with the highest RMSE (2.29 mm/d), driven by a negative bias of −1.91 mm/d. AgSAT ETref tended in the opposite direction at a site level, where it overestimated ETref at the Rafha, KSA (by 23%) and underestimated ETref at the Adrar, Algeria stations (by −22%). This could be due to the site hyperaridity where reference conditions were not met; no adjustments were made to correct station data. Very good model skills were observed at most of the stations (e.g., most of the stations such as Monastir, Tunisia, Aguas Emendadas, Brazil, and Roches point, Ireland have very low mean bias error). We did not find any substantial Pbias in the AgSAT ETref estimation at all sites where Pbias remained below 23%. AgSAT ETref was further evaluated across climatic zones. The ETref model revealed variability in model skill (Figure A2). The most notable finding in group-wise analysis based on climate was a general trend in bias, with AgSAT ETref model underestimating ET in Dfb (humid continental) climates and overestimating in humid subtropical (Cfa) climates. Based on nearly all statistical measures, AgSAT ETref performed best in Mediterranean climates (Csa).4.2. Field ValidationThe total water applied during the irrigation season was 590 mm. Water lost to wind drift and evaporation was estimated at 15–20% (depending on the irrigation time and wind speed) of applied water. Total water reaching the soil was estimated at 487 mm. Soil water content at planting was at field capacity following an above-average rainfall at the site. The clay soil-available water in the root zone on 12 March 2020 was 65 mm for 50 cm of the maximum potato root depth measured on-site for the duration of the experiment. No deep percolation was observed during the duration of the experiment. The amount of water used by the crop was estimated at 521 mm. The AgSAT app calculated a total ET of 531 mm for the period May 1–July 31. The resulting potato yield was 60 tons/ha from plot 1, 53 tons/ha from plots 2 and 3, and 46 tons/ha from plot 4 (due to weed infestations), indicating a superb yield. Figure 5 shows the Kcb, ETref, and ETpot (potential evapotranspiration) derived from the app. The Kcb values matched those indicated for the planted potato crop (Figure 6) [35].Figure 5.

      "    \"explanation\": \"This paper presents a study that compares two decision support systems for irrigation management, ISSCADA and SETMI, in terms of crop yield, seasonal applied irrigation, and crop water productivity (CWP). The study conducted a side-by-side comparison of each system applied to several irrigation levels.  The authors found that ISSCADA prescribed the least irrigation among the dataset, while the common practice prescribed the largest seasonal irrigation. There were no significant differences observed in crop yield between the different irrigation methods in either year of the study. The CWP, which measures the efficiency of irrigation in producing crop yields, ranged from 2.72 to 4.24 kg m−3 for maize and 1.03 to 2 CWP, indicating that deficit level (50%) had better irrigation water productivity. Overall, the research concludes that both the ISSCADA and SETMI systems can reduce irrigation applications while maintaining crop yield, which are favorable elements in advancing precision irrigation practices.\",\n",

The authors designed, constructed, and tested an automated controlled subsurface irrigation system (CSIS) using IoT solutions and ThingSpeak cloud platform to improve irrigation management of date palms. The system includes a network of sensors to monitor soil moisture and climatic parameters, and an algorithmic analysis module to determine the optimal irrigation schedule. The study results indicate that the CSIS effectively controls the irrigation water amount by applying it at the right time and directly in the functional root zone, reducing irrigation water consumption and enhancing water productivity. The authors emphasize that the designed system can make irrigation decisions based on direct measurement of volumetric water content (VWC), and highlight the potential benefits of using IoT in irrigation management to improve water use efficiency in arid regions. However, the paper does not discuss the automation of data processing or the seamless integration of each section in the irrigation management pipeline.\",\n",

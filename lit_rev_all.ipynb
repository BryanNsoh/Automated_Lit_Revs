The paper emphasizes the importance of improving water productivity in agriculture, exploring alternative water sources such as grazing lands, and considering socioeconomic factors in addressing the global food challenge.

The system uses an autonomous sensors network to collect climatic parameters and volumetric soil water content in real time and employs the ThingSpeak cloud platform for data hosting, algorithmic analysis, instant data visualization, event-based alerts, and automated actions. The validation of the CSIS proved that automatically irrigating date palm trees controlled by sensor-based irrigation scheduling (S-BIS) is more efficient than time-based irrigation scheduling (T-BIS) and traditional surface irrigation. The S-BIS provided the date palm with the optimum irrigation water amount at the opportune time directly in the functional root zone. Generally, the S-BIS and T-BIS of CSIS reduced the applied irrigation water amount by 64.1% and 61.2%, respectively, compared with traditional surface irrigation. The total annual amount of applied irrigation water for CSIS with S-BIS method, CSIS with T-BIS method, and TSI was 21.04, 22.76, and 58.71 m3 palm−1, respectively. The water productivity at the CSIS with S-BIS (1.783 kg m−3) and T-BIS (1.44 kg m−3) methods was significantly higher compared to the TSI (0.531 kg m−3). The CSIS with the S-BIS method kept the volumetric water content in the functional root zone next to the field capacity compared to the T-BIS method. The automated CSIS with the S-BIS method has a positive impact on irrigation water management and enhancement of fruit yield of the date palm and is quite proper for date palm irrigation in the arid regions.\",\n",

The results showed that N2O emissions were primarily affected by urea application and irrigation methods, with urea application being most important. Compared with CF irrigation, mild AWD irrigation increased cumulative N2O emissions, with an average increase of 28.8%. In addition, adding rice straw to mild AWD irrigation further stimulated N2O emissions by 18.1%. Under the condition of urea application, compared with CF irrigation, mild AWD irrigation increased the yield-scaled N2O emissions by 17.9%, and the addition of rice straw further promoted the yield-scaled N2O emissions under mild AWD irrigation by 17.4% but reduced the global warming potential (GWP) (methane (CH4)+N2O) by 62.9%. Under the condition of urea application, compared with CF irrigation, mild AWD irrigation reduced the uptake of soil-derived N and aboveground biomass of rice but did not reduce rice yield. Therefore, mild AWD irrigation combined with rice straw return may be a promising agronomic method to maintain rice yield, reduce GHGs, and protect or improve soil fertility.\",\n",

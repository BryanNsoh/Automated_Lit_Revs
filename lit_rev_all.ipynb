Temporal and spatial changes in soil water content (SWC), electrical conductivities of the saturation paste extract (ECe), and isotope ratios of soil water, irrigation water, and root water uptake were measured in plots irrigated with brackish water at low (LB), medium (MB), and high (HB) irrigation depths and compared with freshwater irrigated with a medium irrigation depth (MF). \\n\\nThe HYDRUS (2D/3D) model was used to simulate soil water and salt processes under different irrigation treatments, with model parameters adjusted until good agreement between simulated and observed SWC and ECe was achieved. The stable isotope tracers were used to calibrate and verify the accuracy of the model simulations. The results demonstrated the reliability of using combined stable oxygen isotope tracers and the HYDRUS (2D/3D) model for quantifying the movement of soil water and salts, which was important to determine the proportion and balance of soil water and salt for root water uptake. \\n\\nThe results indicated that increasing irrigation depth increased the average root water uptake. Root water uptake was mainly from the 0–20 cm soil layer under all irrigation treatments, and no apparent differences were found among different treatments. Additionally, irrigation depth had a significant effect on the salt content in the soil-plant system. A lower irrigation depth of brackish water was recommended for irrigation, which can effectively alleviate salt stress on crop growth and significantly save freshwater resources in arid and semi-arid regions. \\n\\nThe study results also showed that HYDRUS (2D/3D) could accurately simulate SWC and ECe under different irrigation treatments, with root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.004–0.017 cm3 cm−3 and 0.023–0.372 dS m−1 for SWC and ECe, respectively. The isotope data were used to verify the water fluxes simulated by HYDRUS (2D/3D): YS 0-40 = 73.5%, YS 40-100 = 25.6%, YW 0-100 = 0.9%, and WR = 0.0%. \\n\\nThis integrated approach combining experimental measurements and numerical simulations provided a comprehensive understanding of water and salt dynamics in a soil-plant system under brackish water irrigation.\",\n",

The authors highlight the limitations of traditional irrigation methods, emphasizing the need for automation to address challenges such as labor intensiveness, inefficient water use, and limited adaptability to changing conditions.\\n\\nSpecifically, the paper defines irrigation scheduling as \\\"the process of determining the optimal timing, duration, and amount of water to apply to a crop to meet its water requirements.\\\" This definition encapsulates the core concept of irrigation management and sets the stage for the subsequent discussion on automated systems. Additionally, the authors emphasize the importance of irrigation management in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity, reinforcing the significance of the topic within the context of the review's broader objectives.\",\n",

The study was conducted in a pot experiment, with treatments involving different irrigation methods (continuous flooding and mild alternate wetting and drying), nitrogen application levels (0 and 225kgNha−1), and rice straw return levels (0 and 9000kgha−1). The results showed that N2O emissions were primarily affected by urea application and irrigation methods, with urea application being most important. Compared with continuous flooding irrigation, mild alternate wetting and drying irrigation increased cumulative N2O emissions, with an average increase of 28.8%. In addition, adding rice straw to mild alternate wetting and drying irrigation further stimulated N2O emissions by 18.1%. Under the condition of urea application, compared with continuous flooding irrigation, mild alternate wetting and drying irrigation increased the yield-scaled N2O emissions by 17.9%, and the addition of rice straw further promoted the yield-scaled N2O emissions under mild alternate wetting and drying irrigation by 17.4% but reduced the global warming potential (GWP) (methane (CH4)+N2O) by 62.9%.

The most suitable sensor depends on the substrate material and desired measurement, either volumetric water content or water potential. The key points of the paper as they relate to timer-based irrigation systems are as follows:\\n\\n* Timer-based systems are ineffective since water requirements vary by species, season, microclimate, and changes in root density or leaf area as the plant grows.\\n* Inconsistent water application can waste water on cooler and cloudy days, or result in water deficiencies during periods of peak water demand.\\n* Sensor-based irrigation systems offer a more efficient method of irrigation by measuring substrate water status and relaying that information to an irrigation controller.\\n* The irrigation controller is programmed to control irrigation valves based on set points, opening valves when the water level falls below a set point and closing valves when the upper set point is reached.\\n* VWC and soil water potential are the two main properties of interest for scheduling irrigation.\\n\\nThis study found that sensor-based irrigation systems have the potential to address the inefficiencies of timer-based systems and improve water usage in nurseries whilst also improving seedling quality, reducing leaching of nutrients, and lowering the incidence of pathogen infestation.\",\n",

However, they can be ineffective and inefficient since water requirements may vary by species, season, microclimate and changes in root density or leaf area as the plant grows (Lea-Cox, 2012). For example, such systems can waste water on cooler and cloudy days due to fixed irrigation schedules which operate irrespective of weather changes (Van Iersel et al., 2011).\",\n",

Lensky, explores the use of remote sensing methods, particularly hyperspectral (HS), thermal (TIR), and RGB vegetation indices, for the monitoring and early detection of stress in outdoor vertical greenery systems (VGS). The authors investigated two case studies of VGS installations in which yellowing symptoms were visible.\\n\\nTo establish a time series for VGS monitoring, the authors employed three primary methods: HS imaging to separate plant species and identify subtle differences in vegetation that may not be visible to the naked eye; TIR imaging to capture temperature differences as an indicator of plant health; and RGB imaging to calculate vegetation indices that provide quantitative and qualitative insights into specific vegetation features, such as chlorophyll and water content.\\n\\nThe authors used unsupervised classification techniques on HS and TIR images to detect stressed pixels, which were successfully identified 14-35 days before the visual yellowing occurred. This early detection is crucial because it enables timely intervention to prevent irreversible damage to the plants.\\n\\nFurthermore, the authors highlighted the value of TIR imaging in providing spatial information on water distribution along the VGS. The thermal index allowed the differentiation between areas with sufficient water and areas experiencing water stress, which can aid in optimizing irrigation strategies and preventing localized damage to the vegetation.\\n\\nIn summary, the paper demonstrates the potential of remote sensing methods for precision agriculture in outdoor VGS.
